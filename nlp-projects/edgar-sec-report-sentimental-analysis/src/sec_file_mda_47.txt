elimination was 15.2 million and 18.0 million for the quarters ended june 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. the decrease reflects increases in lease expenses. property and casualty repwest's premiums were 30.4 million and 33.8 million for the quarters ended march 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. the decrease is largely a result of a restructuring of the u haul business auto general liability policy. this reduced premiums by 5.2 million for the quarter ended march 31, 2000 as compared to 1999. general agency premium increased to 7.6 million for the quarter ended march 31, 2000 from 4.0 million for the quarter ended march 31, 1999. direct multiple peril and assumed treaty reinsurance premium remained constant at 15.4 million and 15.3 million for the quarters ended march 31, 2000 and

ended march 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. the increase of 0.3 million represents a decrease in incurred losses and loss adjusting expenses over a decrease in earned premiums of 0.6 million and a decrease in realized gains of 0.2 million. 21 life insurance net premiums increased to 25.5 million from 25.1 million for the quarters ended march 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, primarily due to premium increases in its medicare supplement business. net investment income before intercompany eliminations increased to 5.8 million from 5.5 million for the quarters ended march 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, due to improved interest rate spreads on the retirement savings products. benefits increased to 17.7 million from 15.4 million for the quarters ended march 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. this increase is primarily due to higher loss ratios in both medicare supplement and credit insurance. medicare supplement benefits are up 24 from 1999 in relation to the amount of insurance in force, which is also up 24 . credit insurance loss ratios have increased from 1999 when oxford had better than expected loss experience. amortization of dac was 4.7 million and 4.6 million for the quarters ended march 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. operating expenses decreased 1.1 million to 5.7 million from 6.8 million for the quarters ended march 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. reductions in general administrative expenses and commissions account for this difference. operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was 3.3 million and 3.9 million for the quarters ended march 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. the decrease from 1999 reflects increased loss ratios in the credit insurance and medicare supplement lines offset by improved investment returns and lower operating expenses. interest expense interest expense was 22.8 million and 20.2 million for the quarters ended june 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. the increase can be attributed to increases in the average debt outstanding and in the average cost of debt. consolidated group as a result of the foregoing, pretax earnings totaled 58.4 million and 65.4 million for the quarters ended

operations to meet the needs of its customers, u haul must maintain a large inventory of fixed asset rental items. at june 30, 2000, net property, plant and equipment represented approximately 62.4 of total assets from non insurance operations and approximately 42.1 of consolidated assets. in the quarters ended june 30, 2000 and 1999, capital expenditures were 143.0 million and 107.1 million, respectively. these expenditures primarily reflect the expansion of the rental truck fleet. the capital required to fund these acquisitions was obtained through internally generated funds from operations and through lease financings. cash provided by operating activities was 21.1 million and 74.1 million for the quarters ended june 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. the decrease resulted primarily from decreases in the accounts payable and intercompany payable balances along with decreased earnings. at june 30, 2000, total outstanding notes and loans payable was 1,123.6 million as compared to 1,137.8 million at march 31, 2000. real estate operations cash provided by operating activities was 3.2 million and 0.4 million for the quarters ended june 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. the increase resulted from a combination of an increase in the intercompany payable balance, offset by decreased earnings. property and casualty cash used by operating activities was 5.8 million and 3.8 million for quarters ended march 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. this change resulted from decreased other liabilities and a larger decrease in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. intercompany receivables due from affiliates and unearned premium reserves decreased. repwest's cash and cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio were 1.2 million and 7.0 million at march 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. short term assets increased 5.5 million from march 31, 1999 to march 31, 2000, while cash on deposit decreased 11.3 million. this 5.8 million net decrease resulted from increased receivables, claim settlements and incurred commissions. repwest maintains a diversified securities investment portfolio, primarily in bonds, at varying maturity levels with 88.0 of the fixed income securities consisting of investment grade securities. the maturity distribution is designed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future cash needs. current liquidity remains strong with current invested assets equal to 95.6 of total liabilities. the liability for reported and unreported losses are based upon company historical and industry averages. unpaid loss adjustment expenses are based on historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid. unpaid loss and loss expenses are not discounted. 24 life insurance oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts from interest sensitive products and investment income. the primary uses of cash are operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders. matching the investment portfolio to the cash flow demands of the types of insurance being written is an important consideration. cash provided used by operating activities was 1.5 million and 1.2 million for the quarters ended march 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. the increase in cash flows from operating activities relates to better ratio of collected premium to paid claims. cash provided by financing activities were 3.1 million and 5.4 million for the quarters ended march 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. the decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities for the first quarter of 2000 compared to the first quarter of 1999 is due to a lower ratio of annuity deposits to withdrawals. in addition to cash flows from operating and financing activities, a substantial amount of liquid funds is available through oxford's short term portfolio. at march 31, 2000 and 1999, short term investments were 65.1 million and 77.2 million, respectively. management believes that the overall sources of liquidity will continue to meet foreseeable cash needs. consolidated group during each of the fiscal years ended march 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, amerco estimates gross capital expenditures will average approximately 380 million primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation. this level of capital expenditures, combined with an average of approximately 72 million in annual long term debt maturities during this same period, are expected to create annual average funding needs of approximately 452 million. management estimates that the company will fund 100 of these requirements with internally generated funds. credit agreements amerco's operations are funded by various credit and financing arrangements, including unsecured long term borrowings, unsecured medium term notes and revolving lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks. principally to finance its fleet of trucks and trailers, amerco routinely enters into sale and leaseback transactions. as of june 30, 2000, amerco had 1,123.6 million in total notes and loans payable outstanding and unutilized lines of credit of approximately 365.0 million. certain of amerco's credit agreements contain restrictive financial and other covenants, including, among others, covenants with respect to incurring additional indebtedness, maintaining certain financial ratios and placing certain additional liens on its properties and assets. at june 30, 2000, amerco was in compliance with these covenants. amerco is further restricted in the issuance of certain types of preferred stock. amerco is prohibited from issuing shares of preferred stock that provide for any mandatory redemption, sinking fund payment, or mandatory prepayment, or that allow the holders thereof to require amerco or any subsidiary of amerco to repurchase such preferred
