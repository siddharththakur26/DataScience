other information dallas love field in 1968, as part of an agreement between the cities of fort worth and dallas to build and operate dallas fort worth airport dfw , a bond ordinance was enacted by both cities the bond ordinance . the bond ordinance required both cities to direct all scheduled interstate passenger operations to dfw and was an integral part of the bonds issued for the construction and operation of dfw. in 1979, as part of a settlement to resolve litigation with southwest airlines, the cities agreed to expand the scope of operations allowed under the bond ordinance at dallas' love field. congress enacted the wright amendment to prevent the federal government from acting inconsistent with this agreement. the wright amendment limited interstate operations at love field to the four states contiguous to texas new mexico, oklahoma, arkansas, and louisiana and prohibited through ticketing to any destination outside that perimeter. in 1997, without the consent of either city, congress amended the wright amendment by i adding three states kansas, mississippi, and alabama to the perimeter and ii removing some federal restrictions on large aircraft configured with 56 seats or less the 1997 amendment . in october 1997, the city of fort worth filed suit in state district court against the city of dallas and others seeking to enforce the bond ordinance. fort worth contended that the 1997 amendment does not preclude the city of dallas from exercising its proprietary rights to restrict traffic at love field in a manner consistent with the bond ordinance and, moreover, that dallas has an obligation to do so. american joined in this litigation. on october 15, 1998, the state district court granted summary judgment in favor of american and fort worth. on may 25, 2000, the fort worth court of appeals overturned the district court order and concluded that the bond ordinance was preempted by federal law. american and fort worth filed motions asking the fort worth court of appeals to reconsider its decision. in the same lawsuit, dfw filed claims alleging that irrespective of whether the bond ordinance was enforceable, the dfw use agreement prohibited american and other dfw signatory airlines from moving any interstate operations to love field. dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of texas, dallas division, seeking to have the court declare that, as a matter of law, the 1997 amendment precludes the city of dallas from exercising any restrictions on operations at love field. further, in may 1998, continental airlines and continental express filed a lawsuit in dallas federal court seeking a judicial declaration that the bond ordinance cannot be enforced to prevent them from operating flights from love field to cleveland using regional jets. these two federal court lawsuits were consolidated and stayed. 12 15 in december 1998, the department of transportation dot issued an order on the federal law questions concerning the bond ordinance, local proprietary powers, dfw's use agreement with dfw carriers such as american, and the wright and 1997 amendments, and concluded that the bond ordinance was preempted by federal law and was therefore not enforceable. the dot also found that the dfw use agreement did not preclude american from conducting interstate operations at love field. fort worth, american and dfw appealed the dot's order to the fifth circuit court of appeals, and on february 1, 2000, the fifth circuit affirmed the dot's order in all respects. american, fort worth and dfw each filed petitions for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court, which were denied on june 29, 2000. shortly thereafter, american, fort worth and dfw dismissed all remaining motions and claims in the texas state court litigation. consequently, litigation over the right to provide scheduled passenger operations at love field on aircraft with fewer than 57 seats to destinations beyond the wright amendment perimeter has ended. in january 2000, the department of justice, at the behest of the dot, filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of texas, dallas division, against fort worth and american seeking to enforce the dot's order and to prevent any party from interfering with any carrier operating under that order. on may 1, 2000, american commenced service from love field to chicago and los angeles using terminal space leased from continental express on a short term basis. american has further announced that it will offer service from love field to new york's laguardia airport commencing august 31, 2000. american is seeking long term facilities at love field from the city of dallas for its love field operations. as a result of the foregoing, an increase in operations at love field and or the inability of american to obtain adequate facilities to compete effectively at love field could adversely impact american's business. industry consolidation two competitors of the company, ual corporation and us airways group, inc., recently announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement. if that merger were to be consummated or other significant consolidation were to occur in the airline industry, conditions and competition in the industry could be significantly altered. if the company were involved in a business combination with a competitor, the financial condition and prospects of the resulting corporation could be materially different from those of the company. forward looking information statements in this report contain various forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act
