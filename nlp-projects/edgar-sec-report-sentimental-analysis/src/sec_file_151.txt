Item
1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
General
Spherix
Incorporated (the “Company” or “Registrant”), a Delaware corporation, was
founded in 1967.  The Company consists of
a biotechnology segment (“BioSpherix”) and an information services segment (“InfoSpherix”).  At the May 2005 annual meeting shareholders
approved the establishment of InfoSpherix as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Spherix, which took effect January 2006.
The principal
executive offices of the Company are located at 12051 Indian Creek Court,
Beltsville, Maryland 20705, and its telephone number is (301) 419-3900.  The Company’s Common Stock trades on the
NASDAQ Global Market system under the symbol SPEX.
Available
Information
Our principal Internet address is www.spherix.com.  We make available free of charge on www.spherix.com
our annual, quarterly and current reports, and amendments to those reports, as
soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with,
or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
BioSpherix
This division is
the Company’s biotechnology research and development arm, dedicated to
developing proprietary products with a view toward commercial
applications.  The Company has
accumulated a number of patents on the products and processes developed by
BioSpherix.  As set forth below, these
products are in the development stage and will require substantial additional
investment to bring any of these products to market.
Tagatose as a
Low-Calorie, Full-Bulk Sweetener.  Spherix has patented the use of a naturally
occurring sugar, tagatose, as a low-calorie, full-bulk sweetener.  It is a true sugar that looks, feels, and
tastes like table sugar.  The Company has
developed and patented a method for making tagatose from whey or lactose.  Whey is a waste product from cheese
manufacturing.
2 


 
The Firm has been
developing its sweetener since receiving a U.S. patent for its use and
manufacture as a low-calorie sweetener in 1988, which patent expired August 29,
2006.  The Company received two U.S.
patents for its tagatose production process in 1991 and 1992, which both expire
July 19, 2009.  It has received a number
of foreign patents corresponding to these three and other U.S. patents.  These countries include Canada and Japan,
both large potential markets.
In January 1997,
the Company completed a license agreement with Arla Foods Ingredients amba (“Arla”)
(formerly MD Foods Ingredients amba, “MDFI”) of Denmark for the exclusive,
worldwide rights to market and distribute tagatose as a food and beverage
ingredient in return for a non-refundable up-front payment and fees on net
sales of the sugar for these purposes. 
Arla manufactures a wide variety of dairy products, foods and food
ingredients; it ranks as one of the largest dairy products manufacturers in the
world.  Arla operates cheese plants
producing large amounts of whey as a by-product.  The License Agreement and an amendment
thereto provide Arla the world-wide right to manufacture and sell tagatose for
food uses, and the right to manufacture tagatose for all uses.
A panel of experts
retained by Arla declared tagatose as Generally Recognized As Safe (“GRAS”) on
April 11, 2001, permitting sale of tagatose as a food ingredient in the
U.S.  The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (“FDA”) issued a “no objection” letter on October 25, 2001.  Tagatose was recommended by the Joint FAO/WHO
Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) panel in June 2001 to its many
member countries for use in foods, and in June 2004, JECFA removed its former
limit on daily consumption of tagatose. 
In 2003, approval was obtained in South Korea.  In April 2004, tagatose was approved by the
Food Standards Australia New Zealand (“FSANZ”), the food health and safety
agency for Australia and New Zealand.  In
December 2005, tagatose was approved in the European Union.  Arla has begun the approval process for
tagatose in Canada, Japan and Mexico.
The U.S. FDA
approved Arla’s recommended caloric value of 1.5 kilocalories per gram,
permitting labeling of products containing it as “reduced calorie” in the U.S.
In 2002, Arla
formed a 50/50 joint venture with Nordzucker, a German sugar producer, for the
manufacture and sale of tagatose.  The
joint venture factory was capable of producing 1,200 metric tons per year.  At present Arla believes it has produced a
sufficient backlog of inventory to satisfy its needs for the foreseeable future
based on current demand, and accordingly has stopped production at its pilot
plant until there is a sufficient increase in the demand for tagatose.  To date, Spherix has earned minimal royalties
from Arla and given the cessation of production by Arla, Spherix does not
currently expect to receive any future royalties.  With Spherix’s efforts focusing on the
non-food potentials of Naturlose, the Company is pursing the possibility of
recovering its technology from Arla or securing other production options.
Spherix retains
the rights to the non-food uses to tagatose. 
The Company has discovered and patented a number of health and medical
uses for its product, which it has branded “Naturlose®” for uses in health and
medicine as outlined below.  A priority
among these patented uses is the use of Naturlose in treating Type 2 diabetes.
Treatment
for Type 2 Diabetes. 
Trials at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have found
tagatose effective as a treatment of Type 2 diabetes in humans.  In addition to alleviating symptoms of this
major disease, over the one-year trial, all subjects lost weight at physician-approved
rates and showed a significant increase in the desirable type of cholesterol,
HDL.  Other than for initial laxation at
high doses (45 to 75 grams per capita per day), accommodated in about two
weeks, no untoward effects were found in any of the research.  In addition, the studies found that Naturlose
produced no rise in blood glucose or insulin levels in diabetic or normal
subjects.  Naturlose taken before the
consumption of glucose produced a blunting effect on the otherwise normally
expected rise in blood glucose.
In late 2005, the
FDA gave BioSpherix permission to begin a Phase 3 clinical trial for Naturlose
as a stand-alone drug to treat diabetes. 
Since then, BioSpherix’s research and development (R&D) activity has
been focused primarily on planning and instituting the Phase 3 trial. The Phase
3 clinical trial is the last major test, if successful, before requesting drug
approval.  The Company has negotiated two
agreements with contract research organizations (CRO) to conduct the trial, and
has retained Environ International, an FDA regulatory consultant, to guide the
trial.
The Company has
completed the dose range-finding study and will now proceed with recruiting
patients for the trial, which will take place in Australia and the United
States.  The first participants are
expected to begin the Phase 3 clinical trial in April 2007.  More than 300 subjects from the United States
and abroad, representing the demographic mix in the U.S., will receive oral
doses of Naturlose to test its ability to treat Type 2 diabetes.  A Phase 3 clinical trial, which gathers
evidence regarding effectiveness and safety, is needed to evaluate the overall
benefit-risk relationship of new drugs proposed to the FDA.  The Company believes its chances for a
successful outcome are enhanced by the widely demonstrated safety of the
product; lack of safety being the primary cause for failure of most drug
candidates.
3 


 
Anti-plaque
Agent:  In 2005, the Company contracted
with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct human clinical
trials on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose.  The study demonstrated tagatose to be much
more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is sorbitol, a sugar
substitute that is widely used in oral care products.  The study suggested ways of modifying the Naturlose
product to effect desired plaque reduction. 
Such modifications have been made, and the Company has arranged with the
University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a trial of Naturlose
toothpaste formulated by the Company in an attempt to establish an anti-plaque
claim for the toothpaste.  The clinical
trial started in early 2007.
Anti-hyperglycemic
Agent.  Tagatose
functions as an anti-hyperglycemic agent to prevent the formation of
advanced glycosylation end-products, which is one of the major causes of aging.
Increasing
the shelf life of stored blood, platelets and medicinal proteins.  The outsourced project seeking to establish
the use of Naturlose to extend the shelf-life of blood fractions and various
other medical products has been suspended as BioSpherix concentrates on the
Type 2 diabetes trial.
Anemia
and Hemophilia Treatment. 
Naturlose has been shown to improve blood factors indicating that
tagatose may be useful as a drug or drug adjuvant in the treatment of anemia
and hemophilia.
Increased
Fertility and Improved Fetal Development Drug.  Naturlose may increase the fertility of
humans and other animals, to effect higher percentages of live fetuses, and to
cause those fetuses to be heavier, but within normal bounds, than those of human
or animal controls.
Preservative
of Human Organs. 
Naturlose has shown potential for use in the transplanting and storage
of human organs to protect against cyto-oxidation and toxic chemicals.
Prototypes of
Naturlose-based mouthwash, cough syrup, and a fiber digestive aid have been
developed by BioSpherix.  Other projects
are in the conceptual stage.
All of the
potential uses mentioned above require further clinical trial studies and
regulatory approval before they can be brought to market.
Capital for
Development.  While the
products under development show promise, continued progress is dependent upon
many factors, including, but not limited to, the Company’s having sufficient
funds and resources to pursue them.  Over
its history, the Company has supported its research and development in part by
using funds generated by InfoSpherix; however, due to the capital needs of
InfoSpherix, and bank covenants restrictions, InfoSpherix may not be able to
support the activities of BioSpherix. 
Funds have also been raised from private placements of Company stock and
warrants, some of the proceeds of which have been used to increase the state of
development, market penetration and sales of the products mentioned above.  The Company believes that it will require
substantial amounts of additional capital to develop and bring its BioSpherix
products to market.  In order to fully
develop, manufacture, distribute and sell Naturlose for these purposes, the
Company is seeking to raise funds and will also seek a relationship with a
major pharmaceutical company.
BioSpherix revenue
accounted for less than 1% of the Company’s total revenue in 2006.
InfoSpherix
Incorporated
In January 2006,
the InfoSpherix business started operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Spherix Incorporated under the name “InfoSpherix Incorporated.”
InfoSpherix professionals design and operate contact centers,
websites, and field kiosks providing information management and materials to
the public on various socially beneficial subjects, as well as other information
services, such as reservations and tourism. 
InfoSpherix focuses on those clients who are looking to leverage
technology in the ever-advancing world of information management.  InfoSpherix researches, collects, organizes
and disseminates information by providing customized contact center services
combining advanced data collection systems, expert decision support systems,
tele-support utilizing live operators, and advanced telecommunication
technologies such as
4 


 
Interactive Voice
Response (“IVR”).  InfoSpherix answers
millions of calls annually from professionals and the public nationwide.  It operates a contact center in Cumberland,
Maryland and a second contact center in Carmel, Indiana.  During 2006, the operations of the Rapid
City, South Dakota contact center were relocated to Carmel, Indiana.  All contact centers efficiently manage and
track high volumes of data.  Coupling
InfoSpherix’s expert staff with its advanced technologies results in an
effective system to collect and disseminate large amounts of information.  The Company also provides reservation
services for campgrounds and other parks via its ReserveWorld business
line.  Since 1998, InfoSpherix has grown its
government park reservation business from one contract to seventeen park reservation
contracts.  InfoSpherix is one of only
two major companies in this market.  In
2006, Spherix won a new park reservation contract, won the re-compete on two
park reservation contracts, and will be the subcontractor on another.  InfoSpherix’s reservation business accounted
for 64% of the Company’s revenue in 2006.
In October 2006,
the Company agreed to a $6 million settlement to end its longstanding legal
dispute with the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the government’s award of
a national park and reservation contract to ReserveAmerica.  The Company operated the National Park
Service contract for nine years; revenue recognized was $4.0 million, $4.0
million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, or 16%, 17% and 17% of total revenue for each year.  The Company’s National Park Service contract
ended January 23, 2007.
InfoSpherix
accounted for substantially all of the Company’s revenue in 2006.  Most of InfoSpherix’s revenue traditionally
has been generated by a few large government contracts.  See Note 1, “Concentrations,” of the Notes to
the consolidated Financial Statements included herein pursuant to Part II of
this Form 10-K.
Government
Contracts
See Note 10, “Commitment
and Contingencies — Government Contracts,”
of the Notes to the Financial Statements included herein pursuant to Part II,
Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by
reference.
Government
contracts typically have terms and conditions which, while providing annual or
multi-year terms, subject them to termination upon convenience or default.
Industry
Segments
See Note 13, “Information
by Business Segment,” of the Notes to the Financial Statements included herein
pursuant to Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for industry segment information
of the Company, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
Market
Concentration
During 2006, 2005,
and 2004, essentially all of the Company’s revenue was generated by
InfoSpherix.  The Company’s business
operations are usually dependent upon substantial revenue from a select group
of customers.  In 2006, 2005, and 2004,
revenue from the U.S. Government, the State of Michigan and the State of
Maryland each accounted for more than 10% of total Company revenue.
It is currently
expected that revenue from the U.S. Government, the State of Michigan, the
State of Maryland, and the State of Ohio will each account for more than 10% of
total Company revenue in 2007.

systems industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change.  The Company is in competition with other
information services companies across the nation.  Many of these competitors have substantially
greater financial and technical resources than the Company.  While acknowledging strong competition from
other information services firms, the Company has developed a specialized niche
by concentrating on high quality, personalized service combined with
computerization for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.  The Company has established a reputation for
rapidly starting up information projects to meet its clients’ critical needs,
while not compromising high quality and reasonable pricing.  The Company has also established a successful
niche in government campground reservation services and is now one of only two
major suppliers of campground services in the U.S.  The other major supplier is
IAC/InterActiveCorp’s ReserveAmerica, a subsidiary of Ticketmaster.  Over the last three years, the Company has
invested over $3 million in computer and telephony systems and nearly $3
million in the development of specialized computer software products to improve
its competitive position.  The Company
continues to upgrade and enhance those systems.
BioSpherix
Competitors of
BioSpherix are numerous and include, among others, major pharmaceutical,
chemical, consumer, and biotechnology companies, specialized firms,
universities and other research institutions. 
The Company’s competitors may succeed in developing technologies and
products that are more effective than any that are being developed by the
Company, and that could render the Company’s technology and potential products
obsolete and noncompetitive.  Many of
these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources
and production and marketing capabilities than the Company.
Research
and Development
BioSpherix
expenditures for research and development were approximately $884,000,
$288,000, and $196,000 in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.  These expenditures were incurred primarily in
the ongoing efforts to commercialize Naturlose, including its development for
drug uses and improved production processes.
Governmental
Regulation
The business
activities of the Company are subject to a variety of Federal and state
compliance, licensing, and certification requirements.  Management believes that the Company is, and
has been at all times, in full compliance with Federal and state environmental
protection and worker safety laws.
The Company is
also required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  On September 21, 2005, the SEC announced the
extension of the compliance dates of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
non-accelerated filers.  Under the
extension, non-accelerated filers, such as Spherix, will begin to comply with
the internal control over financial reporting requirements for the first fiscal
year ending on or after December 15, 2007. 
The Company anticipates that the cost of implementing Section 404 over
the next two years could have a material impact on the results of operations.
Environment
Compliance with
current federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the
environment, has not had, and in the opinion of management will not have, a
material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations,
capital expenditures, cash flows or competitive position.
7 


 
Employees
In 2006, the
Company employed an average of 588 individuals on a full- or part-time
basis.  Of this total, approximately 344
were full-time employees.  The Company’s
employees are not currently unionized, and management believes that its relation
with the Company’s employees are harmonious.
Geographic
Areas
InfoSpherix’s
business is, and has been, based in the United States.  Accordingly, InfoSpherix revenue is entirely
from U.S.-based operations.
Item 1A.  RISK FACTORS
Any of the risk
factors we describe below could severely harm our business, financial condition
and operating results.  The market price
of our common stock could decline if one or more of these risks and
uncertainties develop into actual events.
RISKS
RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS
WE CONTINUE
TO BE DEPENDENT ON OUR INFORMATION SERVICES DIVISION FOR ALL OF OUR REVENUE.  In each of 2006 and 2005, our information
services segment accounted for nearly 100% of our revenue.  Despite licensing tagatose in 1996 for food
and beverage use, our principal biotechnology product, we have yet to receive
any substantial royalties from the sales of tagatose by our licensee.  We are actively pursuing various non-food
uses of Naturlose, including as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  Thus, we have incurred substantial and
continuing losses in our biotechnology segment which have adversely affected
our overall financial results.  If we
continue to be unsuccessful in commercializing our biotechnology products, our
financial results will continue to be adversely affected to the detriment of
our stock price.
OUR
LARGEST INFORMATION SERVICES CONTRACT WAS AWARDED TO A COMPETITOR.  In October 2006, the Company agreed to a $6
million settlement to end its longstanding legal dispute with the U.S.
Department of Agriculture over the government’s award of the National
Recreation Reservation Service (NRRS) contract to ReserveAmerica, a
Ticketmaster subsidiary.  The Company’s
National Park Service contract ended January 23, 2007.  The National Park Service contract contributed
$4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2006.  We will need to replace it with
other work to avoid an adverse impact on our financial results.
OUR
INFORMATION SERVICES BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT
CHANGES IN THE CONTRACTING OR FISCAL POLICIES OF THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  We derive substantial revenue from contracts
with the U.S. federal government and we believe that the success and
development of our business will continue to depend on our successful
participation in U.S. federal government contract programs.  Accordingly, changes in U.S. federal
government contracting policies could directly affect our financial
performance.  Among the factors that
could have a material adverse affect on our U.S. federal government contracting
business are:
·                  budgetary
constraints affecting U.S. federal government spending generally, or specific
departments or agencies in particular, and changes in fiscal policies or
available funding;
·                  technological
developments;
·                  U.S. federal
governmental shutdowns and other potential delays in the government
appropriations process;
·                  delays in the
payment of our invoices by government payment offices due to problems with, or
upgrades to, government information systems, or for other reasons;
·                  competition and
consolidation in the information services industry; and
·                  general economic
conditions.
OUR
INFORMATION SERVICES BUSINESS IS RELIANT ON TECHNOLOGY.  We have devoted significant resources to
developing and acquiring specialized hardware and software in our information
services business.  In order to remain
competitive, we must continue to select, invest in, acquire and develop new and
enhanced technology on a timely basis. 
We may not be successful in these efforts or in anticipating
developments in technology.  In addition,
competitors could develop similar applications. 
Third parties could independently develop similar technology, obtain
unauthorized access to our proprietary technology or misappropriate technology
to which we have granted access.  Failure
to remain current with technology or misappropriation of our technology could
adversely affect our ability to compete for information services business and
could lead to reduced business and reduced financial results.
8 


 
WE HAVE
NOT YET SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZED NATURLOSE.  We are in the process of attempting to
develop other uses of tagatose, under the brand name Naturlose, in non-food
products such as a treatment for diabetes, toothpaste, mouthwash, and
over-the-counter and pharmaceutical drugs. 
Efforts are presently limited to the Type 2 diabetes clinical trial and
toothpaste developments because of cash limitations.  To date, we have yet to secure any
substantial revenue from Naturlose sales. 
One of the hurdles we will have to overcome is that our foreign licensee
for tagatose (which has the right to manufacture tagatose) does not currently
have sufficient capacity to manufacture enough tagatose to supply both food and
nonfood markets if such markets mature and grow.  Failure to successfully commercialize
Naturlose may adversely affect our stock price.
OTHER
BIOTECH PRODUCTS ARE STILL IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE.  We are developing other biotech
products.  None of these have been
developed to a stage where any significant revenue has been generated.  Development of products will require
significant additional research and development.  Such additional effort will require
substantial funding which may not be available to us.  Further, our research and development
activities may not result in any saleable products.  It is also possible that we will license or
seek an affiliation with a third party to bring some products to market.  In such an event, we would likely have
minimal control over the manufacture and marketing of such products.
DEVELOPMENT
OF ANY BIOTECH PRODUCTS WILL DEPEND ON OBTAINING FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY
APPROVALS.  Development
of new products is subject to extensive regulation by governmental regulatory
authorities in the United States and other countries.  These rigorous regulatory approval processes
can take five to ten years or more and require the expenditure of substantial
resources.  We may not be able to obtain
the necessary approvals for clinical testing or for the marketing of
products.  Continuing failure to
commercialize biotechnology products may adversely affect our financial results
and stock price.
OUR
SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN PATENT
PROTECTION FOR OUR PRODUCTS. 
We have several patents for tagatose and other products under
development.  We may not be able to
obtain additional patents.  Further,
future patents may not be held valid if subsequently challenged.  Failure to obtain and maintain patent
protection for our biotechnology products may further delay or eliminate our
ability to commercialize such products, which may adversely affect our
financial results and stock price.
WE HAVE
SUSTAINED LOSSES IN THE PAST AND WE MAY SUSTAIN LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.  We have incurred losses in prior years,
including the years 2005 and 2004. Our net losses for the years ended December
31, 2005 and 2004 were $2.8 million and $2.8 million, respectively.  Our net income for the year ended December
31, 2006, included $6 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture settlement.  We may not return to profitable operations.
WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING THAT WE WILL NEED.  During 2006, our working
capital increased by $7.7 million, largely as a result of proceeds from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture settlement and proceeds from stock
issuances.  In recent years, we have
funded our operations through private placements of our common stock and
through the exercise of warrants issued in connection with such private
placement transactions.  We believe that
we will need to raise additional funding to continue to finance our product
development operations.  We may not be
able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all.  Failure to obtain required financing may
cause us to curtail or cease our operations.
WE MAY
NOT BE ABLE TO RETAIN OUR KEY EXECUTIVES AND PERSONNEL.  As a small company, our success depends on the
services of key employees in executive and other positions.  None of our key employees have employment
agreements.  The loss of the services of
one or more of such employees could have a material adverse effect on us.
WE FACE
INTENSE COMPETITION BY COMPETITORS IN BOTH DIVISIONS.  Our competitors in the information services
business are numerous.  Many of our
competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and distribution
resources than we do.  Our principal
information services competitor, ReserveAmerica, is a division of Ticketmaster
which is a subsidiary of IAC/InterActive Corp., a significantly larger public
company than Spherix.  Our competitors
may succeed in developing or marketing technologies and biotechnology products
that are more effective than ours.

RISKS
RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK
THE PRICE
OF SPHERIX’S COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN HIGHLY VOLATILE DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS WHICH
WILL CONTINUE TO EFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK.  Our common stock has traded as low as $1.18
and as high as $3.92 between January 2, 2006 and December 29, 2006. Some of the
factors leading to this volatility include:
·                  relatively small
amounts of our stock trading on any given day;
·                  fluctuations in
our operating results;
·                  announcements of
technological innovations or new products which we or our competitors make;
·                  developments
with respect to patents or proprietary rights.
CORNELL
CAPITAL PARTNERS WILL PAY LESS THAN THE MARKET PRICE AND WILL HAVE AN INCENTIVE
TO SELL ITS SHARES, WHICH MAY CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.  Cornell Capital Partners will purchase shares
of our common stock pursuant to the Standby Equity Distribution Agreement
(SEDA) at a purchase price that is less than the then-prevailing market price
of our common stock.  Cornell Capital
Partners will have an incentive to immediately sell any shares of our common
stock that it purchases pursuant to the SEDA to realize a gain on the
difference between the purchase price and the then-prevailing market price of
our common stock.  To the extent Cornell
Capital Partners sells its common stock, the common stock price may decrease.
NEW
SHAREHOLDERS WILL EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DILUTION FROM OUR SALE OF SHARES UNDER
THE SEDA.  The sale of
shares pursuant to the SEDA will have a dilutive impact on our
stockholders.  As a result, our net
income per share could decrease in future periods, and the market price of our
common stock could decline.  In addition,
the lower our stock price, the more shares of common stock we will have to
issue under the SEDA.  If our stock price
is lower, then our existing stockholders would experience greater dilution.
OUR
COMMON STOCK WILL BE DELISTED FROM NASDAQ GLOBAL MARKET SYSTEM IF WE FAIL TO
COMPLY WITH CONTINUED LISTING STANDARDS.  We were previously advised that we were in
danger of our common stock being delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market due to
our stockholders’ equity falling below the $10 million minimum
requirement.  At December 31, 2006, the
Company’s shareholder’s equity was $14.6 million.  If at some point we are unable to meet the
listing standards, we intend to apply to list our common stock on the NASDAQ
Capital Market.
DIVIDENDS
ON OUR COMMON STOCK ARE NOT LIKELY.  We
intend to retain future earnings, if any, in order to provide funds for use in
the operation and expansion of our business and for further research and
development.  Accordingly, we do not
anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable
future.  Investors must look solely to
appreciation in the market price of the shares of our common stock to obtain a
return on their investment.
BECAUSE
OF THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT AND “ANTI-TAKEOVER” PROVISIONS IN OUR CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS, A THIRD PARTY MAY BE DISCOURAGED FROM MAKING A
TAKEOVER OFFER WHICH COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS.  In 2001, we adopted a shareholder rights
plan.  The effect of this rights plan and
of certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, and the
anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay
or prevent a third party from acquiring us or replacing members of our board of
directors, even if the acquisition or the replacements would be beneficial to
our stockholders.  These factors could
also reduce the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares
of the common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be
without these provisions.
INSIDERS
OWN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH COULD LIMIT OUR
STOCKHOLDERS’ ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF KEY TRANSACTIONS.  As of December 31, 2006, our officers and
directors and their affiliates owned approximately 20% of the outstanding
shares of our common stock.  As a result,
our officers and directors are able to exert considerable influence over the
outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock,
including the election of our Board of Directors.  The voting power of these stockholders could
prevent or frustrate attempts to effect a transaction that is in the best
interests of the other stockholders and could also discourage others from
seeking to purchase our common stock, which might depress the price of our
common stock.
10 


 
WE
EXPERIENCE QUARTERLY VARIATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  We have experienced and expect to continue to
experience quarterly variations in revenue and operating income as a result of
many factors, including the seasonality of our information services business,
timing of customers’ budget processes and slowdowns or accelerations of work by
customers.  General work economic
conditions may result in customer deferral of projects or cancellation in
planned expenditures.  These factors may
adversely affect our financial results and our stock price.
Item 1B.  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.
Item 2.  PROPERTIES
In November 1997,
the Company signed a lease agreement effective May 1, 1998, for 51,625 square
feet of office, call center, research labs, and warehouse space in the same
Beltsville, Maryland, facility previously occupied, under the terms of a lease
that expires on February 28, 2009.  This
facility contains corporate administration, human resources, accounting, sales
and marketing, technical services and warehousing, for support of both
InfoSpherix and BioSpherix, and through September 2005 contained call center
operations for InfoSpherix.
In November 2003,
the Company signed a lease agreement for 31,526 square feet of office and call
center space in Cumberland, Maryland. 
This lease has been extended to coincide with the Company’s move from
this facility to another facility in the area, but no later than February 28,
2008.  The new lease agreement for 32,423
square feet of office and call center space in Frostburg, Maryland, was signed
in February 2007.  The lease is targeted
to commence December 1, 2007, and expire November 30, 2017.
In 2004, as part
of its acquisition of certain assets of Daksoft, Inc.’s reservation business,
the Company signed an agreement to lease 8,280 square feet of call center space
in Rapid City, South Dakota.  The lease
expired December 31, 2006.
In 2006, the
Company signed an agreement to lease up to 18,601 square feet of call center
space in Carmel, Indiana, effective April 1, 2006.  The lease expires December 31, 2011.  During 2006, the operations of the Rapid
City, South Dakota facility were transferred to the Carmel, Indiana facility.
In 2004, the
Company signed an agreement to lease 5,000 square feet of office, research lab
and warehouse space for BioSpherix in Annapolis, Maryland.  The lease expires June 30, 2009.
Throughout 2006,
the Beltsville, Carmel and Annapolis facilities had sufficient capacity.  The Cumberland and Rapid City facilities were
operating at an estimated 75%-90% capacity during the peak months.

System under the symbol SPEX.  No cash
dividends have been paid.
                As

stock was approximately 7,000.  The
following table states the high and low sales prices of the Company’s common

                The Company recognized that, as
of June 30, 2005, it was approximately $454,000 short of meeting NASDAQ’s
Global Market listing requirement of maintaining a minimum of $10,000,000 in
shareholders’ equity.  NASDAQ gave the
Company until September 1, 2005, to correct this situation, which the Company
achieved through its third quarter results. 
However, in anticipation of incurring losses due to seasonal
fluctuations in the InfoSpherix business segment that occur in the first and
fourth quarters of the year, the Company, on July 22, 2005, entered into a
Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (“SEDA”) with Cornell Capital Partners,
L.P. (“Cornell”).  Under the SEDA,
Spherix can require Cornell to purchase up to $4,000,000 of the Company’s common
stock over a two-year period following the effective date, October 12, 2005, of
the registration covering the shares of our common stock to be sold to
Cornell.  The SEDA establishes what is
sometimes termed an “equity line of credit” or an “equity draw-down
facility.”  The $4,000,000 facility may
be drawn down upon by us in installments, the maximum amount of each draw down
is limited to $350,000.  For each share
of common stock purchased under the SEDA, Cornell will pay 95% of the lowest
volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of our shares during the five trading
days following our draw down notice to Cornell. 
The VWAP used in the calculation is that reported by Bloomberg, LLC, a
third-party reporting service.  In general,
the VWAP represents the sum of the value of all the sales of our common stock
for a given day (the total shares sold in each trade times the sales price per
share of the common stock for that trade), divided by the total number of our
shares sold on that day.  We are also
committed to pay to Cornell an amount equal to 5% of each purchase of our
common stock made by Cornell under the SEDA. 
Under the terms of the SEDA agreement, we are not obligated to draw down
on the SEDA facility, but once we satisfy normal conditions for this type of transaction,
we have the right to require Cornell to purchase our common shares under the
SEDA.  In connection with the SEDA, we
have issued to Cornell 95,000 shares of our common stock and paid a due
diligence fee of $5,000.  We also paid
Yorkville Advisors Management, LLC, the investment manager for Cornell, a
structuring fee of $15,000, and on each sale under the SEDA we will pay an
additional structuring fee of $500. 
Newbridge Securities Corporation acted as our placement agent for the
SEDA, and we paid that firm a fee of 5,000 shares of our common stock as
compensation valued at approximately $10,000. 
We also granted Newbridge Securities Corporation piggy-back registration
rights covering these shares.  Registration
of our common shares allocated to this facility was completed in October 2005.  During the term of the SEDA, our Officers and
Directors have agreed not to sell any of their shares of our common stock,
except to the extent permitted under Rule 144. 
The number of shares of our common stock issuable to Cornell under the
SEDA is subject to a 9.99% cap on the beneficial ownership that Cornell and its
affiliates may have at the time of each sale (beneficial ownership is to be
calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act).  Further, we may not issue more than 19.99% of
our currently outstanding shares under the SEDA unless shareholder approval is
received.  In 2006 and 2005, the Company
sold 819,453 and 310,076 shares under the SEDA agreement for total proceeds of
$1,896,500 and $376,500, respectively.

                On February 18,
2004, warrants for 500,000 shares of Common Stock were exercised at $6.91 per
share, compared to the then current market price of $6.76 per share, by an
institutional investor, and the expiration date of the remaining 585,973
warrants was extended until February 25, 2008, at an exercise price of $7.00
per share of common stock.  The remaining
warrants were assigned and transferred to another institutional investor in
2004.  On March 9, 2006, in exchange for
the Company’s agreement to reduce the exercise price to $2.04 per share, the
Investor agreed to exercise the warrants for the full 585,973 shares for total
proceeds of approximately $1.2 million. 
In connection with these warrants, the Investor agreed that it would not
exercise any of the warrants to the extent that it would acquire shares of
Common Stock exceeding 9.9% of the outstanding Common Stock, nor would it
knowingly sell shares to anyone to the extent that their holdings in the
Company would exceed 4.9% of the outstanding Common Stock.  The warrants and shares of Common Stock were
issued in transactions exempt from Registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act.  The Company has
registered the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants for resale by the
institutional Investor.
 
                At December 31,
2006, the Company’s shareholder’s equity was $14.6 million.
 
The Company has a share
repurchase program in place that initially authorized the purchase of up to
$1,000,000 of the Company’s shares in the open market.  To date, only 34,750 shares aggregating
$160,000 of the Company’s shares have been repurchased.  There was no repurchase activity during 2005
or 2006.

Item 7.           MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
Overview
 
                The Company operates via two principal segments,
BioSpherix and InfoSpherix.  BioSpherix
develops proprietary products for commercial applications.  InfoSpherix provides contact center
information and reservation services for government and industry.
 
                InfoSpherix generates substantially all of the
Company’s revenue.  In 2006, 2005, and
2004, InfoSpherix generated substantially all of its revenue from government
customers.  The Company has developed a
niche in providing campground and other reservation services via its
ReserveWorld business line, which accounted for approximately 64%, 62%, and 58%
of the Company’s revenue in 2006, 2005, and 2004.  During 2006, the Company won a reservation
contract for the State of Maine, and the re-compete of the contracts from the
States of Indiana and Minnesota.  The
Company’s National Park Service contract ended January 23, 2007.
 
                BioSpherix engages in product development, notably
tagatose.  The rights to manufacture
tagatose have been licensed to Arla along with the rights to sell tagatose for
food and beverage uses.  Our licensee has
not been successful in marketing tagatose for food and beverage uses and has
announced a cessation of further product manufacturing.  Accordingly, we have focused our efforts on
non-food use of tagatose, which we will market under the name “Naturlose”.  Our principal efforts have been to explore
whether Naturlose is an effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  We are about to commence a Phase 3 clinical
trial for this purpose.
 
Results of Operations¾2006
Compared with 2005
 
                In 2006, the
Company reported a net income of $3.5 million ($0.26 per diluted share) on
revenue of $24.8 million for the year, compared with a net loss of $2.8 million
($0.24 per diluted share) on revenue of $23 million in 2005.
 
Revenue
 
The Company experienced a
$1.8 million (8%) increase in revenue between years as a result of
InfoSpherix’s State of Pennsylvania campground reservation contract that was
awarded to the Company in 2005 and became operational at the beginning of 2006.

 
Direct Contract and Operating Costs
 
                Direct contract
and operating costs increased $431,000 (2%) between years with the addition of
the State of Pennsylvania contract.
 
Selling, General
and Administrative
 
                Selling, general and administrative expense
(“S,G&A”) for 2006 increased by $360,000 (7%) as the result of increased
legal costs relating to the Company’s challenge of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s award of the NRRS contract to another competitor, as noted above.
 
Research
and Development
 
                Research and
development costs increased $595,000 between years.  The Company is focusing its efforts on the
development of Naturlose as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  In 2006, the Company expended approximately
$780,000 in preparation for the Phase 3 clinical trial which is expected to
commence in April 2007.  The Phase 3
clinical trial is expected to take at least two (2) years to complete.  If the Phase 3 clinical trial is successful,
the Company will submit an appropriate drug application to the FDA.
15 


 
 
                The cost of
preparing for and conducting the Phase 3 trial has substantially increased as
the Company has increased the number of participants and the FDA requested a
change in the form of delivery of the drug to the participants.  The Company estimates that it could expend up
to $5 million in 2007 in furtherance of this trial.  Additional sums will be required to complete
the trial in 2008 and, if successful, to file and pursue the FDA application.
 
                The Company has
also outsourced to others preliminary testing of Naturlose to establish an
anti-plaque claim for toothpaste.  In
2005, the Company contracted with the University of Maryland School of
Dentistry to conduct human clinical trials on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of
Naturlose.  The study demonstrated
tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is
sorbitol, a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products.  The study suggested ways of modifying the
Naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction.  Such modifications have been made, and the
Company has negotiated with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to
conduct a trial of Naturlose toothpaste formulated by the Company in an attempt
to establish an anti-plaque claim for the toothpaste.  The clinical trial started in early 2007.
 
Other
Income
 
                In October 2006,
the Company agreed to a $6 million settlement to end its longstanding legal
dispute with the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the government’s award of
the National Recreation Reservation Service (NRRS) contract to ReserveAmerica,
a Ticketmaster subsidiary.  The Company’s
National Park Service contract ended January 23, 2007.  The National Park Service contract
contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005.
 
InfoSpherix Operations
 
                The following

commercial contracts (in $000s):

                As noted above,
InfoSpherix revenue for 2006 increased $1.8 million (8%) over that of the prior
year.  
 
During 2006, the
Company won a reservation contract from the State of Maine, and the re-compete
of the contracts from the States of Indiana and Minnesota.  The Company’s National Park Service contract
ended January 23, 2007.  The Company
operated the NPRS contract for nine years; revenue recognized was $4.0 million
for each of the years ended December 31, 2006, and 2005, or 16% and 17% of
total revenue for each year.  Park
reservation contracts during 2006 and 2005 made up over 60% of the Company’s
revenue and the Company is one of only two major suppliers of campground
reservation services in the U.S.
 
Starting October 1, 2005,
as part of the cost reduction efforts, the Maryland information center
contracts began operating exclusively in the Company’s Cumberland office
instead of the Beltsville office, and its margins for the fourth quarter of
2005 and for all of 2006 are now consistent with our other contracts.
 
                Currently, the
Company is bidding on several contracts and expects to bid on more contracts
throughout the coming year, although no assurance can be given at this time
that these efforts will result in new business for the Company.  
 
BioSpherix Operations
 
                BioSpherix is entitled to high end royalties from
Arla’s sales of tagatose until at least 2011, and, depending upon certain
conditions, until 2016.  The payments are
net of accumulated and continuing foreign patent maintenance costs.  Accumulated patent maintenance costs were
approximately $213,000 at year-end.  We
have earned minimal royalties from Arla in 2006, 2005, and 2004.  While tagatose has been introduced into
several food and beverage products, Arla currently has insufficient sales
volume and manufacturing capacity to produce tagatose at the rate necessary to
generate meaningful royalties.  At
present, Arla believes it has produced a sufficient backlog of inventory to
satisfy its needs for the foreseeable future based on current demand, and
accordingly has stopped production at its plant.  Spherix is also pursing the possibility of
other production options.
16 


 
 
                The Company is
focusing its efforts on the development of Naturlose as a treatment for Type 2
diabetes.  In 2006, the Company expended
approximately $780,000 in preparation for the Phase 3 clinical trial which is
expected to commence in April 2007.  The
Phase 3 clinical trial is expected to take at least two (2) years to
complete.  If the Phase 3 clinical trial
is successful, the Company will submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA.  Approval would allow the product to be sold
for its intended use to treat Type 2 diabetes. 
The Company would seek to partner with or license a major drug firm for
such commercialization.
 
                The cost of
preparing for and conducting the Phase 3 trial has substantially increased as
the FDA has provided more stringent parameters for the trial.  The Company estimates that it could expend up
to $5 million in 2007 in furtherance of this trial.  Additional sums will be required to complete
the trial in 2008 and, if successful, to file and pursue the FDA application.
 
                The Company has
also outsourced to others preliminary testing of Naturlose to establish an
anti-plaque claim for toothpaste. 
 
Sales Backlog
 
            The
Company’s funded and unfunded backlog as of December 31, 2006, was $57 million,
compared to $72 million as of December 31, 2005.  In 2006, the Company won a reservation
contract from the State of Maine, and the re-compete of the contracts from the
States of Indiana and Minnesota.  The NPS
contract ended in January 2007.
 
Results of Operations¾2005
Compared with 2004
 
                In 2005, the
Company reported a net loss of $2.8 million ($0.24 per diluted share) on
revenue of $23.0 million for the year, compared with a net loss of $2.8 million
($0.24 per diluted share) on revenue of $22.3 million in 2004.
 
Revenue
 
                Revenue
between years increased $697,000 (3%). 
Revenue from the InfoSpherix Division increased $802,000 (4%) and the
BioSpherix Division’s revenue decreased by $104,000 (82%).  The increased revenue from the InfoSpherix
Division was less than anticipated as a result of an unexpected temporary
funding shortage on one of our major Federal contracts that lasted for a period
of four months until the Federal Government’s fiscal year ended September 2005,
and from hurricanes and the rise in gasoline prices that impacted reservation
sales on our park reservation contracts during the third quarter of 2005.  The Division also saw a decrease in revenue
of approximately $2.9 million between years as a result of the decrease in
revenue under the new State of Maryland contract that started November 2004 and
the IRS contract that ended in April 2004. 
However, these set-backs were more than off-set by the division’s
continued overall growth from the award of new contracts.  The revenue growth was primarily driven by
contracts such as the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board that started
in May 2004, the Georgia contract that started in March 2004, and from
increases under existing contracts with the state of Ohio and the Office of
Personnel Management.  The decrease in
BioSpherix revenue was related to the discontinuance of the sale of FlyCracker
in 2004.
 
Direct Contract and Operating Costs
 
                Direct contract
and operating costs increased $863,000 (4%) between years.  This increase included the recognition of a
forward loss provision of $135,000 on one of the Company’s contracts.  The increase is also attributed to
approximately $100,000 in start-up costs related to the new State of
Pennsylvania contract that began in January 2006.  South Dakota operations operated at a
break-even for 2005, up $100,000 from 2004.
 
Selling, General
and Administrative
 
                Selling, general and administrative expense
(“S,G&A”) for 2005 decreased by $217,000 (4%) from that of the prior
year.  In 2005, the Company cut its
consulting costs by approximately $265,000, most of which were related to
marketing.
17 


 
Research
and Development
 
                Research and
development costs increased $92,000 between years.  In 2004, the BioSpherix Division began a
program of outsourcing development of its patented drug uses of Naturlose.  A research project was funded at the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine to follow up on that institution’s discovery that
Naturlose may lengthen shelf life of stored blood fractions and medicinal
proteins.  In 2005, the Company
contracted with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct human
clinical trials on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose.  The study demonstrated tagatose to be much
more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is sorbitol, a sugar
substitute that is widely used in oral care products.  Contrary to earlier laboratory findings by
Spherix, however, a human study at the University of Maryland School of
Dentistry did not show anti-plaque activity. 
Conditions in the mouth may have prevented the desired effect, according
to the University researchers.  Spherix
is following up on corrective suggestions made by the University, and plans to
conduct new human trials.

                As noted above,
InfoSpherix revenue for 2005 increased $802,000 (4%) over that of the prior
year.  The increased revenue from the
InfoSpherix Division was less than anticipated as a result of an unexpected
temporary funding shortage on one of our major Federal contracts that lasted
for a period of four months until the Federal Government’s fiscal year ended
September 2005, and from hurricanes and the rise in gasoline prices that
impacted reservation sales on our park reservation contracts during the third
quarter of 2005.  The Division also saw a
decrease in revenue of approximately $2.9 million between years from the
decrease in revenue under the new State of Maryland contract that started
November 2004, and the IRS contract that ended in April 2004.  However, these set-backs were more than off-set
by the division’s continued overall growth. 
This revenue growth was primarily driven by contracts such as the
Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board that started in May 2004, Georgia
that started in March 2004, and from increases under existing contracts such as
Ohio and the Office of Personnel Management. 
The fourth quarter in particular saw a significant improvement over the
prior year, with an increase in revenue of $399,000 as a result of increased revenue
in the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board contract and a general growth
across the board on our existing reservation contracts.  This combined with a reduction in direct
costs of $139,000 between the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, contributed to
the $472,000 improvement in operations between quarters.
 
In 2005, Spherix won park
reservation contracts for Orange County, California, the State of Pennsylvania,
and the State of Michigan.  The Orange
County contract consists of three base years and is valued at less than half a
million.  The State of Pennsylvania
contract is a five-year contract, consisting of one base year and four option
years, valued at approximately $8 million. 
The State of Michigan contract is a continuation of our current contract
with the State.  The new contract is for
five years, and consists of three base years plus two option years, valued at
approximately $14 million.
 
                In March 2004, the
Company won a one-year, multi-million dollar Federal Retirement Thrift
Investment Board (“FRTIB”) contract with four option years.  Also, on March 1, 2004, the Company purchased
certain assets of Daksoft, Inc. related to its reservation business, which
operates under the name “ReserveIt.”  The
purchase included the acquisition of six additional government reservation
contracts and the intellectual property rights to the name “ReserveIt,” as well
as other assets of the division.  Spherix
purchased the assets for $700,000 plus 43,029 shares of the Company’s common
stock, then trading at $6.699 per share.
 
                In 2004, the
Company won the re-procurement of the Maryland information center contracts,
which the company has operated since 1998. 
The new contracts are for three years plus two additional option
years.  The combined Maryland contracts
contributed 12% to the Company’s revenue in 2005 and 22% in 2004.  The new contract started on November 1, 2004,
and is subject to a more competitive pricing structure, which was necessary to
win the re-compete.  While Spherix was
not the lowest bidder, the Company’s higher technical scoring resulted in the
Company achieving an overall higher score than the competition.  Management is uncertain as to the long-term
financial impact the price reduction will have over the course of the contract
and believes that the lower rates may encourage the state to outsource more of
its call center needs to Spherix under this contract.  The previous contract initially operated at a
loss 
18 


 
during its first year and had matured to a respectable contribution
margin by the time the contract ended in late 2004.  This increase was gained through the
continued outsourcing of more of the state’s call center needs to Spherix under
the contract.  The new contract, which
was bid at a lower contribution margin, is the principal cause for the decrease
in operating income between years. 
Starting October 1, 2005, as part of the cost reduction efforts, the
Maryland contract began operating exclusively out of the Company’s Cumberland
office instead of the Beltsville office, and its margins for the fourth quarter
were now consistent with our other contracts.
 
                Revenue from
commercial contracts decreased between years. 
Commercial contracts are typically for shorter terms than government
contracts and that can result in substantial variations in commercial revenue.  Commercial contracts are being pursued by the
Company, but the Company’s recent history has been that contracts have been
received on a sporadic basis.
 
BioSpherix Operations
 
                The
$104,000 decrease in the BioSpherix revenue from $127,000 to $23,000 between
years was related to the discontinuance of the sale of FlyCracker in 2004.  
 
Sales Backlog
 
                The Company’s
funded and unfunded backlog as of December 31, 2005, was $72 million, compared
to $61 million as of December 31, 2004. 
In 2005, the Company won five-year contracts with the States of
Pennsylvania and Michigan. 
 
Critical Accounting Estimates
 
                The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and revenue and expenses for the period reported.  Estimates are based upon historical
experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances.  These estimates
are evaluated periodically and form the basis for making judgments regarding
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of
revenue and expenses.  Actual results may
differ substantially from these estimates.
 
                Spherix’s critical
accounting policies are those it believes are the most important in determining
its financial condition and results, and require significant subjective
judgment by management as a result of inherent uncertainties.  A summary of the Company’s significant
accounting policies is set out in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements.  Such policies are discussed
below.
 
Accounting for Taxes and
Valuation Allowances
 
                We currently have
significant deferred tax assets, resulting from net operating loss carry
forwards.  These deferred tax assets may
reduce taxable income in future periods. 
Based on the Company’s losses and its accumulated deficit, the Company
has provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax
asset.  A valuation allowance is required
when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will
not be realized.  Cumulative losses weigh
heavily in the overall assessment of valuation allowances. 
 
                We expect to
continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an
appropriate level of profitability is sustained, or we are able to develop tax
strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not
that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable. 
 
Long-Lived Assets and Other
Intangible Assets
 
                Long-lived assets
and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever the carrying
amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized
when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset’s use and eventual
disposition.

New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2006, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No.
48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN48”).  The Interpretation clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial
statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes.”  We are required to adopt FIN 48
effective January 1, 2007.  We are
currently evaluating the impact this interpretation will have on our financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows.
In September 2006,
the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair
Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).  SFAS
157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  We are required to adopt SFAS 157 effective
January 1, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material
affect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In September 2006,
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 108 (“SAB 108”).  SAB 108
addresses diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement
misstatements and the potential under current practice for the build up of
improper amounts on the balance sheet. 
The bulletin requires companies to quantify misstatements based on their
impact on each of their financial statements and related disclosures.  We have adopted SAB 108 in connection with
the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2006.  The adoption of SAB 108 did not
have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
On March 31, 2006,
the Company entered into a new agreement with Bank of America (“the Bank”) to
establish a line-of-credit (“New Agreement”) for its subsidiary, InfoSpherix
Incorporated, with the outstanding borrowings under the old line of credit
transferred to the new agreement. 
Management considers the establishment of this credit facility for the
subsidiary necessary to ensure timely cash flow for the subsidiary’s
operations.  The New Agreement, which
matures June 30, 2008, provides for borrowings up to $1.5 million, is
collateralized by the subsidiary’s accounts receivables and equipment, and
contains covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios.  Such covenants could have a limiting effect
on the amount of cash that the subsidiary can advance to Spherix.  The interest rate under the Agreement is
based on the LIBOR daily floating rate plus 3% (approximately 8.34% at December
31, 2006).  The Company had no
outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at December 31, 2006, and the total
amount available for future advance to the subsidiary was $1.5 million under
the Agreement.
Working capital as
of December 31, 2006, was $10.9 million, which represents a $7.8 million
increase from working capital of $3.1 million at December 31, 2005.  The increase in working capital between years
was largely related to the U.S. Department of Agriculture settlement.
Spherix expects to
expend up to $5 million over the next year in costs related to the Phase 3
clinical trial.
InfoSpherix
Incorporated intends to finance its furniture and equipment needs through
financing or leasing arrangements where practicable, including those related to
the start-up costs of new contracts the Company may win.
Cash flow for the
year ended December 31, 2006, reflects a net cash inflow of $8.3 million,
consisting of $6.7 million provided by operating activities, $586,000 provided
by investing activities, and $1 million provided by financing activities.  The increase in cash provided by operating
activities in 2006 from that of the prior year was primarily due to $6 million
settlement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the award of the NRRS
contract.  The increase in cash provided
by investing activities was directly related to the expiration of restrictions
on cash that was used as collateral on the Company’s line-of-credit in prior
years, and the increase in cash provided by financing activities was the result
of proceeds raised from the issuance of stock under the SEDA agreement and the
exercise of warrants.

Trends
and Outlooks
InfoSpherix
·                  The
Company’s National Park Service contract ended January 23, 2007.  The National Park Service contract
contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005.
·                  In
2006, the Company won the re-compete on its park reservation services to the
States of Indiana and Minnesota and recently won a new state park reservation
contract for the State of Maine and will be a subcontractor on another
contract.
·                  Since
1998, InfoSpherix has grown its government park reservation business from one
contract to 17 government reservation contracts.  InfoSpherix’s reservation business accounted
for over 60% of the Company’s revenue in 2006 and 2005.  InfoSpherix is now one of only two major
suppliers of Government campground reservation services in the U.S.
·                  On
February 6, 2007, the Company signed an agreement to lease 32,423 square feet
of facility space in Frostburg, Maryland effective December 1, 2007, for use as
a call center to replace the existing Cumberland, Maryland facility.
BioSpherix
·                  BioSpherix’s
primary emphasis is on a Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate that Naturlose
is a successful treatment for Type 2 diabetes.
·                  Costs
of conducting the Phase 3 trial have substantially increased as we have obtained
further direction from the FDA concerning the processes to be employed in the
trial.  The Company is exploring all of
its alternatives to generate sufficient funds to complete the Phase 3 trial, to
further develop Naturlose as a diabetes treatment if the Phase 3 trial is
successful, and to further commercialize Naturlose for other uses.
Contractual
Obligations
The following
table summarizes the Company’s known contractual obligations at December 31,
2006, and indicates the year payments are due. 
In some cases estimates have been used where the exact amount and/or
timing of the obligation is not presently known.  The table does not include ordinary accounts
payable and payroll type obligations and does not include estimates for future
interest obligation payments under the Company’s bank line of credit noted
above in the Liquidity and Capital Resources sections.

Item 7A.                 QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Company
manages its debt and its available cash by considering available investment
opportunities, risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies.
At December 31,
2006, the Company did not have any fixed-rate or variable-rate
indebtedness.  The Company has not
entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its
indebtedness.
Cash available for
investment is typically invested in short term funds, which generally mature in
30 days, or money-market funds.  In
general, such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on
such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.  The carrying amounts approximate market
value.  It is the Company’s practice to
hold these investments to maturity.
Assuming year-end
2006 variable rate debt and cash available for investment, a one percent change
in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than $100,000.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Spherix Incorporated
We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Spherix Incorporated (a Delaware
corporation) and subsidiary (the Company) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2006.   These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required
to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting.  Our audits included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. 
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 1 to
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted SFAS No.
123R, “Share-Based Payment,” effective January
1, 2006.

Spherix Incorporated
Notes to Financial Statements
1.             Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Nature of Business
On January 1,
2006, Spherix Incorporated transferred the assets of its information services
segment (the “InfoSpherix Division”) to a new wholly-owned subsidiary,
InfoSpherix Incorporated (“InfoSpherix”). 
Spherix Incorporated (“Spherix”) was founded in 1967, and both Companies
are incorporated in Delaware.  The
activities of the biotechnology segment (“BioSpherix”) continue to operate
through Spherix Incorporated.  BioSpherix
is dedicated to research, development, and productization of proprietary
products.  InfoSpherix operates contact
center services providing consulting, information management, and materials
management to the public as well as reservation and tourism solutions.  These services are provided primarily under
government contracts.  The Company
maintains three facilities in Maryland, including its corporate headquarters in
Beltsville, and one facility in Indiana.
Basis of Presentation
Beginning January
1, 2006, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of both
Spherix Incorporated and InfoSpherix Incorporated (collectively, the “Company”).  All intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  This requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the period.  Accordingly, actual results
could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Cash
Equivalents
The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. 
At December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately $6.5 million
invested in treasury funds with a maturity of three months or less, which are
included as cash and cash equivalents. 
The Company maintains cash balances at several banks.  Accounts at each institution are insured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $100,000.  At December 31, 2006, the Company’s cash and
cash equivalent in excess of the FDIC limits was $10,751,000.
Concentrations
During 2006,
revenue from three major government contracts accounted for 16%, 15%, and 11%
of the Company’s total revenue.  No other
contracts were greater than 10%.  At
December 31, 2006, four major contracts constituted 68% of the trade accounts
receivable, the components of which were 26%, 16%, 15% and 11%.  No other single contract was greater than 10%
of total trade accounts receivable. 
Receivables from Federal and state government agencies represented 83%
of the total trade accounts receivable.
During 2005,
revenue from four major government contracts accounted for 17%, 16%, 12%, and
12% of the Company’s total revenue.  No
other contracts were greater than 10%. 
At December 31, 2005, four major contracts constituted 75% of the trade
accounts receivable, the components of which were 30%, 16%, 15% and 14%.  No other single contract was greater than 10%
of total trade accounts receivable. 
Receivables from Federal and state government agencies represented 91%
of the total trade accounts receivable. 
Government contracts accounted for approximately 99%, 100%, and 99% of
the InfoSpherix revenue in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
Property
and Equipment and Depreciation
Property and
equipment are stated at cost and consist of office furniture and equipment,
computer hardware and software, leasehold improvements, and capital
leases.  Computer hardware and software
include the cost of internally developed software programs, which have
long-term benefits.  The Company has
developed and continues to develop a large variety of software applications
that are used in the performance of its multiple contact center and park
reservation contracts.  These
applications are designed to aid our telephone operators in providing
information to the public as well as collecting caller information.  The Company has also developed software
applications that we use to
28 


process park reservation
transactions.  The Company capitalizes
the labor and fringe costs incurred by our software programmers in the
development of these applications as well as the costs incurred in creating
functionality enhancements.  In 2006 and
2005, the Company capitalized approximately $790,000 and $804,000 in internally
developed software, respectively.  The
Company computes depreciation and amortization under the straight-line method
and typically over the following estimated useful lives of the related assets:




Office furniture and
  equipment


 


3
  to 10 years


 




Computer hardware and
  software


 


3 to 5 years


 




 
Leasehold
improvements are depreciated or amortized over the lesser of the term of the
related lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally 5 to 10
years).  Major additions, improvements
and renewals are capitalized and ordinary repairs, maintenance, and renewals
are expensed in the year incurred.  Gains
or losses from the sale or retirement of property and equipment result from the
difference between sales proceeds (if any) and the assets’ net book value, and
are recorded in the consolidated Statement of Operations.
Inventory
Included in
prepaid expenses at December 31, 2006, is approximately $65,000 of Naturlose
inventory.  The inventory is valued at
lower of cost or market.
Deferred
Rent
The Company
entered into leases for its Beltsville, Cumberland, Annapolis and Indianapolis
facilities in 1997, 2003, 2004, and 2006, respectively.  The excess of the rent expense over the cash
payments for rent is recorded as deferred rent and is being amortized over the
life of the leases.
Research and Development Costs
Research
and development costs are charged to operations as incurred.
Patent
Costs
Legal costs
incurred in connection with patent applications and costs of acquiring patents
are capitalized when incurred.  When
patents are granted, costs are amortized over a term representing the lesser of
the life of the patent or the projected sales period of the product or process.
Revenue
Recognition
Revenue is
recognized using the following methods depending upon the terms of the
contracts:  time and materials or fixed
price.  Revenue under time and materials
contracts is recognized at contractually agreed-upon rates based upon direct
labor hours expended and other direct costs incurred.  Revenue for fixed-price contracts is
recognized using unit-of-delivery methods. 
Losses, if any, on contracts are recorded during the period when first
determined.
Direct
Contract and Operating Costs
The Company’s
direct contract and operating costs consist primarily of labor and fringe costs
for contact center personnel, subcontractors, telephone related costs,
depreciation on computer hardware and software and related facilities costs.
Selling,
General and Administrative Expense
The Company’s
selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive
management salaries and fringes, sales and marketing costs, finance and
accounting, human resources, as well as general corporate costs and costs related
to being a public company.
Income
Taxes
Deferred income
taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts at each year end, based on enacted tax laws and
29 


statutory tax rates
applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect
taxable income.  A valuation allowance is
established based upon periodic assessments made by management to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  Income tax expense is the tax payable for the
period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Fair
Value Information
The estimated fair
value of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash, receivables,
accounts payable, and bank line of credit reported in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, approximate their carrying value given their short maturities.
Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation
Effective January
1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123(R) “Share-Based Payment” (FAS 123R), which requires the measurement of all
employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, using a fair-value based method and the recording of such expense in
the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  The Company uses a Black-Scholes option
pricing model and has elected to use the modified prospective transition method
and, therefore, has not restated results for prior periods.  At the time the Company adopted FAS 123R,
there were no unvested options outstanding. 
For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company realized $24,000 in
stock based compensation expense relating to 59,000 stock options awarded in February
2006.  The effect of adopting FAS 123R
increased the loss from operations, and decreased the income before taxes and
the net income by $24,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, and had no
effect on basic and diluted earnings per share, net cash flow from operations,
or net cash flow from financing activities.
For the years
prior to January 1, 2006, the Company elected the “disclosure only”
presentation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 “Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation” (FAS 123) and, consequently, did not record
compensation expense relating to employee option grants provided the exercise
prices were at or above fair value of the Company’s common stock on the grant
date.
On November 4,
2005, the Company had a total of 176,658 previously unvested stock options
outstanding.  The exercise prices of all
of these options were greater than the fair value of the Company’s stock.  On this day, the Board of Directors voted to
fully vest all of the then outstanding stock options.  The average weighted exercise price of these
options was $7.98.  The primary purpose
of the accelerated vesting was to enable the Company to avoid recognizing the
future compensation expense for these options upon adoption of “SFAS 123R.”  The related future stock-based employee
compensation expense that was eliminated as a result of the acceleration of the
vesting of these options is approximately $562,000, and had the effect of
increasing the 2005 proforma loss from $3,110,977 to $3,672,738 and the
proforma loss per share from $(0.26) to $(0.31).
To measure
stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123, the fair value of each
option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model.  The following
table summarizes the pro-forma net loss and net loss per share resulting from
applying SFAS 123.
The following

                Net income (Loss) Per Share
Basic net income
(loss) per common share has been computed by dividing net income (loss) by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year.  Diluted net income per common share is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding with an assumed increase in common shares outstanding for common
stock equivalents.  At December 31, 2006,
the Company had outstanding 501,100 options, none of which were assumed likely
to be exercised.  Diluted net loss per
common share has been computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding without an assumed increase in common
shares outstanding for common stock equivalents, as common stock equivalents
are antidilutive.

New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2006, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No.
48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN48”).  The Interpretation clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial
statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes.”  We are required to adopt FIN 48
effective January 1, 2007.   We are
currently evaluating the impact this interpretation will have on our financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows.
In September 2006,
the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair
Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).  SFAS
157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. 
We are required to adopt SFAS 157 effective January 1, 2008. We do not
expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material affect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
In September 2006,
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 108 (“SAB 108”).  SAB 108
addresses diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement
misstatements and the potential under current practice for the build up of
improper amounts on the balance sheet. 
The bulletin requires companies to quantify misstatements based on the
impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.  We have adopted SAB 108 in connection with
the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2006.  The adoption of SAB 108 did not
have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.
2.             Restricted Investments
At December 31, 2005, the Company held $2,000,000 in
a restricted certificate of deposit as collateral on the Company’s bank line of
credit.  The Company was released from
the bank line of credit restriction when the line of credit matured on March
31, 2006, (see Note 6 “Line of Credit”). 
The certificate of deposit matured on June 30, 2006.  A restricted certificate of deposit is not
required as collateral on the new line of credit.
3.             Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Management regularly
reviews the accounts receivables for uncollectible and potentially
uncollectible accounts and when necessary establishes an allowance for doubtful
accounts.

5.             Intangible Assets
On March 1, 2004,
the Company purchased certain assets of Daksoft, Inc. related to its
reservation business, which operates under the name “ReserveIt.”  The purchase included the acquisition of six
additional government reservation contracts and the intellectual property
rights to the name “ReserveIt,” as well as other assets of the division.  Spherix purchased the assets for $700,000
plus the issuance of 43,029 shares of common stock valued at $288,000 (subject
to certain restrictions).  The Company
assessed the value of the purchased contracts to be $976,000 and will amortize
it annually over seven years, the estimated contractual life.  In 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company
recognized $139,000, $139,000, and $116,000, respectively, in related
amortization expense.
The Company’s
total amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and
2004 was $167,000, $161,000, and $140,000, respectively.  The Company’s future amortization over the
next five years based on its intangible assets at December 31, 2006, 2005, and
2004 are as follows:

6.             Debt
Line
of Credit
As a result of the
creation of InfoSpherix as a wholly-owned subsidiary, management no longer
considers maintaining a bank line of credit for the parent company, Spherix,
necessary, and, therefore decided not to renew the old credit agreement when it
matured on March 31, 2006.  The Company
entered into a new agreement on March 31, 2006 with Bank of America (“the Bank”)
to establish a line-of-credit (“New Agreement”) for its subsidiary, InfoSpherix
Incorporated, with the outstanding borrowings of approximately $1.5 million
under the old line of credit transferred to the new agreement.  Management considers the establishment of
this credit facility for the subsidiary necessary to ensure timely cash flow
for the subsidiary’s operations.  The New
Agreement, which matures June 30, 2008, provides for borrowings up to $1.5
million, is collateralized by the subsidiary’s accounts receivables and
equipment, and contains covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to
EBITDA ratios.  Such covenants could have
a limiting effect on the amount of cash that the subsidiary can advance to
Spherix.  The interest rate under the
Agreement is based on the LIBOR daily floating rate plus 3% (approximately
8.34% at December 31, 2006).  The Company
had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at December 31, 2006, and the
total amount available for future advance to the subsidiary was $1.5 million
under the Agreement.

8.             Stockholder Equity
Private Placements
The Company
determined that, as of June 30, 2005, it was approximately $454,000 short of
meeting NASDAQ’s Global Market listing requirement of maintaining a minimum of
$10,000,000 in shareholders’ equity. 
NASDAQ gave the Company until September 1, 2005, to correct this
situation, which the Company achieved through its third quarter results.  However, in anticipation of incurring losses
due to seasonal fluctuations in the InfoSpherix business segment that occur in
the first and fourth quarters of the year, the Company entered into a Standby
Equity Distribution Agreement (“SEDA”) with Cornell Capital Partners, L.P. (“Cornell”)
on July 22, 2005.  Under the SEDA,
Spherix can require Cornell to purchase up to $4,000,000 of the Company’s
common stock over a two-year period following the effective date, October 12,
2005, of the registration covering the shares of our common stock to be sold to
Cornell.  The SEDA establishes what is
sometimes termed an “equity line of credit” or an “equity draw-down facility.”  The $4,000,000 facility may be drawn down
upon by us in installments, the maximum amount of each draw down is limited to
$350,000.  For each share of common stock
purchased under the SEDA, Cornell will pay 95% of the lowest volume weighted
average price (“VWAP”) of the Company’s shares during the five trading days
following the Company’s draw down notice to Cornell.  The VWAP used in the calculation is that
reported by Bloomberg, LLC, a third-party reporting service.  In general, the VWAP represents the sum of
the value of all the sales of our common stock for a given day (the total
shares sold in each trade times the sales price per share of the common stock
for that trade), divided by the total number of our shares sold on that
day.  The Company is also committed to
pay to Cornell an amount equal to 5% of each purchase of common stock made by
Cornell under the SEDA.  Under the terms
of the SEDA agreement, the Company is not obligated to draw down on the SEDA
facility, but once we satisfy normal conditions for this type of transaction,
we have the right to require Cornell to purchase our common stock.  In connection with the SEDA, we have issued
to Cornell 95,000 shares of our common stock and paid a due diligence fee of
$5,000.  We also paid Yorkville Advisors
Management, LLC, the investment manager for Cornell, a structuring fee of
$15,000, and on each sale under the SEDA we will pay an additional structuring
fee of $500.  Newbridge Securities
Corporation acted as our placement agent for the SEDA, and we paid that firm a
fee of 5,000 shares of our common stock valued at $10,000.  We also granted Newbridge Securities
Corporation piggy-back registration rights covering these shares.  Registration of our common shares covered
under the SEDA was completed in October 2005. 
During the term of the SEDA, our Officers and Directors have agreed not
to sell any of their shares of our common stock, except to the extent permitted
under Rule 144.  The number of shares of
our common stock issuable to Cornell under the SEDA is subject to a 9.99% cap
on the beneficial ownership that Cornell and its affiliates may have at the
time of each installment (beneficial ownership is to be calculated in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act).  Further, the Company may not issue more than
19.99% of our currently outstanding shares under the SEDA unless shareholder
approval is received.  Fees paid through
cash and common stock to Cornell, Yorkville Advisors, and Newbridge Security
totaling $220,000 were charged against the proceeds of the initial draw on the
facility.  In 2006, the Company sold
819,453 shares under the SEDA agreement for total proceeds of $1,897,000, and
in 2005, the Company sold 310,076 shares under the SEDA agreement for total
proceeds of $376,000.  At December 31,
2006, the Company’s shareholder’s equity was $14.6 million.
On March 9, 2006,
in exchange for the Company’s agreement to reduce the exercise price of 585,973
in outstanding warrants to $2.04 per share, an Investor agreed to exercise the
full 585,973 shares for total proceeds of approximately $1.2 million.  In connection with these warrants, the new
holder of the warrants agreed that it would not exercise any of the warrants to
the extent that it would acquire shares of Common Stock exceeding 9.9% of the
outstanding Common Stock, nor would it knowingly sell shares to anyone to the
extent that their holdings in the
33 


Company would exceed 4.9%
of the outstanding Common Stock.  The
warrants and shares of Common Stock were issued in transactions exempt from
Registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.  The Company has registered the shares
issuable upon exercise of the warrants for resale by the institutional
investor.
Stock
Option Plan
The Company has an
Employees’ Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”) which permits issuance of both
Incentive Stock Options (ISO) and Non-Qualified Stock Options, whereby options
may be granted to officers and Directors and other key employees to purchase up
to 1,000,000 shares of common stock in amounts determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors through December 31, 2007.  During 2006, 2005, and 2004, 59,000, 12,500,
and 60,000 options were granted under the Plan, respectively.  At December 31, 2006, 403,100 options were
available for grant under the Plan.
On November 4,
2005, the Company had a total of 176,658 previously unvested stock options
outstanding.  The exercise prices of all
of these options were greater than the fair value of the Company’s stock.  The Board of Directors approved the
acceleration of vesting of all such outstanding stock options.  The average weighted exercise price of these
options was $7.98.  The primary purpose
of the accelerated vesting was to enable the Company to avoid recognizing the
future compensation expense for these options upon adoption of “SFAS 123R.”  The estimated stock-based employee
compensation expense that was eliminated as a result of this action was
approximately $562,000, and had the effect of increasing the 2005 proforma loss
from $3,110,977 to $3,672,738 and the proforma loss per share from $(0.24) to
$(0.31).

9.             Income Taxes
Income tax expense
for 2006 was $105,000 and is attributed to the alternative minimum tax.  There was no income tax expense for the years
2005 and 2004 as a result of net losses and the net operating loss
carryforwards and increases in the valuation allowance.
The tax effect of
significant temporary differences representing deferred tax assets as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, is as follows:

Approximately $4.1
million in U.S. tax net operating losses were utilized in 2006.  The Company has $14.6 million in net
operating loss carryforwards that will be available to offset regular taxable
U.S. income during the carryforward period, which will expire from 2019 through
2025.  Based on the Company’s historical
losses and its accumulated deficit, the Company has provided a full valuation
allowance against the net deferred tax asset. 
At
35 


December 31, 2006,
approximately $388,000 of the valuation allowance, related to benefits from
stock compensation, will be credited to “paid in capital” when recognized in
future periods.

Party Transactions
Employment,
Deferred Compensation, and Consulting Agreements for Principal Stockholders
Dr. Gilbert V.
Levin, Company founder and former CEO, has served under an Employment Agreement
since March 3, 1969.  This Agreement
was amended and restated in 2004, and continued through December 31, 2004.  On February 17, 1993, the Company entered
into agreements with Dr. Levin and Mrs. M. Karen Levin to provide adequate
retirement benefits and to protect the Company’s stock from a precipitous sale
to pay estate taxes upon their deaths. 
These agreements provided that, upon retirement, under a Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), these individuals would receive deferred
compensation equal to 70% and 60%, respectively, of their average annual total
compensation less the assumed returns from investment of their funded pension
plans, and less their social security payments. 
On March 23, 2004, after lengthy consideration and consultation, the
Board and the Levins approved new deferred compensation agreements.  At March 23, 2004, the deferred compensation
plan for Dr. Levin was unfunded and the Company had no liability under the
plan.  In the March 23, 2004 agreement,
Dr. Levin voluntarily forgave the Company of its obligations under his SERP
agreement.  The Company also has agreed
to provide Dr. Levin with lifetime payments of $12,500 each quarter and to fund
long-term lifetime healthcare and health insurance policies following his full
retirement from the Company.  In 2004,
Dr. and Mrs. Levin voluntarily forgave the Company its obligation to retain key
man life insurance on them and to buy back stock from the last to survive.  On November 29, 2005, the Board and Mrs.
Levin approved a new agreement concerning her retirement benefits in connection
with her January 4, 2006 retirement from the Company.  At November 29, 2005, the deferred
compensation plan for Mrs. Levin was unfunded and the Company had no liability
under the plan as actuarially determined. 
In the November 29, 2005 agreement, Mrs. Levin voluntarily forgave the
Company its obligations under her SERP agreement.  The Company also has agreed to provide Mrs.
Levin lifetime payments of $12,500 each quarter and to fund long-term lifetime
healthcare and health insurance policies following her January 4, 2006,
retirement from the Company.  At December
31, 2006, the Company’s liability for both Dr. Levin and Mrs. Levin was
estimated to be $389,000 for the lifetime payments and $156,000 for funding the
long-term lifetime healthcare and health insurance policies.  The non-current portion of these amounts is
reported on the accompanying balance sheet as deferred compensation.
Upon completion of
their employment, the officer-stockholders agree to serve as consultants to the
Company on an as-needed basis, at a specified daily rate.

In July 2005,
Spherix filed an official protest of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s award
of the National Recreation Reservation System (“NRRS”) contract to
ReserveAmerica, a TicketMaster subsidiary. 
The NRRS will provide reservation services for all Federal recreation
facilities, including the National Park sites serviced by Spherix under its
National Park Reservation Service (“NPRS”) contract with the Department of
Interior.  On October 20, 2005, the Government
Accountability Office (“GAO”) sustained Spherix’s challenge to the USDA Forest
Service award and recommended that the Department of Agriculture reopen the
competition and make a new award decision. 
This was the second time that GAO found the Forest Service’s attempt to
award the NRRS contract to ReserveAmerica to be flawed.  In October 2006, the Company agreed to a $6
million settlement to end its longstanding legal dispute with the U.S.
Department of Agriculture over the government’s award of the National
Recreation Reservation Service (NRRS) contract to ReserveAmerica, a
Ticketmaster subsidiary.  The Company’s
NPRS contract concluded on January 23, 2007. 
The Company operated the NPRS contract for nine years; revenue
recognized was $4.0 million, $4.0 million and $3.9 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, or 16%, 17% and 17% of total
revenue for each year.
11.          Employee Benefit Plans
Effective January
1, 1990, the Company established the Spherix Incorporated 401(k) Retirement
Plan.  The Plan is a discretionary
defined contribution plan and covers substantially all employees who have
attained the age of 21, have completed one year of service, and have worked a
minimum of 1,000 hours in the past Plan or anniversary year.
Under provisions
of the Plan, the Company, for any plan year, has contributed an amount equal to
50% of the participant’s contribution or 2½% of the participant’s eligible
compensation, whichever is less.  The
Company may, at
37 


its own discretion, make additional
matching contributions to participants. 
Company contributions, net of forfeitures, amounted to $122,000,
$113,000, and $105,000 in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
12.          Employee Stock Purchase Plan
On May 15, 2003, the Company approved an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
whereby the employees could purchase shares of the Company’s stock.  Under the Plan, the Company was authorized to
initially issue up to 500,000 shares of common stock, with additional amounts
determined annually based upon other provisions of the Plan.  The Plan became available to the employees on
January 1, 2004.  In 2005 and 2004, 6,985
and 1,796 shares were issued under the plan, respectively.  The Board of Directors voted to discontinue
the plan effective June 30, 2005.
13.          Information by Business Segment
Operating segments
are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or
decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance.  The Company is managed
along two business segments, InfoSpherix and BioSpherix.
                Financial information by business segment for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 is summarized below:

During 2006,
InfoSpherix recognized revenue from three of its customers, all of which were
government agencies, representing 16%, 15% and 11% of the total Company
revenue.  During 2005, InfoSpherix
recognized revenue from four of its customers, all of which were government
agencies, representing 17%, 16%, 12% and 12% of
38 


the total Company
revenue.  During 2004, InfoSpherix
recognized revenue from three of its customers, all of which were government
agencies, representing 21%, 17%, and 13% of the total Company revenue.  Government contracts accounted for
approximately 99%, 100%, and 99% of the InfoSpherix revenue in 2006, 2005, and
2004, respectively.
BioSpherix has
invented and patented for the Company the use of tagatose as a low-calorie
sweetener.  In 1996, the Company signed
an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with Arla Foods Ingredients amba of
Denmark (formerly MD Foods Ingredients) for the use and sale of Spherix’s
low-calorie sugar, tagatose, as a sweetener in foods and beverages (see Note 10 “Commitments and Contingencies”).  The License Agreement and an amendment thereto
provide Arla the world-wide right to manufacture and sell tagatose for food
uses, and the right to manufacture tagatose for all uses.  In 2000, MDFI was merged into Arla Foods.
Operating loss
consists of revenue less operating expenses. 
In computing operating profit, interest expense and income taxes were
not considered.  Operating loss for
InfoSpherix was 8% and 9% of InfoSpherix revenue for 2005 and 2004.
Identifiable
assets by business segment are those assets used in the Company’s operations in
each segment, such as accounts receivable, inventories, fixed assets, and
patent costs.  Corporate assets are
principally cash and certain other assets not related to a particular segment’s
operations.

Item 9.           CHANGES IN AND
DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
Item 9A.                 CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures.  We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports, such as this report on Form 10-K,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. These controls and procedures are based closely
on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in
Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.  Rules adopted by
the SEC require that we present the conclusions of the Chief Executive
Officer/Chief Financial Officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report.
Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls.  Management, including
our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud.  In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives.  Further, the design of a control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management necessarily
was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
of possible controls and procedures.  Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
Company have been detected.  These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
mistake.  Additionally, controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management’s override of the control.  The design of any system of controls also is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.  Because
of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Periodic
Evaluation and Conclusion.   The Company carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management,
including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance
level.  There were no significant changes
in internal controls during the latest quarter over financial reporting that
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal
controls over financial reporting.
Item 9B.                 OTHER INFORMATION
There was no
information required to be disclosed on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of
2006, which was not so disclosed.

Compliance with Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act
Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Regarding Compliance
Section 16(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), requires
the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers, and anyone who beneficially
owns ten percent (10%) or more of the Company’s common stock, to file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of beneficial ownership and
reports of changes in beneficial ownership of common stock.  Such persons are required by regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission to furnish the Company with copies of
all Section 16(a) forms they file.
43 


 
Based solely upon
a review of (i) copies of the Section 16(a) filings received by the Company
during or with respect to 2006 and (ii) certain written representations of its
Officers and Directors, the Company believes that each filing required to be
made pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during and with respect to
2006 was filed in a timely manner except for the Form 4’s filed April 7, 2006,
related to stock options issued to the independent Board Members, and the Form
4’s filed April 10, 2006, related to stock options issued to Executive
Officers.  All of these transactions were
subsequently reported on Form 4 and all transactions are reflective in this

Code of
Ethics

Item
11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation
Discussion and Analysis
Objectives of Compensation
Program and What Our Compensation Program is Designed to Reward
Our executive
compensation program is designed to create strong financial incentive for our
officers to increase revenue, profit, operating efficiency and returns, which
we expect to lead to an increase in shareholder value.  The primary objective of our compensation
program is to attract and retain qualified, energetic employees who are
enthusiastic about the Company’s mission. 
A further objective of our compensation program is to provide incentives
and reward employees for their contribution to the Company.  In addition, we strive to promote an
ownership mentality among key leadership and the Board of Directors.  Finally, we endeavor to ensure that our
compensation program is perceived as fundamentally fair to all stakeholders.
The Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) evaluates both
performance and compensation to ensure that the Company maintains its ability
to attract and retain superior employees in key positions and that compensation
provided to key employees remains competitive relative to the compensation paid
to similarly situated executives of other companies.  To that end, the Committee believes executive
compensation packages provided by the Company to its executives, including the
named executive officers, should include both cash and stock-based components
that reward performance as measured against established goals.
Our compensation
program is designed to reward each employee’s contribution to the Company.  In measuring the named executive officers’
contribution to the Company, the Committee considers numerous factors including
the Company’s growth and financial performance.
Throughout this
Form 10-K, the individual who served as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer during 2006, as well as the other individuals
included in the Summary Compensation Table on page 46, are referred to as the “named
executive officers”.  Immediately
following this Compensation Discussion and Analysis you will find a series of
tables containing specific information about the compensation earned in 2006 by
the named executive officers.
Roles and Responsibilities for
Our Compensation Program
Role of the Compensation Committee
The Committee has
responsibility for establishing, implementing and monitoring adherence with the
Company’s compensation philosophy.
Role of our Chief Executive
Officer
Our Chief
Executive Officer provides recommendations to the Committee in its evaluation
of our executive officers, including recommendations of individual cash and
equity compensation levels for executive officers.  Mr. Levin relies on his personal experience
serving in the capacity of Chief Executive Officer with respect to evaluating the
contribution of our other executive officers as well as publicly available
information for comparable compensation guidance as the basis for his
recommendations to the Committee.  Mr.
Levin was not present during Committee deliberations and voting pertaining to
the determination of his own compensation.
44 


 
Role of the Compensation
Consultant
The Committee
periodically retains a consultant to provide independent advice on executive
compensation matters and to perform specific project-related work.
Elements of Company’s
Compensation Plan
The Company’s
compensation program consists of base salary, an annual incentive bonus, stock
incentives/awards, health and welfare benefits and a 401(k) plan.  The Company strives to be market competitive
in setting salary ranges and designing benefits programs, while recognizing the
experience and performance levels of individual employees.
Base Salary
The Company
provides named executive officers and other employees with base salary to
compensate them for services rendered during the fiscal year.  Base salary is the fixed annual compensation
we pay to an executive for performing specific job responsibilities.  It represents the minimum income an executive
may receive in any given year.  Base
salaries for named executive officers are determined for each executive based
on position and responsibility.  Base
salaries for each of the Company’s executives are determined by the executive’s
responsibilities and performance as well as comparative compensation levels for
the executive’s peers.  The base salary
for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, including periodic changes thereto,
is determined by the Committee.  The base
salaries for the Company’s other executive officers, including periodic changes
thereto, are determined by the Committee following recommendations by the Chief
Executive Officer.
During its review
of base salaries for executives, the Committee primarily considers:
·                  market
data;
·                  internal
review of the executive’s compensation, both individually and relative to other
officers;
·                  individual
performance of the executive;  and
·                  our
financial and operating results.
Base salary levels
are typically reviewed annually as part of the Company’s performance review
process as well as upon a promotion or other change in job responsibility.
Annual Bonus
 The Compensation Committee
believes that a Pay-For-Performance Bonus system must be the process to provide
additional compensation for all Spherix Executives and that this Bonus system
must be based upon performance objectives developed from the Long Range
Business Plan. The President and Chief Executive Officer of Spherix,
working with the Executive Staff, set
the performance bonus objectives.  The
Board’s function was to review, to recommend modifications, and to approve the
objectives and the financial bonuses associated with those objectives.
Stock Incentives/Awards
We currently
administer long-term incentive compensation awards through our stock incentive
plan.  We believe that widespread common
share ownership by key employees is an important means of encouraging superior
performance and employee retention.
In recent years,
this component of the Company’s executive compensation program has been via the
periodic grant of stock options.  The
Company generally has issued stock options to its executive officers when they
joined the Company, in connection with a significant promotion within the
Company and/or as a reward following excellent performance.  The number of options granted has been based
on the level of responsibility, Company performance and individual
performance.  Stock option grants have
also been structured to induce the executive to remain in the employment of the
Company by including incremental vesting provisions which permit exercise only
after satisfaction of minimum tenure requirements.  Options are forfeited upon termination.
45 


 
Health
and Welfare Benefits
We offer a
standard range of health and welfare benefits to all employees, including our
executive officers.  These benefits
include medical, prescription drug, and dental coverages, life insurance,
accidental death and dismemberment and long-term disability insurance.  Our plans do not discriminate in favor of our
executive officers.
401(k)
We offer a defined
contribution 401(k) plan to substantially all of our employees.  We provide this plan to assist our employees
in saving some amount of their cash compensation for retirement in a tax
efficient manner.
Other
Perquisites and Personal Benefits
We do not offer
any perquisites or other personal benefits to any executive with a value over
$10,000.
How Compensation Amounts Are
Determined
We strive to pay
our named executive officers at or near the median paid by comparable
companies.  The Compensation Committee
hired an outside company, Equilar, Inc., to compare the total compensation of
the Spherix Executives to the total compensation of fourteen (14) companies
identified by Equilar, Inc. to be peer companies to Spherix.  The Equilar Report on Executive Compensation
showed that Spherix Executives are not compensated at the same level as
colleagues in peer companies.  Based upon
the fiscal health of Spherix however, it was determined by the Compensation
Committee that no special efforts should be made to bring Executive total
compensation to equivalent levels of those in peer companies.  All 2007 base salary increases (with few
exceptions) should be kept in line with inflation. The Compensation Committee
requested that the President and Chief Executive Officer of Spherix propose all
Executive salary increases, but the overall Spherix company-wide increase
should not be above inflation.  With
minor adjustments, these recommendations were accepted by the full Board.  The Compensation Committee recommended to the
Board the salary adjustment for the President and Chief Executive Officer of
Spherix.

shares, respectively, which such persons have a right to acquire within 60 days
pursuant to stock options.
As of December 31,
2006, Dr. Levin, Chairman of the Board and Executive Officer for Science, and
Mrs. Levin, Director and former Vice President, 3180 Harness Creek Road,
Annapolis, Maryland, beneficially owned in the aggregate 2,728,457 shares of
Common Stock (19.1% of the 14,287,804 outstanding shares1). Dr. Levin and Mrs. Levin are
husband and wife.  As principal
Stockholders of the Company, they are considered control persons with respect
to the Company.
All Directors and
Executive Officers as a group, as beneficial owners of 2,934,932 shares of
Common Stock, owned 20.5% of the 14,287,804 outstanding shares1. With the exception of Cede
& Co., the holder of record for certain brokerage firms and banks, no other
person is known by the Company to own beneficially more than 5% of the
outstanding Common Stock of the Company.
In February 2001,
the Board of Directors adopted the Rights Agreement (the “Agreement”).  The Agreement provides each Stockholder of
record a dividend distribution of one “right” for each outstanding share of the
Company’s Common Stock.  Rights become
exercisable at the earlier of ten days following:  (1) a public announcement that an
acquirer has purchased or has the right to acquire 10% or more of the Company’s
Common Stock, or (2) the commencement of a tender offer which would result
in an offeror beneficially owning 10% or more of the outstanding Common Stock
of the Company.  All rights held by an
acquirer or offeror expire on the announced acquisition date, and all rights
expire at the close of business on December 31, 2010.  Each right entitles a Stockholder to acquire,
at a stated purchase price, 1/100 of a share of the Company’s preferred stock,
which carries voting and dividend rights similar to one share of its Common
Stock.  Alternatively, a right holder may
elect to purchase for the stated price an equivalent number of shares of the
Company’s Common Stock at a price per share equal to one-half of the average
market price for a specified period.  In
lieu of the stated purchase price, a right holder may elect to acquire one-half
of the Common Stock available under the second option.  The purchase price of the preferred stock
fractional amount is subject to adjustment for certain events as described in
the Agreement.  At the discretion of a
majority of the Board and within a specified time period, the Company may
redeem all of the rights at a price of $0.001 per right.  The Board may also amend any provisions of
the Agreement prior to exercise.
Item
13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED
TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
The current Board
of Directors consists of Mr. Douglas T. Brown, Mr. A. Paul Cox, Jr., Mr. George
C. Creel, Dr. Gilbert V. Levin, Mrs. M. Karen Levin, Mr. Richard C. Levin,
Dr. Robert A. Lodder, Jr., and Dr. Robert J. Vander Zanden.  The Board of Directors has determined that a
majority of its members, being Messrs. Brown, Cox, Creel, Lodder, and Vander
Zanden, are independent Directors within the meaning of the applicable NASD
rules.  The Company’s Audit,
Compensation, and Nominating Committees consist solely of independent Directors.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

(1)             Includes
475,600 shares which could be acquired pursuant to stock options or warrants
within 60 days.

independent auditors.  These services may

provided for up to one year.  The Audit
Committee may also pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis.
