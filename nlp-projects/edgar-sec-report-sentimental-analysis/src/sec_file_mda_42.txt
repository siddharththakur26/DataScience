item 2. management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition. overview the corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, exploration and production e p and refining and marketing r m . the e p segment explores for, produces and sells crude oil and natural gas. the r m segment manufactures, purchases, trades and markets refined petroleum products and other energy products. net income was 518 million for the first half of 2005, including 526 million from e p activities and 161 million from r m operations. exploration and production worldwide oil and gas production averaged 355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second quarter of 2005, an increase of 1 over the second quarter of 2004. strong operating performance from existing assets and new production from the jda, clair field, and russia all contributed to these results. for 2005, our current production forecast is 350,000 to 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding any contribution from libya. the corporation continues to believe that re entry into the oasis concessions will happen however, the timing of our return is difficult to predict. in march the corporation announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in samara nafta, a company operating in the volga urals region of russia. since then, the russian venture has acquired three additional licenses, increasing our investment to approximately 200 million. production from russia averaged 7,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. on july 19, the corporation announced that an agreement was signed for the sale of gas from the phu horm field, located onshore thailand. amerada hess is the operator with a 35 interest. gross production from the field is expected to average 80,000 to 100,000 mcf per day in 2007. refining and marketing in the second quarter of 2005, the hovensa refinery operated at full capacity and benefited from a strong margin environment. while the retail marketing business posted higher same store gasoline volumes and convenience store sales compared with last year, income was negatively impacted by lower retail gasoline margins, resulting from the run up in wholesale prices during the quarter. the wilcohess joint venture acquired 102 retail outlets in eastern north carolina. the acquisition, which was financed by the joint venture, with no capital contribution by amerada hess, has solidified its competitive position in north carolina, where it now has 233 sites, and has increased the total number of hess branded retail outlets to 1,355. 11 table of contents part i financial information cont d. overview continued in the second quarter, hess lng, a 50 joint venture, received approval from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to proceed with the weaver s cove lng regasification terminal in fall river, massachusetts. while additional federal, state and local permits are required, the receipt of the ferc certificate is an important milestone. the corporation s current estimate of 2005 capital and exploratory expenditures is 2.4 to 2.6 billion. this level of spending is up from the previous estimate of 2.1 billion and is opportunity driven. the corporation s investment in russia accounts for approximately 200 million of the increase, with the balance coming from additional opportunities in its portfolio. results of operations net income for the second quarter of 2005 amounted to 299 million compared with 288 million in the second quarter of 2004. net income for the first half of 2005 was 518 million compared with 569 million in the first half of 2004. see the following page for a table of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods. the after tax results by major

follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. after tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. 12 table of contents part i financial information

commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity linked securities in its non trading and trading activities. these contracts are widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms. in some cases, physical purchase and sale contracts are used as trading instruments and are included in the trading results. quantitative measures the corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading activities. the value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level. the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. the potential change in fair value based on commodity price risk is presented in the non trading and trading sections below. non trading the corporation s exploration and production segment uses futures and swaps to fix the selling prices of a portion of its future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of its selling prices. as of june 30, the corporation has not hedged any of its future natural gas production. following is a summary of
