item 1a risk factors in this quarterly report on form 10 q for the quarter ended june 30, 2009. overview the company recorded a net loss of 390 million in the second quarter of 2009 compared to a net loss of 1.5 billion in the same period last year second quarter 2008 results include the 1.1 billion impact of the write down of the mcdonnell douglas md 80 and embraer rj 135 fleets and certain related long lived assets to their estimated fair values due to capacity reductions made in response to unprecedentedly high fuel expenses . the company s second quarter 2009 loss is primarily attributable to a significant decrease in passenger revenue due to lower traffic and passenger yield. the company is experiencing significantly weaker demand for air travel driven by the continuing severe downturn in the global economy. mainline passenger revenue decreased by 1.1 billion to 3.7 billion in the three months ended june 30, 2009 compared to the same period last year. mainline passenger unit revenues decreased 16.0 percent for the second quarter due to a 15.4 percent decrease in passenger yield passenger revenue per passenger mile compared to the same period in 2008 and a load factor decrease of approximately one point. in addition, during the second quarter of 2009, there was an outbreak of the h1n1 influenza virus which had an estimated 50 to 80 million adverse revenue impact throughout the company s network, but primarily on operations to and from mexico. as a part of the second quarter 2009 net loss, the company also incurred approximately 70 million in non recurring charges related to the sale of certain aircraft and the grounding of leased airbus a300 aircraft prior to lease expiration. the company implemented capacity reductions in 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009 in response to record high fuel prices. these capacity reductions have somewhat mitigated the weakening of demand and in june 2009, the company announced additional capacity reductions in a further effort to balance supply and demand. amr will reduce mainline seating capacity by approximately 7.5 percent for the full year 2009 versus 2008. the reduction consists of an approximately 9.0 percent reduction in mainline domestic capacity and more than 4.0 percent reduction in mainline international capacity compared to the year ending december 31, 2008. as a result, for the quarter ending september 30, 2009, amr expects mainline domestic capacity to decline by approximately 10.5 percent and mainline international capacity to decline by 6.0 percent compared to the quarter ending september 30, 2008. no assurance can be given that any capacity reductions or other steps the company may take will be adequate to offset the effects of reduced demand. the decrease in total passenger revenue was partially offset by significantly lower year over year fuel prices the company paid an average of 1.90 per gallon in the second quarter 2009 compared to an average of 3.19 per gallon in the same period of 2008, including effects of hedging. the company s unit costs excluding fuel and special charges were greater for the quarter ended june 30, 2009 than for the same period in 2008, and are expected to be higher for each period for the remainder of 2009 compared to the corresponding prior year period. factors driving the increase include increased defined benefit pension expenses due to the stock market decline in 2008 and retiree medical and other expenses, and cost pressures associated with the company s previously announced capacity reductions and dependability initiatives. in reaction to these challenges, the company has continued to work to implement and maintain several key actions designed to help it manage through these near term challenges while seeking to position itself for long term success, including the range of service charges introduced in 2008 to generate additional revenue, execution of its fleet renewal and replacement plan, initiatives to improve dependability and on time performance, and an initiative to strengthen its global network through the application pending with the u.s. department of transportation for global antitrust immunity with four members of the oneworld global alliance. the company s ability to become profitable and its ability to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis will depend on a number of factors, many of which are largely beyond the company s control. certain risk factors that affect the company s business and financial results are discussed in the risk factors listed in item 1a in the 2008 form 10 k and as amended in item 1a in this quarterly report on form 10 q for the quarter ended june 30, 2009. in addition, most of the company s largest domestic competitors and several smaller carriers have filed for bankruptcy in the last several years and have used this process to significantly reduce contractual labor and other costs. in order to remain competitive and to improve its financial condition, the company must continue to take steps to generate additional revenues and to reduce its costs. although the company has a number of initiatives underway to address its cost and revenue challenges, some of these initiatives involve changes to the company s business which it may be unable to implement. in addition, the company expects that, as time goes on, it will be progressively more difficult to identify and implement significant revenue enhancement and cost savings initiatives. the adequacy and ultimate success of the company s initiatives to generate additional revenues and reduce costs are not known at this time and cannot be assured. moreover, whether the company s initiatives will be adequate or successful depends in large measure on factors beyond its control, notably the overall industry environment, including passenger demand, yield and industry capacity growth, and fuel prices. it will be very difficult for the company to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis, and to return to profitability, if the overall industry revenue environment does not improve substantially or if fuel prices were to increase and persist for an extended period at high levels. liquidity and capital resources significant indebtedness and future financing the company remains heavily indebted and has significant obligations including substantial pension funding obligations , as described more fully under item 7, management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the form 8 k. indebtedness is a significant risk to the company as discussed in the risk factors listed in item 1a in the 2008 form 10 k and as amended in item 1a in this quarterly report on form 10 q for the quarter ended june 30, 2009. during 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 through the date of this filing , the company raised an aggregate of approximately 3.4 billion in financing to fund capital commitments mainly for aircraft and ground properties , debt maturities, and employee pension obligations, and to bolster its liquidity. as of the date of this form 10 q, although the company believes it can access sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and obligations for the remainder of 2009, including repayment of debt and capital leases, capital expenditures and other contractual obligations, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so. to meet the company s commitments, to maintain sufficient liquidity and because the company has significant debt, lease and other obligations in the next several years, including commitments to purchase aircraft, as well as substantial pension funding obligations refer to contractual obligations in item 7, management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the form 8 k , the company will need access to substantial additional funding. as of june 30, 2009, the company is required to make scheduled principal payments of approximately 779 million on long term debt and approximately 85 million in payments on capital leases, and the company expects to spend approximately 1.0 billion on capital expenditures for the remainder of 2009. in addition, the global economic downturn, potential increases in the amount of required reserves under credit card processing agreements, and the obligation to post cash collateral on fuel hedging contracts have negatively impacted, and may in the future negatively impact, the company s liquidity. despite the current disruptions in the capital markets, in the six months ended june 30, 2009, the company obtained an aggregate of approximately 470 million of financing under loans secured by various aircraft and sale leaseback financings of certain aircraft the company s possible financing sources primarily include i a limited amount of additional secured aircraft debt or sale leaseback transactions involving owned aircraft ii leases of or debt secured by new aircraft deliveries iii debt secured by other assets iv securitization of future operating receipts v the sale or monetization of certain assets vi unsecured debt and vii issuance of equity and or equity like securities. besides unencumbered aircraft, the company s most likely sources of liquidity include the financing of aadvantage program miles and takeoff and landing slots, and the sale or financing of certain of the company s business units and subsidiaries, such as amr eagle. the company s ability to obtain future financing is limited by the value of its unencumbered assets. a very large majority of the company s aircraft assets including most of the aircraft eligible for the benefits of section 1110 of the u.s. bankruptcy code are encumbered. also, the market value of these aircraft assets has declined in recent years, and may continue to decline. the company believes it has at least 3.7 billion in unencumbered assets and other sources of liquidity as the date of this filing. however, the availability and level of the financing sources described above cannot be assured, particularly in light of the company s and american s financial results in recent years, the company s and american s substantial indebtedness, the difficult revenue environment they face, their reduced credit ratings, recent historically high fuel prices, and the financial difficulties experienced in the airline industry. in addition, the global economic downturn and recent severe disruptions in the capital markets and other sources of funding have resulted in greater volatility, less liquidity, widening of credit spreads and substantially more limited availability of funding. the inability of the company to obtain necessary additional funding on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on the company and on its ability to sustain its operations. the company s substantial indebtedness and other obligations have important consequences. for example, they i limit the company s ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding could be obtained ii require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes iii make the company more vulnerable to economic downturns and iv limit the company s ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. in june 2009, american entered into an amendment to a purchase agreement with boeing. pursuant to the amendment, american exercised rights to purchase an additional eight 737 800 aircraft and the delivery dates of certain aircraft were rescheduled. as a result, american s total 737 800 purchase commitments for 2009 including nine aircraft that have been delivered as of june 30, 2009 have increased from 29 as of march 31, 2009 to 31 as of june 30, 2009, and american s 737 800 purchase commitments for 2010 have increased from 39 as of march 31, 2009 to 45 as of june 30, 2009. american s 737 800 purchase commitments remain at eight in 2011. in addition to these aircraft, american has firm commitments for eleven 737 800 aircraft and seven boeing 777 aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2013 2016. as of june 30, 2009, payments for american s 737 800 and 777 aircraft purchase commitments will approximate 716 million for the remainder of 2009, 1.3 billion in 2010, 354 million in 2011, 217 million in 2012, 399 million in 2013, and 556 million for 2014 and beyond. these amounts are net of purchase deposits currently held by the manufacturer. american previously arranged backstop financing which, together with other financing arranged through the date of this filing, including the pass through certificate financing referred to in the following paragraph, covers all of its 2009 2011 boeing 737 800 aircraft deliveries, subject to certain terms and conditions including, in the case of one of the financing arrangements covering twelve aircraft, a condition that at the time of borrowing, the company has a certain amount of unrestricted cash and short term investments . as more fully described in note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, on july 7, 2009, american obtained financing for four boeing 777 200er aircraft owned by american and 16 boeing 737 800 aircraft to be delivered to american through the issuance of the certificates which raised 520 million. the certificates bear interest at 10.375 per annum. a majority of the proceeds were placed in escrow. as american takes delivery of each boeing 737 800 aircraft it finances under this arrangement, american will issue equipment notes secured by such aircraft to the trust, which will purchase such notes with an allocable portion of the escrowed funds. american will use such funds to finance the purchase of the aircraft and the company will record the principal amount of such equipment notes as debt on its consolidated balance sheet. the company s continued aircraft replacement strategy, and its execution of that strategy, will depend on such factors as future economic and industry conditions and the financial condition of the company. credit facility covenants american has a secured 433 million term loan credit facility with a final maturity on december 17, 2010. american s obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by amr. the credit facility contains a covenant the liquidity covenant requiring american to maintain, as defined, unrestricted cash, unencumbered short term investments and amounts available for drawing under committed revolving credit facilities of not less than 1.25 billion for each quarterly period through the life of the credit facility. amr and american were in compliance with the liquidity covenant as of june 30, 2009. in addition, the credit facility contains a covenant the ebitdar covenant requiring amr to maintain a ratio of cash flow defined as consolidated net income, before interest expense less capitalized interest , income taxes, depreciation and amortization and rentals, adjusted for certain gains or losses and non cash items to fixed charges comprising interest expense less capitalized interest and rentals . in june 2009, amr and american entered into an amendment to the credit facility which waived compliance with the ebitdar covenant for the quarter ended june 30, 2009 however, even absent this waiver the company would have complied with this covenant as of june 30, 2009. in addition, the amendment reduced the minimum ratios amr is required to satisfy to 0.95 to 1.00 for the one, two and three quarter periods ending september 30, 2009, december 31, 2009 and march 31, 2010, respectively, to 1.00 to 1.00 for the four quarter period ending june 30, 2010, and to 1.05 to 1.00 for the four quarter period ending september 30, 2010. given the volatility of fuel prices and revenues, uncertainty in the capital markets and uncertainty about other sources of funding, and other factors, it is difficult to assess whether the company will be able to continue to comply with the liquidity covenant and the ebitdar covenant, and there are no assurances that it will be able to do so. failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under the credit facility which if the company did not take steps to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate, the default could result in a default under a significant amount of its other debt and lease obligations, and otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company and its ability to sustain its operations. credit card processing and other reserves american has agreements with a number of credit card companies and processors to accept credit cards for the sale of air travel and other services. under certain of american s current credit card processing agreements, the related credit card company or processor may hold back, under certain circumstances, a reserve from american s credit card receivables. under one such agreement, which was recently amended, the amount of such reserve generally is based on the amount of unrestricted cash not including undrawn credit facilities held by the company and the processor s exposure to the company under the agreement. given the volatility of fuel prices and revenues, uncertainty in the capital markets and uncertainty about other sources of funding, and other factors, it is difficult to forecast the required amount of such reserve at any time. the amount of the reserve was 154 million as of june 30, 2009. the agreement limits the maximum amount of the reserve determined as described above during the period ending february 15, 2010, and the company currently estimates such maximum amount during that period to be approximately 300 million. however, if current conditions persist, absent a waiver or modification of the agreement, such required amount could be substantially greater after such period. pension funding obligation the company is required to make minimum contributions to its defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act erisa , the pension funding equity act of 2004 and the pension protection act of 2006. the company is not required to make any 2009 contributions to its defined benefit pension plans under the provisions of these acts. although the company is not required to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2009, based on current funding levels of the plans, the company expects that the amount of the required contributions will be substantial in 2010 and future years. the company expects to contribute approximately 13 million to its retiree medical and other benefit plan in 2009. cash flow activity at june 30, 2009, the company had 2.8 billion in unrestricted cash and short term investments, reflecting a decrease of 299 million from the balance of 3.1 billion at december 31, 2008. net cash provided by operating activities in the six month period ended june 30, 2009 was 938 million, a decrease of 216 million over the same period in 2008. the decline in unrestricted cash and short term investments is primarily due to the significant decline in the demand for air travel, which resulted in a 22.7 percent decrease in passenger revenue, and principal payments made during the first six months of 2009. the impact of these two factors was somewhat offset by the year over year decrease in fuel prices from 2.97 per gallon for the first six months of 2008 to 1.90 per gallon for the same period in 2009. the fuel price decrease resulted in 1.5 billion in decremental year over year expense in the six months ended june 30, 2009 based on the year over year decrease in the average price per gallon multiplied by gallons consumed . the company made scheduled debt and capital lease payments of 1.2 billion in the first six months of 2009. included in this amount, amr retired, by purchasing with cash, the 318 million principal amount of its 4.50 notes. virtually all of the holders of the 4.50 notes exercised their elective put rights and the company purchased and retired these notes at a price equal to 100 percent of their principal amount. under the terms of the 4.50 notes, the company had the option to pay the purchase price with cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock, and the company elected to pay for the 4.50 notes solely with cash. also included in total scheduled debt payments, the company retired, at maturity, its 255 million secured bank revolving credit facility in june 2009. despite the current disruptions in the capital markets, in the six months ended june 30, 2009, the company obtained an aggregate of approximately 470 million of financing under loans secured by various aircraft and sale leaseback financings of certain aircraft. capital expenditures for the first six months of 2009 were 602 million and primarily consisted of new aircraft and certain aircraft modifications. due to the current value of the company s derivative contracts, some agreements with counterparties require collateral to be deposited by the company. as of june 30, 2009, the cash collateral held by such counterparties from amr was 59 million. the amount of collateral required to be deposited with the company or with the counterparty by the company is based on fuel price in relation to the market values of the derivative contracts and collateral provisions per the terms of those contracts and can fluctuate significantly. the company was over collateralized as of june 30, 2009 due to a timing lag in collateral reconciliation with a certain counterparty. the company is currently required to collateralize approximately 100 percent of the outstanding liability hedge contracts. as such, when these contracts settle, the collateral posted with counterparties will effectively offset the loss position and minimal further cash impact will be recorded assuming a static forward heating oil curve from june 30, 2009. under the same assumption, the company does not currently expect to be required to deposit significant additional cash collateral above june 30, 2009 levels with counterparties with regard to fuel hedges in place as of june 30, 2009. additional information regarding the company s fuel hedging program is also included in item 3 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and in note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. war risk insurance the u.s. government has agreed to provide commercial war risk insurance for u.s. based airlines until september 30, 2009, covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. if the u.s. government does not extend the policy beyond that date, or if the u.s. government at anytime thereafter ceases to provide such insurance, or reduces the coverage provided by such insurance, the company will attempt to purchase similar coverage with narrower scope from commercial insurers at an additional cost. to the extent this coverage is not available at commercially reasonable rates, the company would be adversely affected. while the price of commercial insurance has declined since the premium increases immediately after terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001, in the event commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to the company, or significantly increase its cost, the company would be adversely affected. results of operations for the three months ended june 30, 2009 and 2008 revenues the company s revenues decreased approximately 1.3 billion, or 20.9 percent, to 4.9 billion in the second quarter of 2009 from the same period last year. american s passenger revenues decreased by 22.3 percent, or 1.1 billion, on a 7.6 percent decrease in capacity available seat mile asm . american s passenger load factor decreased by approximately one point to 81.8 percent while passenger yield decreased by 15.4 percent to 11.65 cents. this resulted in a decrease in passenger revenue per available seat mile rasm of 16.0 percent to 9.53 cents. following is additional information regarding american s domestic and international rasm and capacity three months ended june 30, 2009 rasm cents y o y change asms

regional affiliates include two wholly owned subsidiaries, american eagle airlines, inc. and executive airlines, inc. collectively, amr eagle , and an independent carrier with which american has a capacity purchase agreement, chautauqua airlines, inc. chautauqua . regional affiliates passenger revenues, which are based on industry standard proration agreements for flights connecting to american flights, decreased 170 million, or 24.9 percent, to 513 million as a result of a reduction in capacity, decreased passenger traffic and lower yield. regional affiliates traffic decreased 9.1 percent to 2.2 billion revenue passenger miles rpms , on a capacity decrease of 10.8 percent to 2.9 billion asms, resulting in a 1.4 point increase in the passenger load factor to 74.7 percent. cargo revenues decreased by 42.5 percent, or 99 million, primarily due to decreases in advertising mail and freight traffic resulting from the current economic downturn. other revenues increased 7.0 percent, or 37 million, to 565 million due to increases in certain passenger service charges. operating expenses the company s total operating expenses decreased 31.5 percent, or 2.4 billion, to 5.1 billion in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2008. the company s operating expenses per asm in the second quarter of 2009 decreased 25.7 percent to 12.33 cents compared to the second quarter of 2008. these decreases are largely due to an impairment charge of 1.1 billion to write the mcdonnell douglas md 80 and embraer rj 135 fleets and certain related long lived assets down to their estimated fair values in 2008, and to decreased fuel prices in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2008. these decreases were somewhat offset by increased defined benefit pension expenses and retiree medical and other expenses due to the stock market decline in 2008 , and by cost pressures associated with the company s previously announced capacity reductions and dependability initiatives. in millions operating expenses three months ended june 30, 2009 change from 2008 percentage change wages, salaries and benefits 1,698 40 2.4 aircraft fuel 1,334 1,089

decreased due to impairment charge in 2008. c commissions, booking fees and credit card expense decreased in conjunction with the 20.9 percent decrease in the company s revenue. d special charges in

other income expense interest income decreased 39 million due to both a decrease in short term investment balances and a decrease in interest rates. interest expense decreased 32 million as a result of a decrease in the company s long term debt balance and lower variable interest rates. income tax the company did not record a net tax provision benefit associated with its second quarter 2009 or second quarter 2008 losses due to the company providing a valuation allowance, as discussed in note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. operating statistics the following table

for flights connecting to american flights, decreased 294 million, or 23.3 percent, to 970 million as a result of a reduction in capacity, decreased passenger traffic and lower yield. regional affiliates traffic decreased 11.0 percent to 4.0 billion revenue passenger miles rpms , on a capacity decrease of 10.0 percent to 5.7 billion asms, resulting in an approximately one point decrease in the passenger load factor to 70.4 percent. cargo revenues decreased by 37.9 percent, or 170 million, primarily due to decreases in advertising mail and freight traffic resulting from the current

estimated fair values. other income expense interest income decreased 81 million due to both a decrease in short term investment balances and a decrease in interest rates. interest expense decreased 52 million as a result of a decrease in the company s long term debt balance and lower variable interest rates. income tax the company did not record a net tax provision benefit associated with its loss for the six months ended june 30, 2009 or june 30, 2008 due to the company providing a valuation allowance, as discussed in note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. operating statistics the following table provides statistical information for american and regional affiliates for the six months ended june 30, 2009 and 2008. six months ended june 30, 2009 2008 american

2008, respectively. outlook the company currently expects capacity for american s mainline jet operations to decline by approximately 8.5 percent in the third quarter of 2009 versus the third quarter of 2008. american s mainline capacity for the full year 2009 is expected to decrease approximately 7.5 percent from 2008 with approximately a 9.0 percent reduction in domestic capacity and more than a 4.0 percent decrease in international capacity. the company currently expects third quarter 2009 mainline unit costs to decrease approximately 14.3 percent year over year primarily due to historically high fuel costs recorded in the third quarter 2008, somewhat offset by increased defined benefit pension expenses due to the stock market decline in 2008 and retiree medical and other benefit expenses, and by cost pressures associated with the company s previously announced capacity reductions and dependability initiatives. due to these cost pressures, the company expects third quarter and full year 2009 unit costs excluding fuel to be higher than the respective prior year periods. the company s results are significantly affected by the price of jet fuel, which is in turn affected by a number of factors beyond the company s control. although fuel prices have abated somewhat from the record prices recorded in july 2008, fuel prices have increased since the first quarter of 2009 and they remain high and very volatile. the company is experiencing significantly weaker demand for air travel driven by the severe downturn in the global economy. the company implemented capacity reductions in 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009 in response to record high fuel prices. those capacity reductions have somewhat mitigated this weakening of demand, and in june 2009, the company announced additional capacity reductions in a further effort to balance supply and demand. however, if the global economic downturn persists or worsens, demand for air travel may continue to weaken. no assurance can be given that capacity reductions or other steps the company may take will be adequate to offset the effects of reduced demand. in addition, fare discounting has recently been both broader and deeper than usual, and the company expects downward pressure on passenger yields into the third quarter. critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable however, actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates. the company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used by management in the preparation of the company s financial statements accounting for fair value, long lived assets, routes, passenger revenue, frequent flyer program, stock compensation, pensions and retiree medical and other benefits, income taxes and derivatives accounting. these policies and estimates are described in the form 8 k except as updated below. routes amr performs annual impairment tests on its routes, which are indefinite life intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards no. 142 goodwill and other intangibles and as a result they are not amortized. the company also performs impairment tests when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. these tests are primarily based on estimates of discounted future cash flows, using assumptions based on historical results adjusted to reflect the company s best estimate of future market and operating conditions. the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value. the company's estimates of fair value represent its best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions. renewal and extension costs for the company s intangible assets are minimal and are expensed as incurred. in september 2006, the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no. 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 . sfas 157 introduces a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities. sfas 157 2, applicable to non financial assets and liabilities, is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2008, and the company has adopted the standard for those assets and liabilities as of january 1, 2009. annual impairment testing on the company s routes will occur in the fourth quarter of 2009, at which time the net carrying value of the routes will be reassessed for recoverability. if it at that time, the fair value of the routes is less than the carrying value, the company will adjust the value of the route assets and apply sfas 157 2 provisions to its routes. the company had recorded route acquisition costs including international routes and slots of 831 million as of june 30, 2009, including a significant amount related to operations at london heathrow. the company has completed an impairment analysis on the london heathrow routes including slots as of december 2008, resulting in no impairment. however, given the significant uncertainty regarding the long term impact of open skies, ultimate depth of the economic recession and how these events ultimately affect the company s operations at heathrow, the actual results could differ from those estimates. item 3. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk there have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of the form 8 k. the change in market risk for aircraft fuel is discussed below for informational purposes. the risk inherent in the company s fuel related market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel. the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate the company s exposure to such changes. therefore, actual results may differ. the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. aircraft fuel the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. in order to provide a measure of control over price and supply, the company trades and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage facilities to support its flight operations. the company also manages the price risk of fuel costs primarily by using jet fuel and heating oil hedging contracts. market risk is estimated as a hypothetical ten percent increase in the june 30, 2009 cost per gallon of fuel. based on projected 2009 and 2010 fuel usage through june 30, 2010, such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately 441 million in the twelve months ended june 30, 2010, inclusive of the impact of effective fuel hedge instruments outstanding at june 30, 2009, and assumes the company s fuel hedging program remains effective under statement of financial accounting standard no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities . comparatively, based on projected 2009 fuel usage, such an increase would have resulted in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately 399 million in the twelve months ended december 31, 2008, inclusive of the impact of fuel hedge instruments outstanding at december 31, 2008. the change in market risk is primarily due to the decrease in fuel prices. ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in crude oil or other crude oil related commodities. as required by statement of financial accounting standard no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 , the company assesses, both at the inception of each hedge and on an on going basis, whether the derivatives that are used in its hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. in doing so, the company uses a regression model to determine the correlation of the change in prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel e.g. nymex heating oil to the change in the price of jet fuel. the company also monitors the actual dollar offset of the hedges market values as compared to hypothetical jet fuel hedges. the fuel hedge contracts are generally deemed to be highly effective if the r squared is greater than 80 percent and the dollar offset correlation is within 80 percent to 125 percent. the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively if it determines that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if it decides to discontinue the hedging relationship. as of june 30, 2009, the company had cash flow hedges, with collars and options, covering approximately 32 percent of its estimated remaining 2009 fuel requirements. the consumption hedged for the remainder of 2009 is capped at an average price of approximately 2.49 per gallon of jet fuel, and the company s collars have an average floor price of approximately 1.80 per gallon of jet fuel both the capped and floor price exclude taxes and transportation costs . the company s collars represent approximately 28 percent of its estimated remaining 2009 fuel requirements. a deterioration of the company s financial position could negatively affect the company s ability to hedge fuel in the future.
