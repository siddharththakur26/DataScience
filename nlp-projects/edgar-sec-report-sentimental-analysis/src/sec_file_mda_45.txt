moving and storage operations revenues consist of rental revenues and net sales. total rental revenue was 907.8 million and 848.8 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. net revenues from the rental of moving related equipment increased by 56.5 million. this increase is primarily attributable to higher truck rental revenues. the growth in truck rental revenue primarily reflects improved utilization, an increase in the average revenue per transaction and higher truck rental inventory. net sales revenues were 148.7 million and 143.2 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. revenue growth from propane sales, which was up by 10.2 during the nine months ended december 31, 1999, and from the sale of moving support items i.e. boxes, etc. , which was up by 3.5 during the nine months ended december 31, 1999, led to the improvement. cost of sales was 87.7 million and 84.6 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. a higher sales volume contributed to the increase. operating expenses before intercompany eliminations increased to 721.0 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1999 from 679.9 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1998. increased expenditure levels for rental equipment maintenance and personnel, due to an increase in truck rental transactions and in fleet size, were primarily responsible. lease expense was 97.7 million and 87.5 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. this increase reflects additional leasing activity over the past twelve months. net depreciation expense for the nine months ended december 31, 1999 was 54.8 million, as compared to 45.0 million in the same period of the prior year. the increase reflects an increase in depreciation recognized on the rental truck fleet. 23 real estate operations rental revenue before intercompany eliminations was 55.0 million and 56.1 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. intercompany revenue was 53.1 million and 54.5 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. net investment and interest income was 5.7 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1999 as compared to 2.5 million during the same period of the prior year. this increase correlates to a significant increase in average note and mortgage receivables outstanding. operating expenses were 3.2 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1999 versus 4.7 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1998. reduced building maintenance expense accounted for the majority of the decline from the prior year. lease expense for the nine months ended december 31, 1999 and 1998 was 1.3 million and 0.1 million, respectively. the increase reflects payments under a synthetic lease facility being utilized to develop storage properties. net depreciation expense for the nine months ended december 31, 1999 was 6.8 million, as compared to 8.5 million in the same period of the prior year. the decrease reflects higher gains from the disposition of property and lower levels of depreciable assets. property and casualty republic's premiums were 100.3 million and 104.7 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the decrease in premium for 1999 as compared to 1998 resulted from the u haul liability programs in the rental industry, which decreased to 35.6 million from 50.9 million, respectively. this decrease resulted from the restructuring of the u haul business auto general liability policy. the deductible was changed at april 1, 1999 from a flat deductible to a 95 deductible. this reduced premiums by 14.5 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 as compared to 1998. the impact of this change will result in an overall savings of 0.6 million in premium taxes for 1999. additionally, assumed treaty reinsurance increased to 35.0 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 as compared to 34.0 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1998. direct multiple peril and general agency premium increased to 17.9 million and 11.6 million, respectively, for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 compared to 15.2 million and 4.6 million, respectively, for the nine months ended september 30, 1998. net investment income was 24.8 million and 27.2 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the decrease from 1998 to 1999 is attributable to a decrease in invested assets and a lower yield on reinvested funds. benefits and losses were 82.4 million and 86.7 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the decrease from 1998 to 1999 resulted from a decrease in the u haul liability programs for unpaid reported claims corresponding to the decrease in premiums mentioned above. deferred acquisition costs dac consist of commissions and other costs, which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business. the prior year commissions, and other related expenses, are amortized over the following year. the amortization expenses for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998 were 10.1 million and 5.4 million, respectively. the increase from 1998 to 1999 is due mainly to republic's subsidiary company's dac expense, which increased to 3.0 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 from a negligible amount for the nine months ended september 30, 1998. also contributing was a 1.4 million increase in the nonaffiliated agents expense. the field underwriting and mobile home programs increased due to 1998 written and unearned premiums and the excess worker's compensation program increased due to 1998 commission expenses relating to a settlement agreement with the previous general agent. operating expenses were 23.5 million and 25.7 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. commissions decreased to 12.0 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 compared to 14.9 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1998. this is mainly attributable to republic's subsidiary's dac earned for the nine months ended september 30, 1999. this subsidiary was purchased in december 1998 therefore, there was no dac included for this subsidiary for the nine months ended september 30, 1998. additionally, there was an increase in the nonaffiliated agents and assumed treaty reinsurance dac earned relating to the increase in the dac expense mentioned above. slightly offsetting were increased lease expenses of 1.4 million and 0.8 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. all other underwriting expenses were 10.1 million and 10.0 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. 24 operating profit before tax and intercompany elimination was 9.1 million and 14.1 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. this represents a decrease in 1999 of 5.0 million from 1998 and resulted mainly from decreased premium revenue and investment income. life insurance net premiums were 71.5 million and 71.4 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. oxford realized premium increases in the areas of medicare supplement, credit life and disability and single premium whole life insurance products. oxford increased medicare supplement premium through the reinsurance of a block of policies and by adding direct premium through new programs these increased premiums by 6.1 million. oxford began marketing a new single premium whole life policy in 1998 this product accounted for 2.9 million of new premiums in 1999 over 1998. with the sale of nafcic, credit insurance premiums decreased by 4.3 million. as expected, premiums decreases occurred in non essential nai lines that were terminated and due to fewer annuitizations. these changes accounted for a 4.7 million decrease in premiums through the first nine months of 1999. net investment income before intercompany eliminations was 15.8 million and 14.5 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. this increase is due to the increase in the average invested assets for the year, which was the result of new premium in 1999 and the increased asset base from the acquisition of nai and safe mate. benefits incurred were 44.6 million and 43.8 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. this increase is primarily due to medicare supplement benefits incurred. these benefits are related to the new business recorded in 1998. the new medicare supplement reinsurance accounted for 3.7 million of benefit variance. annuity benefits combined with the elimination of non focused nai health lines reduced benefits by 2.9 million. amortization of dac and the value of business acquired voba was 17.2 million and 19.7 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. oxford defers commissions and other policy acquisition costs on single premium business. these costs are amortized as the premium is earned over the term of the policy. oxford continues to increase its single premium credit business in force, thus increasing both the deferred costs on the balance sheet and the subsequent amortization. after oxford purchased nai in 1997, oxford began dynamically amortizing the voba asset recognized at purchase. this asset relates to the future profits of the credit insurance policies in force at the time of purchase. the amortization of this asset led to higher 1998 amortization amounts. in 1999, oxford did not have amortization charges related to nafcic that were present in 1998. operating expenses were 15.3 million and 12.7 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. commissions have increased 1.5 million in 1999 in proportion to the increase in new premium. operating expenses, still within budgeted expectations, have increased in 1999 due to the expansion of business volume. operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was 10.3 million and 9.7 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the increase over the prior year reflects improved investment returns, a result of a higher asset base from new business and acquisitions, improving loss ratios on the medicare supplement business and better than expected loss experience for the credit business. interest expense interest expense was 61.0 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1999, as compared to 55.0 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1998. the increase can be attributed to an increase in average debt outstanding and a modest increase in the average cost of debt. 25 consolidated group as a result of the foregoing, pretax earnings of 116.0 million were realized in the nine months ended december 31, 1999, as compared to 116.9 million for the same period in 1998. after providing for income taxes, net earnings for the nine months ended december 31, 1999 were 75.1 million, as compared to 75.9 million for the same period of the prior year. quarterly results the following table presents unaudited quarterly results for the eleven quarters in the period beginning april 1, 1997 and

were 38.5 million in the quarter ended december 31, 1999 as compared to net sales of 35.6 million in the quarter ended december 31, 1998. revenue growth from the sale of propane and hitches led to the majority of the increase during the quarter. cost of sales was 25.0 million in the quarter ended december 31, 1999, which represents an increase from 21.7 million for the same period of the prior year. increased material costs and a higher sales volume contributed to the increase. operating expenses before intercompany elimination increased to 244.6 million in the quarter ended december 31, 1999 from 219.9 million in the quarter ended december 31, 1998. the increase reflects higher personnel and rental equipment maintenance expenditures associated with an increase in truck rental transactions and inventory levels. also contributing was an increase in advertising expense as providers shifted the publish dates of several directories to december 1999 to avoid possible y2k problems. lease expense was 34.1 million and 31.1 million for the quarters ended december 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the increase reflects additional leasing activity. net depreciation expense

republic's premiums were 35.7 million and 39.5 million for the quarters ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the premium decrease in 1999 compared to 1998 resulted from the u haul liability programs in the rental industry, which decreased to 11.7 million from 22.2 million, respectively. this decrease resulted from the restructuring of the u haul business auto general liability policy. the deductible was changed at april 1, 1999 from a flat deductible to a 95 deductible. this reduced premiums by 10.9 million for the quarter ended september 30, 1999 as compared to 1998. the

related expenses, are amortized over the following year. amortization expenses was 3.3 million and 3.0 million for the quarters ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the increase from 1998 to 1999 is mainly due to republic's subsidiary company's dac expenses, which increased to 1.1 million for the quarter ended september 30, 1999 from a negligible amount for the quarter ended september 30, 1998. offsetting this increase were decreases in assumed treaty reinsurance of 0.5 million and in nonaffiliated agents of 0.1 million. operating expenses were 7.8 million and 7.6 million for the quarters ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. commissions increased slightly to 3.5 million for the quarter ended september 30, 1999 compared to 3.3 million for the quarter ended september

september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. oxford realized a premium decrease in the areas of medicare supplement business. in the third quarter of 1998, oxford acquired a block of medicare supplement policies through the reinsurance. through the acquisition accounting for this transaction, oxford recognized the transferred reserves as premium in the quarter this accounts for 7.6 million of the variance. production sales of oxford's new single premium whole life policy increased by 0.6 million in the third quarter compared to 1998. these increases were offset by fewer reinsurance annuitizations in 1999 than in 1998, leading to 0.8 million less in annuity premium. credit life and disability premiums decreased by 2.3 million for the quarter as a result of oxford's sale of its nafcic subsidiary. in addition, there were 0.7 million in premium decreases for the third quarter resulting from the planned termination of nai products not part of oxford's strategic focus. net investment income before intercompany eliminations was 5.7 million and 5.0 million for the quarters ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. this increase is due to a larger invested base.

acquisition costs on single premium business. these costs are amortized as the premium is earned over the term of the policy. oxford continues to increase its single premium credit business in force, thus increasing both the deferred costs on the balance sheet and the subsequent amortization. after oxford purchased nai in 1997, oxford began dynamically amortizing the voba asset recognized at the time of purchase. the amortization curve decreases as the underlying profits are recognized. this asset relates to the future profits of the credit insurance policies in force at the time of purchase. in addition, the amortization charge decreased due to the sale of nafcic. operating expenses were 5.8 million and 3.6 million for the quarters ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. operating expenses for the quarter increased by 0.2 million stemming from the administration costs associated with new reinsurance contracts. oxford's intercompany interest charges increased by 0.2 million for the outstanding surplus notes due amerco. other increases resulted from new product development activities. operating profit before tax and intercompany eliminations was 3.8 million and 3.0 million for the quarters ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the increase stems from improved investment income performance for the quarter. interest expense interest expense was 21.2 million for the quarter ended december 31, 1999, as compared to 18.4 million for the quarter ended december 31, 1998. the increase can be attributed to a higher level of average debt outstanding. consolidated group as a result of the foregoing, a pretax loss of 14.8 million was recognized during the quarter ended december 31, 1999, as compared to pretax earnings of 4.3 million for the same period in 1998. after providing for income taxes, the net loss for the quarter ended december 31, 1999 was 9.3 million, as compared to net earnings of 2.5 million for the same period of the prior year. 30 liquidity and capital resources moving and storage operations to meet the needs of its customers, u haul must maintain a large inventory of fixed asset rental items. at december 31, 1999, net property, plant and equipment represented approximately 63.9 of total assets from non insurance operations and approximately 43.1 of consolidated assets. in the nine months ended december 31, 1999, capital expenditures were 269.5 million, as compared to 235.0 million in the nine months ended december 31, 1998. these expenditures primarily reflect the expansion of the rental truck fleet. the capital required to fund these acquisitions was obtained through internally generated funds from operations and through lease financings. cash flow from operations was 131.9 million in the nine months ended december 31, 1999, as compared to 65.8 million in the nine months ended december 31, 1998. the increase results from a combination of earnings growth, higher levels of depreciation and amortization and changes in other operating assets and liabilities. at december 31, 1999, total outstanding notes and loans payable was 1,101.8 million as compared to 1,114.7 million at march 31, 1999. real estate operations cash provided by operating activities was 10.7 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1999. cash used by operating activities was 7.4 million for the nine months ended december 31, 1998. the increase resulted from a combination of increased earnings and changes in other operating assets and liabilities. property and casualty cash flows used by operating activities were 9.2 million and 29.6 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the 1999 to 1998 change resulted from decreased paid losses recoverable, decreased accounts receivable and a smaller increase in funds withheld. offsetting this increase in cash was a decrease in unearned premium reserves. republic's cash and cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio were 1.4 million and 9.3 million at september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the decrease from 1998 to 1999 resulted from the timing difference of maturities calls being reinvested. this level of liquid assets, combined with budgeted cash flow, is adequate to meet periodic needs. capital and operating budgets allow republic to schedule cash needs in accordance with investment and underwriting proceeds. republic maintains a diversified securities investment portfolio, primarily in bonds, at varying maturity levels with 94.1 of the fixed income securities consisting of investment grade securities. the maturity distribution is designed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future cash needs. current liquidity remains strong with current invested assets equal to 108.4 of total liabilities. the liability for reported and unreported losses are based upon company historical and industry averages. unpaid loss adjustment expenses are based on historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid. unpaid loss and loss expenses are not discounted. stockholder's equity was 216.1 million and 207.1 million at september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. republic considers current stockholder's equity to be adequate to support future growth and absorb unforeseen risk events. republic does not use debt or equity issues to increase capital and therefore has no exposure to capital market conditions. 31 life insurance oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts from interest sensitive products and investment income. the primary uses of cash are operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders. matching the investment portfolio to the cash flow demands of the types of insurance being written is an important consideration. benefit and claim statistics are continually monitored to provide projections of future cash requirements. cash flows provided by operating activities were 5.6 million and 11.3 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. cash flows provided used by financing activities were approximately 0.1 million and 10.1 million for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. cash flows from deferred annuity sales increase investment contract deposits, which are a component of financing activities, as well as the purchase of fixed maturities, which are a component of investing activities. the decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 1999 compared to the first nine months of 1998 is due to lower ratio of annuity deposits to withdrawals. in addition to cash flows from operating and financing activities, a substantial amount of liquid funds is available through oxford's short term portfolio. at september 30, 1999 and 1998, short term investments were 52.1 million and 32.3 million, respectively. management believes that the overall sources of liquidity will continue to meet foreseeable cash needs. stockholder's equity of oxford decreased to 87.3 million in 1999 from 96.2 million in 1998. the decrease is a result of the unrealized losses on the available for sale investment portfolio. oxford did not pay dividends in 1999 or 1998. applicable laws and regulations of the state of arizona require amerco's insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum capital and surplus determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. with respect to oxford, the amount is 450,000. in addition, the amount of dividends that can be paid to shareholders by insurance companies domiciled in the state of arizona is limited. any dividend in excess of the limit requires prior regulatory approval. statutory surplus which can be distributed as dividends without regulatory approval is 0.7 million at september 30, 1999. these restrictions are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of amerco to meet its cash obligations. consolidated group during each of the fiscal years ended march 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, u haul estimates gross capital expenditures will average approximately 325 million primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation. this level of capital expenditures, combined with an average of approximately 30 115 million in annual long term debt maturities during this same period, are expected to create annual average funding needs of approximately 355 440 million. management estimates that u haul will fund 100 of these requirements with internally generated funds, including proceeds from the disposition of older trucks and other asset sales. credit agreements amerco's operations are funded by various credit and financing arrangements, including unsecured long term borrowings, unsecured medium term notes
