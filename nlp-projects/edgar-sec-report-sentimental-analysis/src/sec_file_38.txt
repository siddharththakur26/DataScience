PART I  -  FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




 
 
 




Note 1 -

 
The financial statements included in this report reflect all
normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the
Corporation’s consolidated financial position at June 30, 2004
and December 31, 2003, the consolidated results of operations
for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004 and
2003 and the consolidated cash flows for the six-month periods
ended June 30, 2004 and 2003. The unaudited results of
operations for the interim periods reported are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the full year.


 
 
 




 
Certain notes and other information have been condensed or
omitted from these interim financial statements. These
statements, therefore, should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes included in
the 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders, which have been
incorporated by reference in the Corporation’s Form 10-K, as
amended, for the year ended December 31, 2003.


 
 
 


Note 2 -

 
In 2003, the Corporation took initiatives to reshape its
portfolio of exploration and production assets to reduce costs,
lengthen reserve lives, provide capital for investment and
reduce debt.


 
 
 




 
In the second quarter of 2003, the Corporation sold producing
properties in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, the Jabung Field in Indonesia
and several small United Kingdom fields for $445 million. In the first
half of 2003, the Corporation exchanged crude oil producing properties
in Colombia (acquired in 2001 as part of the Triton acquisition), plus
$10 million in cash, for an additional 25% interest in natural gas
reserves in a non-producing property under development in the joint
development area of Malaysia and Thailand. After tax income from
discontinued operations was $14 million for the second quarter of 2003
and $53 million for the first six months of 2003. The net gain from
asset sales from discontinued operations was $175 million and $116
million for the same periods. The net production from fields sold or
exchanged at the time of disposition was approximately 45,000 barrels
of oil equivalent per day.


 
 
 




 
Income from discontinued operations of $7 million in the second quarter
of 2004 reflects the settlement of a previously accrued contingency
relating to a foreign exploration and production operation that was
disposed of in 2003.

Note 10 -

 
The Corporation records compensation expense for nonvested common stock awards
(restricted stock) ratably over the vesting period, which is generally three to five
years. The Corporation uses the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock
options. Because the exercise prices of employee stock options equal or exceed the
market price of the stock on the date of grant, the Corporation does not recognize
compensation expense.


 
 
 




 
The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of employee
stock options for pro forma disclosure. Using the fair value method, stock option
expense would be recognized over the one- to three-year vesting periods. The
following pro forma financial information presents the effect on net income and
earnings per share as if the Corporation used the fair value method (in millions,
except per share data):

The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in other
comprehensive income to earnings at the time the hedged transactions
are recognized. Hedging
decreased exploration and production results by $124 million ($198
million before income taxes) in the second quarter of 2004 and $197
million ($316 million before income taxes)

in the first half of 2004. Hedging decreased exploration and production results by $45 million
($72 million before income taxes) in the second quarter of 2003 and
$147 million ($235 million before income taxes) in the first half of
2003.


 
 
 




 
At June 30, 2004, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
included after-tax deferred losses of $543 million ($116 million of
realized losses and $427 million of unrealized losses) related to crude
oil and natural gas contracts used as hedges of exploration and
production sales. In its energy marketing business, the Corporation
has entered into cash flow hedges to fix the purchase prices of natural
gas, heating oil, residual fuel oil and electricity related to
contracted future sales. At June 30, 2004, the net after-tax deferred
gain in accumulated other comprehensive income from these hedge
contracts was $47 million.


 
 
 


Note 12 -

 
In the first quarter of 2004, the Corporation guaranteed its share of an investee’s borrowings to finance
construction of an oil pipeline. The amount guaranteed at June 30, 2004 is approximately $39 million. The
guarantee will last through the end of pipeline construction, which is expected to be approximately two
years.

Note 14 -

 
On January 1, 2003, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations as required by
FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Using the accounting method required by FAS No. 143, the
Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations associated
with long-lived assets in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred. The Corporation capitalizes
the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. The cumulative effect
of this change in the first half of 2003 was a credit to income of $7 million or $.07 per share, basic and diluted.

Item 2.

 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.


 
 
 




 
Overview


 
 
 




 
Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2004 was $281 million and net income was $288 million.


 
 
 




 
The Corporation’s refining and marketing business posted quarterly earnings of $160 million. These results benefited from the operations
of the HOVENSA joint venture refinery, which ran near full capacity during the quarter and experienced strong refining margins.


 
 
 




 
Exploration and production operations generated income of $182 million for the second quarter of 2004. Worldwide oil and gas production
averaged 349,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the first half of the year. As a result of this production performance, the
Corporation anticipates that full-year 2004 production will average 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase from the
previous estimate of 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. However, in the third quarter, production will be lower than in the first
half of the year, primarily as a result of normal North Sea facilities maintenance.


 
 
 




 
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Llano Field, in which the Corporation has a 50% interest, commenced production on April 30. Net
production is currently in excess of 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.


 
 
 




 
On Block A-18 in the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area, the installation of the offshore pipeline was completed during the second
quarter and construction of the onshore portion of the pipeline is on schedule to be completed by early 2005. It is estimated that first
gas production will occur during the first half of 2005.


 
 
 




 
In Equatorial Guinea, the Corporation submitted the Plan of Development for the Northern Block G fields to the government on June 7. In
August 2004, the Corporation announced that the Plan of Development was approved by the government of Equatorial Guinea. First production
is expected to occur by the first quarter of 2007.


 
 
 




 
Results of Operations


 
 
 




 
Net income for the second quarter of 2004 amounted to $288 million, compared with $252 million in the second quarter of 2003. Income from
discontinued operations was $7 million in the second quarter of 2004 and $189 million in the second quarter of 2003. Net income for the
first half of 2004 was $569 million compared with $428 million in the first half of 2003, including $7 million and $169 million from
discontinued operations, respectively. The after-tax results by major operating activity for the three- and six-
months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 were as follows (in millions, except per share data):

Comparison of Results
     In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain
transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews
segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in
its analysis of variances in segment earnings. Management believes
that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances
in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather
than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by
applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to
pre-tax amounts.


Exploration and Production
     Exploration and
production earnings from continuing operations
increased by $94 million in the second quarter and $182 million in the
first half of 2004 compared with the corresponding periods of 2003.
Earnings include an after-tax gain of $15 million ($3 million before
income taxes) in the second quarter of 2004 from the sale of a
non-producing property in Malaysia. Earnings for the first six months
of 2004 and 2003 include after-tax gains on asset sales of $33 million
($23 million before income taxes) and $31 million ($47 million before
income taxes), respectively. Earnings also include after-tax charges
of $6 million and $23 million in the second quarters of 2004 and 2003
($10 million and $38 million before income taxes), respectively, for
accrued severance and a reduction in leased office space in London.

     After considering the gains on asset sales and other items
described above, the remaining changes in exploration and production
earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices,
sales volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses, as
discussed below.


     Selling prices: Higher average selling prices of crude oil and
natural gas increased exploration and production revenues by
approximately $100 million in the second quarter and $190 million in
the first six months of 2004 compared with the same periods of 2003.
The Corporation’s average selling prices, including the effects of
hedging, were as follows:

     The after-tax impacts of crude oil and U.S. natural gas hedges
were opportunity costs of $124 million in the second quarter and
$197 million in the first six months of 2004 compared with opportunity costs of $45 million and $147 million in the same periods of the prior year.


     Production and sales volumes: The Corporation’s oil and gas
production, on a barrel of oil equivalent basis, decreased to 349,000
barrels per day in the first half of 2004 from 398,000 barrels per day
in 2003. This decline was primarily due to asset sales and exchanges
in 2003 and natural field decline. The Corporation anticipates that
its average production for the full year of 2004 will be approximately
340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Corporation’s net
daily worldwide production was as follows (in thousands):

Reflects natural gas production converted based on
relative energy content (six Mcf equals one barrel).


     The changes in crude oil and natural gas sales volumes in 2004
compared to the same periods of 2003 resulted in lower income before
income taxes of approximately $30 million for the second quarter and
$50 million for the first half of 2004 compared with the corresponding
periods of 2003.


     Operating costs and exploration expenses: Operating costs and
exploration expenses from continuing operations decreased by
approximately $30 million in the second quarter of 2004 compared with
the corresponding period in the prior year. Exploration expense
decreased in the second quarter of 2004 compared with 2003 primarily
because of lower exploratory drilling activity. Depreciation,
depletion and amortization charges were also lower in the second
quarter of 2004 compared with 2003, reflecting lower production
volumes and lower unit cost per barrel. Production expenses
increased slightly in the second quarter of 2004 primarily reflecting
workovers in the United States and United Kingdom.

PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
Results of Operations (Continued)
     For the first six months of 2004 compared with the same period of
2003, operating costs and exploration expenses from continuing
operations decreased by approximately $120 million. Exploratory
drilling was lower in the first half of 2004, but is expected to be
higher in the second half of the year. Depreciation, depletion and
amortization charges were also lower in the first half of 2004
compared with 2003, reflecting lower production volumes and lower unit
cost per barrel from changes in the mix of producing fields.


     Other: After-tax foreign currency translation resulted in gains
of $11 million ($15 million before income taxes) in the second quarter
of 2004 and gains of $8 million ($2 million before income taxes) in
the first half of 2004 compared with losses of $12 million ($13
million before income taxes) and $13 million ($17 million before
income taxes) in the corresponding periods of 2003. The pre-tax
amounts of foreign currency gains or losses are included in
non-operating income (expense) in the income statement.


     The effective income tax rate for exploration and production
operations in the first half of 2004 was 46% compared to 49% in the
first half of 2003.


     The Corporation’s future exploration and production earnings may
be impacted by volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and
natural gas, reserve and production changes and changes in tax rates.


Refining and Marketing
     Earnings from refining and marketing activities amounted to $160
million in the second quarter of 2004 compared with $46 million in the
corresponding period of 2003. For the first half of 2004, refining
and marketing operations earned $272 million compared with $183
million in 2003. The second quarter of 2003 includes an after-tax
loss on the sale of the Corporation’s interest in a shipping joint
venture of $20 million ($9 million before income taxes).


     The Corporation’s downstream operations include HOVENSA L.L.C.
(HOVENSA), a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), accounted for on the equity
method. Additional refining and marketing activities include a fluid
catalytic cracking facility in Port Reading, New Jersey, as well as
retail gasoline stations, energy marketing and trading operations. In
the second quarter of 2004, the Corporation formed Hess LNG L.L.C., a
joint venture, to pursue investments in liquified natural gas
terminals and related supply, trading and marketing opportunities.


     HOVENSA: The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income was $97
million in the second quarter of 2004 compared with $15 million in
the second quarter of 2003. For the first half of 2004, the
Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income was $148 million compared
with $65 million for the first half of 2003. HOVENSA’s total crude
runs amounted to 492,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2004
and 414,000 barrels per
day in the first half of 2003. Crude runs in the first half of 2004
reflect higher utilization rates as a result of higher refining
margins. In the early part of 2003 crude runs were reduced
reflecting interruptions in crude oil deliveries from Venezuela.

PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
Results of Operations (Continued)
     In the second quarter of 2004, the Corporation began recording
deferred income tax expense in refining and marketing earnings to
reflect the reduction in the deferred tax asset resulting from the
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards associated with the
Corporation’s investment in HOVENSA L.L.C. The amount of the
deferred tax provided was $11 million. It is anticipated that for
the remainder of the year deferred taxes will be provided on HOVENSA
earnings at a rate of approximately 15%. In 2005, it is expected
that deferred taxes will be recorded at the Virgin Islands statutory
rate of 38.5%. As of June 30, the Corporation has approximately $320
million of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset its
share of future HOVENSA taxable income.


     Earnings from refining and marketing activities also include
interest income on the note received from PDVSA at the formation of
the joint venture. Interest on the PDVSA note amounted to $13 million
in the first half of 2004 and $16 million in the same period of 2003.
Interest income is recorded in non-operating income in the income
statement.


     Retail, Energy Marketing and Other: Results of retail gasoline
operations were lower in the second quarter and first half of 2004
compared with the corresponding periods of 2003 reflecting lower
gasoline margins, although sales volumes increased. Energy marketing
earnings were also lower in the second quarter and first half of 2004
due to decreased margins compared with 2003. Results of the Port
Reading refining facility improved in the second quarter and first
half of 2004 reflecting higher margins than in same period of 2003.
Refined product sales volumes were 404,000 barrels per day in the
second quarter of 2004 and 444,000 barrels per day in the first half
of 2004, compared with 399,000 and 431,000 barrels per day in the
corresponding periods of 2003.


     The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
partnership that trades energy commodities and derivatives. The
Corporation also takes trading positions in addition to its hedging
program. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities,
including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership
amounted to income of $18 million ($32 million before income taxes) in
the second quarter and $32 million ($56 million before income taxes)
in the first half of 2004. Trading activities resulted in a loss of
$6 million ($11 million before income taxes) in the second quarter and
income of $12 million ($18 million before income taxes) in the first
half of 2003.

     Refining and marketing earnings will likely continue to be
volatile reflecting competitive industry conditions and supply and
demand factors, including the effects of weather.


Corporate
     After-tax corporate expenses amounted to $24 million in the
second quarter and $26 million in the first half of 2004 compared with
$27 million and $47 million in same periods of 2003. The results for
the first half of 2004 include a non-cash income tax benefit of $13
million resulting from the completion of a prior year United States
income tax audit. After-tax corporate expenses for the remainder of
2004 are estimated to be approximately $18 million per quarter.


Interest
     After-tax interest totaled $37 million in the second quarter of
2004 compared with $44 million in the second quarter of 2003. In the
first half of 2004, after-tax interest amounted to $73 million
compared with $91 million in the first half of 2003. The
corresponding amounts before income taxes were $60 million in the
second quarter of 2004, $77 million in the second quarter of 2003,
$117 million in the first half of 2004 and $151 million in the first
half of 2003. Interest incurred in 2004 was lower than in 2003 due to
lower average outstanding debt. Capitalized interest was $29 million
in the first half of 2004 and $21 million in the first half of 2003.


Discontinued Operations
     Income from discontinued operations of $7 million in the second
quarter of 2004 reflects the settlement of a previously accrued
contingency relating to a foreign exploration and production operation
that was disposed of in 2003.


     In the first quarter of 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude
oil producing properties in Colombia (acquired in 2001 as part of the
Triton acquisition), plus $10 million in cash, for an additional 25%
interest in Block A-18 in the joint development area of Malaysia and
Thailand (JDA). The exchange resulted in an after-tax charge to
income of $59 million in discontinued operations in the first quarter
of 2003.


     In the second quarter of 2003, the Corporation sold Gulf of
Mexico Shelf properties, the Jabung Field in Indonesia and several
small United Kingdom fields for $445 million. An after-tax gain from
these asset sales of $175 million was included in discontinued
operations in the second quarter. Discontinued operations in the
second quarter and first half of 2003 also include $14 million and $53
million, respectively, of income from operations prior to the sales of
these assets.

Sales and Other Operating Revenues
     Sales and other operating revenues increased by 19% in the second
quarter and 11% in the first half of 2004 compared with the
corresponding periods of 2003. This increase principally reflects
higher selling prices and sales volumes of refined products partially
offset by decreased sales of purchased natural gas in energy
marketing. The increase in cost of goods sold also reflects the
change in sales volumes of refined products.


Liquidity and Capital Resources
     Overview: Cash flows from operating activities, including changes
in operating assets and liabilities, totaled $832 million in the first
half of 2004. Cash and short-term investments at June 30, 2004
totaled $611 million, an increase of $93 million from year-end. At
June 30, 2004, the Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio was
41.1% compared to 42.5% at December 31, 2003. Total debt was $3,889
million at June 30, 2004 and $3,941 million at December 31, 2003. The
Corporation has hedged the selling prices of a significant portion of
its crude oil and natural gas production in 2004 and 2005 to help
generate a level of cash flow that will meet operating and capital
commitments.


     Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Net cash provided by
operating activities, including changes in operating assets and
liabilities, totaled $832 million in the first half of 2004 compared
with $1,059 million in the first half of 2003. This change is
primarily due to the timing of cash flows associated with changes in
working capital accounts in 2003.


     Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Capital expenditures in
the first six months of 2004 were $736 million of which $709 million
related to exploration and production activities. Capital
expenditures in the same period of 2003 were $709 million, including
$660 million for exploration and production. Proceeds from asset
sales were $40 million in 2004 and $508 million in 2003.


     Cash Flows from Financing Activities: The Corporation reduced
debt by $52 million during the first half of 2004. Debt reduction in
the first half of 2003 was $350 million. Dividends paid were $106
million in the first half of 2004 compared with $81 million in the
same period of the prior year. The increase was due to dividends on
the 7% preferred stock issued in the fourth quarter of 2003. During
the first six months of 2004, the Corporation received proceeds from
the exercise of stock options totaling $52 million.


     Future Capital Requirements and Resources: Capital expenditures
excluding acquisitions, if any, for the remainder of 2004 are
currently estimated to be approximately $800 million. The Corporation
anticipates that available cash and cash flow from operations will
fund these expenditures. At June 30, 2004, the Corporation had an
undrawn facility of $1.5 billion under its committed revolving credit
agreement and additional unused lines of credit of $78 million under
uncommitted arrangements with banks. The Corporation’s revolving
credit agreement expires in 2006 and the Corporation expects it will
be able to arrange a new committed facility prior to expiration,

Liquidity and Capital Resources(Continued)
if required. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under
which it may issue $825 million of additional debt securities,
warrants, common stock or preferred stock.


     Loan agreement covenants allow the Corporation to borrow an
additional $5.4 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets
at June 30, 2004. At period end, the amount that can be borrowed
under the loan agreements for the payment of dividends is $2.0
billion.


     Prior to June 30, 1986, the Corporation had extensive exploration
and production operations in Libya; however, it was required to
suspend participation in these operations because of U.S. Government
sanctions. The book value of the Corporation’s Libyan assets was
written-off in connection with the cessation of operations. On
February 24, 2004, the Corporation received U.S. Government
authorization to negotiate and enter into an executory agreement with
the government of Libya that would define the terms for resuming
active participation in the Libyan properties. On April 29, 2004, the
U.S. Government lifted most of the sanctions imposed on Libya. It has
also taken the necessary steps to have the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of
1976 terminated by Congress with respect to Libya. As a result, the
Corporation and its partners will be able to resume operations in
Libya if they are able to reach a successful conclusion to ongoing
commercial negotiations. If these negotiations are successful,
management anticipates capital expenditures will likely increase over
the current plan. Production and reserves would also increase.


     Credit Ratings: In the first quarter of 2004, two credit rating
agencies downgraded their ratings of the Corporation’s debt. One of
the revised ratings was below investment grade. Consequently, the
Corporation’s cash margin or collateral requirements under certain
contracts with hedging and trading counterparties and certain lenders
increased. Outstanding letters of credit increased to $678 million at
June 30, 2004 compared with $229 million at December 31, 2003. This
increase relates primarily to higher commodity prices and, to a lesser
extent, the additional collateral required on hedging contracts
because of the lower rating. All hedging and trading counterparty
liabilities are recorded on the balance sheet. If an additional
rating agency were to reduce its credit rating below investment grade,
the incremental margin requirements at June 30, 2004 would be $130
million.


     Other: In connection with the sale of six vessels in 2002, the
Corporation agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate on these
vessels for up to five years. The support agreement requires that if
the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is less than
the stipulated support rate in the agreement, the Corporation will pay
to the buyer the difference between the contracted rate and the
stipulated rate. The balance in the charter support reserve at January
1, 2004 was $32 million. During the first six months of 2004, the
Corporation paid $3 million of charter support, reducing the reserve
to $29 million.


     At December 31, 2003, the Corporation had an accrual of $38
million for severance and leased office space in London. During the
first six months of 2004, $13 million of additional pre-tax costs were
accrued and $10 million of payments were made. The
June 30, 2004 accrual for severance and office lease costs is $41
million. Additional


19

Liquidity and Capital Resources(Continued)
accruals for severance and lease costs of
approximately $25 million before income taxes are anticipated in 2005.


     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Corporation has leveraged
lease financings not included in its balance sheet, primarily related
to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net
present value of these financings is $460 million at June 30, 2004.
The Corporation’s June 30, 2004 debt to capitalization ratio would
increase from 41.1% to 43.9% if the lease financings were included as
debt.


     The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSA’s
crude oil and feedstock purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA.
The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on the
volume of crude oil purchased and related prices. At June 30, 2004,
the guarantee totaled $170 million. In addition, the Corporation has
agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $40 million to the extent
HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations.


     In the first quarter of 2004, the Corporation guaranteed its
share of an investee’s borrowings to finance construction of an oil
pipeline. The amount guaranteed is approximately $39 million. The
guarantee will be in place through the end of the pipeline’s
construction, which is expected to be approximately two years.


Market Risk Disclosure
     In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed
to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil,
natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes
in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures
that follow, these operations are referred to as non-trading
activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally
through a 50% voting interest in a trading partnership. These
activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to
the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products.


     Instruments: The Corporation uses forward commodity contracts,
foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps and options in the
Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are
widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms.

Market Risk Disclosure(Continued)
     Quantitative Measures: The Corporation uses value-at-risk to
monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non-trading
activities. The value-at-risk model uses historical simulation and
the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at
a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second
order sensitivities for options. The potential change in fair value
based on commodity price risk is presented in the non-trading and
trading sections below.


     Non-Trading: The Corporation’s non-trading activities include
hedging of crude oil and natural gas production. Futures and swaps
are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the Corporation’s
future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part
of the Corporation’s selling prices. As of June 30, the Corporation
has open hedge positions equal to 60% of its estimated 2004 worldwide
crude oil production for the period from July 1 to December 31, 2004
and 55% of its estimated 2005 worldwide crude oil production. The
average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) related open
hedge positions is $28.76 in 2004 and $27.18 in 2005. The average
price for Brent crude oil related open hedge positions is $26.33 in
2004 and $26.16 in 2005. Approximately 18% of the Corporation’s
hedges are WTI related and the remainder are Brent. In addition, the
Corporation has 24,000 barrels per day of Brent related crude oil
production hedged from 2006 through 2012 at an average price of $26.20
per barrel. The Corporation also has hedged 10% of its remaining 2004
United States natural gas production at an average price of $6.30 per
Mcf. As market conditions change, the Corporation may adjust its
hedge percentages.


     The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined
petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses
futures and swaps to fix the purchase prices of commodities to be sold
under fixed-price sales contracts.


     The Corporation estimates that at June 30, 2004, the
value-at-risk for commodity related derivatives that are settled in
cash and used in non-trading activities was $89 million ($44 million
at December 31, 2003). The results may vary from time to time as
hedge levels change.


     Trading and Risk Management: The trading partnership in which the
Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy commodities and
derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are consolidated with
those of the Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading
positions for its own account. These strategies include proprietary
position management and trading to enhance the potential return on
assets. The information that follows represents 100% of the trading
partnership and the Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts.


     In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in
crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices, primarily in North
America and Europe. Trading positions include futures, forwards,
swaps and options. In some cases, physical purchase and sale
contracts are used as trading instruments and are included in the
trading results.


     Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at
the time of sale. Derivative trading transactions are marked-to-market
and are reflected in income currently. Total realized gains for the
first six months of 2004 amounted to $104 million
($16 million of realized gains for the first six months of 2003). The
following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting the
changes in fair value of trading activities and represents 100% of the
trading partnership and other trading activities (in millions):

Item 1.

 
Legal Proceedings


 
 
 




 
As disclosed in Registrant’s 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2003 (the Form 10-K), purported class actions
consolidated under a complaint captioned: In re Amerada Hess
Securities Litigation were pending in United States District Court for
the District of New Jersey against Registrant and certain executive
officers and former executive officers of the Registrant alleging that
these individuals sold shares of the Registrant’s common stock in
advance of the Registrant’s acquisition of Triton Energy Limited
(“Triton”) in 2001 in violation of federal securities laws. In April
2003, the Registrant and the other defendants filed a motion to
dismiss for failure to state a claim and failure to plead fraud with
particularity. On March 31, 2004, the court granted the defendants’
motion to dismiss the complaint. The plaintiffs were granted leave to
file an amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in
June 2004. Defendants will continue to defend vigorously these
actions.


 
 
 




 
As also disclosed in the Form 10-K, derivative actions seeking damages
on behalf of Registrant and consolidated under a complaint captioned
In re Amerada Hess Derivative Action, were pending in the Superior
Court in the State of New Jersey against certain executive officers
and former executive officers of the Registrant alleging, among other
things, that the directors breached their fiduciary duties by misusing
material non-public information of Registrant to personally profit
from the sale of Registrant’s common stock in connection with the
Triton acquisition. Registrant and the individual defendants filed
motions to dismiss this action in May 2003 and in May 2004 the
Superior Court dismissed this action for failure to make a demand on
Registrant’s Board of Directors. Plaintiffs were given leave to file
an appeal by July 2004. The time for Plaintiffs to file a notice of
appeal has expired.


 
 
 




 
As also disclosed in the Form 10-K, two class actions based on the
same factual background were commenced in May and August 2003 and
consolidated under a complaint captioned Falk et al. v. Amerada Hess
Corporation in the United States District Court for the District of
New Jersey against certain named executives officers, certain
directors, former directors and certain employees of the Registrant on
behalf of participants in Registrant’s savings and stock bonus plan,
alleging defendants breached their fiduciary duties under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act that resulted in losses to participants
in the plan who held shares of the Registrant’s common stock.
Registrant and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss these
actions in December 2003. The motion to dismiss was denied by the
district court in May 2004. Registrant and the other defendants will
continue to defend vigorously these actions.
