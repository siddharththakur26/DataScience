item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 1998 acquisitions. on march 30, 1998, the company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired approximately 81 of the outstanding shares of common stock of coleman from a subsidiary of m f in exchange for 14,099,749 shares of the company's common stock and approximately 160 million in cash. in addition, the company assumed approximately 1,016 million in debt. immediately afterwards, as a result of the exercise of coleman employee stock options, the company's indirect beneficial ownership of coleman decreased to approximately 79 . the company's agreement for the acquisition of the remaining publicly held coleman shares in a merger transaction provides that the remaining coleman shareholders will receive o approximately 6.7 million shares of sunbeam common stock 0.5677 of a share for each outstanding coleman share and o approximately 87 million in cash 6.44 for each outstanding coleman share and cash outs of unexercised coleman employee stock options equal to the difference between 27.50 per share and the exercise price of the options. the company expects to complete the coleman merger during the second half of 1999, although there can be no assurance that the merger will occur during that time. see notes 2 and 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements and item 1 significant 1998 financial and business developments settlement of coleman related claims for information regarding the settlement of claims relating to the coleman acquisition, the terms of which provide for the issuance at the time of the merger of warrants to purchase up to approximately 4.98 million shares of the company's common stock at 7 per share. on april 6, 1998, the company completed the cash acquisitions of first alert, a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and signature brands, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional products. the first alert and the signature brands acquisitions were valued at approximately 182 million, including 133 million of cash and 49 million of assumed debt, and 255 million, reflecting cash paid, including the required retirement or defeasance of debt, respectively. the acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the financial position and results of operations of each acquired entity are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. the purchase prices of the acquired entities have been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair values determined by independent appraisals at the dates of acquisition. fiscal year to standardize the fiscal period ends of the company and the acquired entities, effective with its 1998 fiscal year, the company has changed its fiscal year end from the sunday nearest december 31 to a calendar year. see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements. asset impairment and other charges goodwill when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, the company estimates future cash flows using the recoverability method undiscounted future cash flows and including related interest charges as a basis for recording any impairment loss. an impairment loss is then recorded to adjust the carrying value of goodwill to the recoverable amount. the impairment loss taken is no greater than the amount by which the carrying value of the net assets of the business exceeds its fair value. due to first alert's financial performance in 1998 and its prospects for 1999 and beyond, the company determined that the goodwill relating to this acquisition was impaired. accordingly, based on its 26 determination of fair value, the company has written off the net carrying value of goodwill of 62.5 million in the fourth quarter of 1998. fixed asset impairment and excess and obsolete inventory reserves in the second quarter of 1998, the company decided to outsource or discontinue a substantial number of products principally breadmakers, toasters and certain other appliances, air and water filtration products and the elimination of certain stock keeping units sku's within existing product lines, primarily relating to appliances, grills and grill accessories previously made by the company, resulting in some facilities and equipment that will either no longer be used or will be utilized in a significantly different manner. accordingly, a charge of 29.6 million was recorded in cost of goods sold to write some of these assets down to their estimated fair market value. approximately 80 of this charge related to machinery, equipment and tooling at the company's mexico city and hattiesburg, mississippi manufacturing plants, the estimated fair value for which was derived through an auction process. the remainder of this charge related to tooling and equipment at various other facilities, which either had a nominal value or the fair market value of which was derived through an auction process. these assets were taken out of service at the time of the write down and consequently were not depreciated further after the write down. the net carrying value of these assets after the write down approximated 2.2 million and these assets are expected to be disposed of by september 30, 1999. depreciation expense associated with these assets approximated 2.6 million in 1998, 4.2 million in 1997 and 3.5 million in 1996. personnel at the mexico city facility were notified in the second quarter of 1998 that the plant was scheduled for closure at year end 1998 accordingly, at that time a liability of 1.8 million was recorded in cost of goods sold primarily for employee severance. the employee severance was related to approximately 1,200 positions of which approximately 1,100 were terminated, and 1.4 million paid in severance, as of december 31, 1998. substantially all of the remaining positions are expected to be eliminated and severance payments made by july 31, 1999. in the third quarter of 1998, the company recorded in cost of goods sold an additional provision for impairment of fixed assets of 3.1 million in an acquired entity relating to assets taken out of service for which there was no remaining value. the asset impairment resulted from management's decision, during the third quarter, to discontinue certain sku's within product lines, principally generators, compressors and propane cylinders. these fixed assets were taken out of service at the time of the write down and consequently were not depreciated further after the write down. depreciation expense associated with these assets approximated 0.8 million in 1998. in the fourth quarter of 1998, the company recorded a 7.1 million charge as a result of management's decision, during the fourth quarter, to outsource the production of some appliances principally irons . this charge to cost of goods sold primarily consists of a provision for certain tooling and equipment 6.7 million and severance and related benefits 0.4 million . this tooling and equipment, which had no remaining value, was written off and depreciation of this equipment was discontinued at the time of the write down. depreciation expense associated with these assets approximated 2.4 million in 1998, 2.3 million in 1997 and 0.9 million in 1996. the severance costs related to approximately 45 production employees, none of whom were terminated as of december 31, 1998. it is anticipated that these employees' positions will be eliminated and the severance obligation paid by september 30, 1999. during 1997 and the first half of 1998, the company built inventories in anticipation of 1998 sales volumes which did not materialize. as a result, it has been and will continue to be necessary to dispose of some portions of excess inventories at amounts less than cost. accordingly, during 1998, when it became evident that the anticipated sales volumes would not materialize, the company recorded 58.2 million in charges of which 46.4 million, 2.2 million and 9.6 million, were recorded during the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively to properly state this inventory at the lower of cost or market. this inventory primarily related to some appliances, grills and grill accessories. the company also recorded a charge of 11.0 million during the second quarter for excess inventories for raw materials and work in process which will not be used due to outsourcing the production of breadmakers, toasters and some other appliances. in addition, during 1998, the company made the decision to exit some product lines, primarily air and water filtration products, and to eliminate some sku's within existing product lines, primarily relating to 27 appliances, grills and grill accessories. as a result of this decision, a 26.6 million charge was recorded during the second quarter to properly state this inventory at the lower of cost or market. total charges for excess inventories recorded at the lower of cost or market, based upon management's best estimate of net realizable value, amounted to approximately 95.8 million at december 31, 1998. see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements for asset impairment and other charges recorded in conjunction with a 1996 restructuring plan. restatements on june 30, 1998, the company announced that the audit committee of its board of directors was initiating a review into the accuracy of the company's prior financial statements. the audit committee's review has since been completed and, as a result of its findings, the company has restated its previously issued consolidated financial statements for 1996 and 1997 and the first quarter of 1998. based upon the review, it was determined that some revenue had been inappropriately recognized, some costs and allowances had not been accrued or were improperly recorded, and some costs were inappropriately included in, and subsequently charged to, restructuring, asset impairment and other costs within the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december 29, 1996 and december 28, 1997 and the three months ended march 31, 1998. the financial statements for the years ended december 28, 1997 and december 29, 1996 were restated, audited and filed on form 10 k a with the sec on november 9, 1998. the accompanying consolidated financial statements present the restated results. in connection with the restatements referred to above, arthur andersen advised sunbeam that it believed there were material weaknesses in sunbeam's internal controls. in order to address these material weaknesses, sunbeam has increased the number of senior financial personnel and has implemented comprehensive review procedures of operating and financial information. additionally, as explained in more detail under year 2000 readiness disclosure within item 7, the company is in the process of significantly enhancing its operating systems. the company anticipates that its systems enhancements will be completed in 1999. year ended december 31, 1998 compared to year ended december 28, 1997 results of operations for the year ended december 31, 1998 include the results of coleman from march 30, 1998 and of signature brands and first alert from april 6, 1998, the respective dates of the acquisitions. the acquired companies generated net sales of 1,009.0 million from the acquisition dates noted above through december 31, 1998, with corresponding gross margin of 205.1 million, or 20 of sales. sg a costs recorded by the acquired companies were 329.9 million in the period, yielding an operating loss of 124.8 million. for the acquired companies, net sales from the dates of the acquisitions through fiscal year end were approximately 152 million lower than the same period in the prior year. this decline was caused by lower net sales at coleman 81.5 million , signature brands 31.2 million and first alert 39.2 million . excluding the effects of coleman's sale of its safety and security business in march 1998 and the discontinuation of its pressure washer business during 1997, coleman's 1998 sales would have been approximately 4 million lower than in 1997. the company believes that signature brands' decline, primarily in its coffee and tea products, resulted largely from lost distribution and insufficient attention to the business during part of 1998. the company believes that all of the acquired businesses were, to some extent, impacted by the disruption that arose from the integration with the company and the related management changes, both at the acquired companies and at the company. first alert's sales decline related predominantly to increased inventory positions in the domestic channel in 1997 as compared to 1998 with the remaining decrease primarily related to more favorable weather conditions in the fourth quarter of 1997 as compared to the same period in 1998 which affected consumer shopping patterns. excluding the effects from purchase accounting and the write off of first alert's goodwill, as discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements, operating profit for these three companies declined by approximately 45 million since the acquisitions in 1998 as compared to the same period in the prior year, resulting primarily from lower net sales. although there can be no assurance, management anticipates that results from 28 the acquired companies will significantly improve during 1999 due to, among other things, the absence of the factors causing disruption and insufficient focus at these three companies during 1998. consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31, 1998 were 1,836.9 million, an increase of 763.8 million versus the year ended december 28, 1997. after excluding o 1,009.0 million of sales generated by the acquired companies o 5.5 million of sales in 1998 resulting from the change in fiscal year end, as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements o 12.7 million in 1998 and 31.3 million in 1997 from sales of excess or discontinued inventory for which the inventory carrying value was substantially equivalent to the sales value o 4.2 million from 1997 sales relating to divested product lines which are not classified as discontinued operations time and temperature products and counselor and borg branded scales and o a 5.4 million benefit in 1997 from the reduction of cooperative advertising accruals no longer required cooperative advertising costs are recorded as deductions in determining net sales net sales on an adjusted basis adjusted sales of 809.7 million in 1998 decreased approximately 22 from adjusted sales of 1,032.2 million in 1997. product sales were adversely impacted by a number of factors, with the largest being changes in retail inventory levels from channel loading which took place in 1997. sunbeam believes the year to year effect of these inventory reductions amounted to over 100 million. additionally, losses in distribution of outdoor cooking products estimated at approximately 60 million, the estimated effect of price discounting on appliance and grill products of approximately 14 million, and estimated higher provisions for customer returns and allowances of approximately 30 million contributed to the lower sales in 1998. the increase in customer returns and allowances resulted from o increased returns of approximately 16 million principally resulting from channel loading and other aggressive sales practices estimated at approximately 9 million which began in the fourth quarter of 1997 and continued in the first quarter of 1998, a blanket recall 3.0 million and the discontinuance of certain product lines approximately 4 million principally air and water products and o additional customer allowances of approximately 14 million primarily to induce sales during the first quarter of 1998. the remaining sales decline was due in part to exiting some product sku's. domestic adjusted sales declined approximately 21 or 170 million from 1997. the company believes more than half of the sales decline was due to increased retail inventory levels in 1997 versus decreased inventory positions at customers in 1998. excluding this effect, sales were still lower than the prior year throughout the business, with the most significant decline occurring in outdoor cooking products sales. during 1997, the company lost a significant portion of its outdoor cooking products distribution, including the majority of its grill parts and accessories products distribution. the outdoor cooking products sales decline was attributable predominantly to this lost distribution and to price discounting. the majority of the remaining sales decline was due to higher provisions for customer returns and allowances. international adjusted sales, which represented 22 of adjusted sales for 1998, decreased approximately 24 compared with the international adjusted sales for the same period a year ago. the company believes this sales decline was primarily attributable to decreasing customer inventory levels as compared with the prior year. sales were also adversely impacted by a decision to stop selling to some export distributors in latin america and by poor economic conditions in that region. in addition, lost distribution in canada contributed to the sales decline from the prior year. 29 excluding the effects of o the gross margin generated from the inclusion of the acquired companies' operations in the period of 205.1 million o 0.8 million from the impact of the change in fiscal year end o 128.4 million in 1998 in charges recorded in the second and fourth quarters related to excess inventory and fixed assets impairments o 15.8 million from the benefit in 1997 from the reversal of reserves no longer required, including 5.4 million of cooperative advertising accruals and o a 2.8 million benefit recorded in the second quarter of 1997 resulting from capitalizing some manufacturing supplies inventories which were previously expensed there was a negative gross margin of 29.4 million for 1998 versus a gross margin of 223.5 million for 1997. this reduction in gross margin was principally attributable to the following o approximately 145 million related to lower sales volume and unfavorable manufacturing efficiencies resulting from lower production levels associated with the lower sales volumes and high inventory levels in 1998 o approximately 65 million related to lower price realization, higher costs of customer returns and allowances, and adverse sales mix in 1998 o approximately 12 million related to higher costs in 1998 associated with warranty, of which 3.0 million related to a blanket recall, with the remaining increase attributable to increased provisions in response to higher overall warranty expense experience and o approximately 20 million related to unfavorable inventory adjustments, of which the most significant single factor was physical inventory adjustments in the domestic business. adverse product sales mix was due in part to the loss of a majority of the grill accessory products distribution as accessories generate significantly better margins than the average margins on sales of most of the company's other products. excluding the effects of the following, sg a expenses were approximately 254 million in 1998, approximately 105 million, or 70 , higher than in 1997 o 329.9 million of sg a charges in the acquired companies, including the 62.5 million goodwill write off related to first alert o 70.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 1998 related to the issuance of a warrant to a subsidiary of macandrews forbes, as discussed below o 2.3 million of sg a expense in 1998 from the change in the fiscal period o a 3.0 million benefit in 1998 and a 12.1 million benefit in 1997 from the reversal of reserves no longer required. the 1998 benefit consists of a 3.0 million reversal in the first quarter of 1998 of environmental reserves which are no longer required as a result of a favorable development at a remediation site. the 1997 benefit consists primarily of a 8.1 million reversal of litigation reserves, established in 1996, which were no longer required in the fourth quarter of 1997 due to a favorable settlement during 1997. the remaining 4.0 million 1997 benefit consists of reversals of other accruals primarily relating to consulting fees, health insurance and advertising. for further information see note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements and further in this management's discussion and analysis 30 o approximately 31 million of 1998 compensation expense recorded in connection with new february 1998 employment agreements with sunbeam's former chairman and chief executive officer and two other former senior officers and approximately 3 million of severance in 1998 for some former employees. the new employment agreements provided for sunbeam to pay these former employees amounts which reimbursed them for their personal tax liabilities resulting from shares issued in connection with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock granted under their july 1996 agreements 6.9 million , as well as on the new unrestricted stock grants under the february 1998 agreements 9.8 million . the charge also includes the value, at approximately 39 per share, of 300,000 restricted shares and 45,000 restricted shares which vested in february 1998 for sunbeam's then chairman and chief executive officer and two other then senior officers, respectively 13.6 million . in addition, 0.4 million was expensed during 1998 relating to the amortization of the 1996 restricted stock awards. see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the terms of these employment agreements o 20.4 million, 6.1 million, and 4.0 million of costs recorded in 1998 related to costs associated with the restatement efforts, principally representing legal, accounting and auditing, and consulting costs of 14.1 million, 5.7 million and 0.6 million, respectively, year 2000 compliance efforts and a corporate office relocation, respectively and o 15.8 million of restructuring related charges recorded in 1997, charged to operations as incurred, represent employee relocation and recruiting 6.2 million , equipment relocation and installation 5.6 million and package redesign costs 4.0 million . the increase of approximately 105 million in sg a expense in 1998 over 1997 is principally due to several factors o corporate administrative costs increased by approximately 47 million, reflecting additional personnel and related relocation, travel and other costs, as well as increased outside provider fees, telecommunications expense and insurance. o higher allowances for accounts receivable in 1998, accounting for approximately 20 million of the increase, related primarily to collection issues with customers in the united states and in latin america, including several major customers who have filed and or threatened bankruptcy. o advertising, marketing and selling expenses increased by approximately 13 million, reflecting a national television campaign for grills and increased activity in market research, package design and sales efforts. higher inventory levels in 1998 and costs associated with outsourcing small parts fulfillment led to higher distribution and warehousing costs of approximately 12 million. o increased environmental reserves for divested and closed facilities added approximately 5 million. approximately half of the environmental reserve increase reflected revisions to estimates of costs to remediate existing sites. these revisions were based on obtaining additional information in the fourth quarter of 1998 about costs of planned remediation actions and costs associated with additional remediation actions. the remaining amount was to provide for revisions to reserves for estimated losses for damages related to environmental sites. these revisions were based on obtaining additional information in the fourth quarter of 1998 regarding the level of damages sought and the costs and probability of defending the company's position in these actions. o settlement of a patent infringement action resulted in additional expense of approximately 4 million. remaining legal expenses recorded in the year of approximately 1 million for investigation, defense and settlement of both new and previously existing issues were nearly equal to amounts incurred for similar items in 1997. additionally, as described above, sg a includes 14.1 million of legal costs recorded in 1998 associated with the restatement efforts. amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs damages and or settlement amounts in connection with pending litigation and claims and related anticipated legal fees. the costs are accrued when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably 31 estimated. the accruals are based upon the company's assessment, after consultation with counsel, of probable loss based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature of the claim made, the nature of the damages sought and any relevant information about the plaintiff, and other significant factors which vary by case. when it is not possible to estimate a specific expected amount of loss to be incurred, the company evaluates the range of possible losses and records the minimum end of the range. as of december 31, 1998 and december 28, 1997, the company had established accruals for litigation matters of 31.2 million representing 17.5 million and 13.7 million for estimated damages or settlement amounts and legal fees, respectively and 9.9 million representing 3.0 million and 6.9 million for estimated damages or settlement amounts and legal fees, respectively , respectively. it is anticipated that the 31.2 million accrual will be paid as follows 22.4 million in 1999, 7.5 million in 2000, and 1.3 million in 2001. the company believes, based on information known to it on december 31, 1998, that anticipated probable costs of litigation matters existing as of december 31, 1998 have been adequately reserved to the extent determinable. during 1997, the company determined that the amounts accrued at december 29, 1996 for restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal 1996 exceeded amounts ultimately required. accordingly, the 1997 consolidated statement of operations reflects the reversal of accruals no longer required, resulting in a restructuring and asset impairment benefit of 14.6 million. this reversal was reflected in the third 5.8 million and fourth 8.8 million quarters of 1997 when it became evident that such accruals were no longer required. on august 12, 1998, the company announced that, following investigation and negotiation conducted by a special committee of the board of directors consisting of four outside directors not affiliated with m f, the company had entered into a settlement agreement with a subsidiary of m f, pursuant to which the company was released from certain threatened claims of m f and its affiliates arising from the coleman acquisition and m f agreed to provide certain management personnel and assistance to the company in exchange for the issuance to the m f subsidiary of a warrant expiring august 2003 to purchase up to 23 million shares of the company's common stock at a cash exercise price of 7.00 per share, subject to antidilution adjustments. the company concluded that the agreement to issue this warrant did not result in a new measurement date for the purposes of determining the purchase price for coleman and has accounted for the issuance of this warrant as a cost of settling a potential claim. accordingly, a 70.0 million non cash sg a expense was recorded in the third quarter of 1998, based on a valuation performed as of august 1998 using facts existing at that time. the valuation was conducted by an independent consultant engaged by the special committee of the board of directors. operating results for 1998 and 1997, on an adjusted basis as described above, were a loss of approximately 283 million in 1998 and a profit of approximately 74 million in 1997. this change resulted from the factors discussed above. interest expense increased from 11.4 million for the twelve months of 1997 to 131.1 million for the same period in 1998. approximately 70 of the change related to higher borrowing levels in 1998 for the acquisitions, with the remainder due to increased borrowings to fund working capital, capital expenditures and the operating losses. other income, net increased in 1998 by 4.8 million due to approximately 8 million from the settlement of a lawsuit, and approximately 4 million of increased net gains from foreign exchange in the period. the foreign exchange net gains were primarily from mexico. increased losses on sales of fixed assets of approximately 5 million and increased expenses related to the bank credit facility partially offset the above mentioned income. the increased credit facility expenses largely related to unused facility fees. the minority interest reported in 1998 relates to the minority interest held in coleman by public shareholders. during 1998, the current tax provision arose largely from taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries as well as franchise taxes. deferred tax benefits were recognized in 1998 principally due to net operating losses 32 incurred subsequent to the acquisitions. these benefits were realized through the use of deferred tax credits that were established in connection with the acquisitions to the extent that such credits are expected to be realized in the loss carryforward period. throughout 1998, the company increased the income tax valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to 290.5 million. this increase reflects management's assessment that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized through future taxable income. this assessment, which was initially made in the fourth quarter of 1997, resulted from the significant leverage undertaken by the company in connection with its acquisitions and the continuing decline in the company's net sales and earnings, as well as the operating losses incurred throughout the 1998 year. the 1997 effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state taxes, the effects of foreign earnings and dividends taxed at other rates and the impact of providing a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. in 1998, the company prepaid debt assumed in the acquisitions and prepaid an industrial revenue bond related to its hattiesburg facility. the debt assumed in connection with the coleman acquisition was repaid as a result of the requirements under the terms of the company's new credit facility. in connection with these early extinguishments of debt, the company recognized an extraordinary charge of 122.4 million, consisting of redemption premiums 106.9 million , unamortized debt discount 13.8 million and unamortized deferred financing costs 1.7 million . the company's discontinued furniture business, which was sold in march 1997, had revenues of 51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the sale and nominal earnings for that period. as a result of the sale of the company's furniture business assets primarily inventory, property, plant and equipment , the company received 69.0 million in cash, retained approximately 50 million in accounts receivable and retained some liabilities. the final purchase price for the furniture business was subject to a post closing adjustment based on the terms of the sale agreement and in the first quarter of 1997, after completion of the sale, the company recorded an additional loss on disposal of 14.0 million net of applicable income tax benefits of 8.5 million. year ended december 28, 1997 compared to year ended december 29, 1996 1996 restructuring plan and other charges and benefits in november 1996, the company announced the details of a restructuring plan. the plan included o the consolidation of administrative functions o the reduction of manufacturing and warehouse facilities o the centralization of the company's procurement function o the reduction of the company's product offerings and skus and o the elimination of some businesses and product lines. as part of the restructuring plan, the company consolidated six divisional and regional headquarters functions into a single worldwide corporate headquarters and outsourced some back office activities resulting in a reduction in total back office administrative headcount. overall, the restructuring plan called for a reduction in the number of production facilities from 26 to 8 and the elimination of over 6,000 positions from the company's workforce, including 3,300 from the disposition of some business operations and the elimination of approximately 2,800 other positions, some of which were outsourced. the company completed the major phases of the restructuring plan by july 1997. the 1996 restructuring plan was unable to improve earnings over the long term for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, its failure to realize some of the anticipated costs savings and the negative impact that implementation of the restructuring plan had on sales, product quality, customer service, research and development and the introduction of new products. the company's current strategy is to create 33 innovative new products that anticipate consumer needs, develop effective marketing and advertising programs, build relationships, create the right culture and choose the right people. in conjunction with the implementation of the restructuring plan, the company recorded a pre tax charge of 239.2 million in the fourth quarter of 1996. this amount is recorded as follows in the consolidated statements of operations o 110.1 million recorded in restructuring and asset impairment charges, as further described below o 60.8 million in cost of goods sold related principally to inventory write downs to net realizable value as a result of a reduction in sku's and costs of inventory liquidation programs o 10.1 million in sg a expense, for period costs, which were charged to operations as incurred, principally relating to employee relocation and recruiting, equipment relocation and installation 3.2 million , transitional fees relating to outsourcing arrangements 4.9 million and package redesign costs 2.0 million and o 58.2 million 39.1 million net of taxes in loss on sale of discontinued operations related to the divestiture of its furniture business. in 1997, upon completion of the sale of the furniture business, the company recorded an additional pre tax loss of 22.5 million from discontinued operations 14.0 million net of taxes due primarily to lower than anticipated sales proceeds relating to the post closing adjustment that was part of the sale agreement. amounts included in restructuring and asset impairment charges in 1996 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations included anticipated cash charges such as severance and other employee costs of 24.7 million, lease obligations of 12.6 million and other exit costs associated with facility closures and related to the implementation of the restructuring plan of 4.1 million, principally representing costs related to clean up and restoration of owned and leased facilities for either sale or return to the landlord. included in restructuring and asset impairment charges of 110.1 million in 1996 was 68.7 million of non cash charges principally consisting of o asset write downs to net realizable value of 22.5 million for disposals of excess facilities and equipment and product lines o write offs of redundant computer systems of 12.3 million from the administrative back office consolidations and outsourcing initiatives o write off of intangibles of 10.1 million relating to discontinued product lines o write off of capitalized product and package design costs and other expenses of 9.0 million related to exited product lines and sku reductions. prior to 1996, the company had capitalized certain costs related to international product development and package design, which were amortized over the period of related benefit. the product development costs 1.9 million related to international operations and represented the costs necessary to modify products for introduction to the international markets. as the restructuring plan included the closure of the international group office and elimination of a number of products to which these costs pertained, the related capitalized costs were written off. additionally, in connection with the restructuring plan, as a result of the elimination of many products and sku's, the company updated its package designs. accordingly, the unamortized balance of the capitalized package design costs which had been capitalized prior to 1996 5.0 million was written off. the company discontinued incurring costs of a significant nature relating to these items and consequently has discontinued capitalizing such costs subsequent to 1995 and o asset write downs of 14.8 million related to the divestiture of some non core products and businesses. 34 the asset write downs of 22.5 million and write offs of 12.3 million discussed above included equipment taken out of service in 1996 either abandoned in 1996 or sold in 1997 and, accordingly, depreciation was not recorded subsequent to the date of the impairment charge. the asset write downs of 14.8 million related to the divestiture of non core products and businesses resulted from divesting the time and temperature business in march 1997 and counselor and borg scale product lines in may 1997 and the sale of the textile mill in biddeford, maine in may 1997. these charges primarily represented the estimated non cash losses resulting from the sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment, based on the estimated net proceeds from the sale of these assets compared to their recorded net book value, related to exiting these product lines. the 24.7 million for severance and other employee costs, including cobra and other fringe benefits, related to approximately 3,700 positions that were planned to be eliminated as a result of the restructuring plan, excluding approximately 2,400 employees terminated from the furniture business for which severance was included in loss on sale of discontinued operations. see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the furniture business was sold in 1997. in 1996 and 1997, approximately 1,200 employees and 1,800 employees, respectively, were terminated from continuing operations. due largely to attrition, the remaining planned terminations were not required. in 1997, the company determined that its severance and employee benefit costs were less than originally accrued principally due to lower than expected cobra and workers compensation costs and, accordingly, reversed accruals of 7.9 million in the third 2.1 million and fourth 5.8 million quarters. at december 31, 1997, the balance accrued of 1.2 million represented the remaining severance and employee benefit costs for some employees terminated during 1997. during 1998, all amounts were expended. the amounts accrued at december 29, 1996 for restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal 1996, exceeded amounts ultimately required principally due to reductions in anticipated severance and employee benefit costs of 7.9 million, as discussed above, and reductions in estimated lease payments of 6.7 million 3.7 million and 3.0 million recognized in the third and fourth quarters, respectively resulting from better than anticipated rentals received under sub leases and favorable negotiation of lease terminations. accordingly, the fiscal 1997 consolidated statement of operations included 14.6 million of benefit 5.8 million in the third quarter and 8.8 million in the fourth quarter of 1997 related to the reversal of accruals no longer required, which were recorded as these reduced obligations became known. in 1996, in conjunction with the initiation of the restructuring plan, the company recorded additional charges totaling 129.1 million, reflected in cost of goods sold, sg a expense, and loss on sale of discontinued operations. the charge included in cost of goods sold of 60.8 million principally represented inventory write downs to net realizable value and anticipated losses on the disposition of the inventory as a result of the significant reduction in sku's provided for in the restructuring plan. the write down to net realizable value, based upon management's best estimates, included 26.9 million related to raw materials, work in process and finished goods for discontinued outdoor cooking products, principally grills and grill accessories and the balance related to raw materials, work in process and finished goods for other discontinued products including appliances 27.8 million , clippers 1.0 million and blankets 5.1 million . for inventory which management determined was saleable, the estimated write down was based upon the difference between the expected net sales proceeds of the inventory, depending upon distribution channel, and the recorded value of the inventory. in the case of abandoned inventory, the write down was equal to the recorded value of the inventory. the resulting difference between carrying value and estimated net realizable value represented the 60.8 million write down necessary to record the inventory at its net realizable value. sg a expense included period costs, charged to operations as incurred, in 1997 and 1996 of 15.8 million and 10.1 million, respectively, relating to employee relocation and recruiting and equipment installation and relocation 11.8 million in 1997 and 3.2 million in 1996 transitional fees relating to outsourcing arrangements 4.9 million in 1996 , and package redesign costs 4.0 million in 1997 and 2.0 million in 1996 expended as a result of the implementation of the restructuring plan. the 1996 loss on sale of discontinued operations related to the divestiture of the company's furniture business. in 1996, the company decided to divest its furniture operations and recorded an estimated pre tax loss of 58.2 million related to the sale of assets, primarily fixed assets and inventory. in 1997, the company recorded an additional pre tax loss of 22.5 million due primarily to lower than anticipated sales proceeds resulting from the post closing adjustment as provided for in the sale agreement. see notes 12 and 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements. 35 at december 28, 1997, the company had 5.2 million in liabilities accrued related to the 1996 restructuring plan, including 1.2 million of severance related costs and 4.0 million related to facility closures, which principally represented future lease payments, net of sub leases, on exited facilities. during 1998, this liability was reduced by 4.0 million as a result of cash expenditures. at december 28, 1997, the company had 3.0 million of warranty liabilities related to the discontinued furniture operations. during 1998, 2.5 million of this liability was liquidated. the charges and benefit described above are included in the following categories in the 1997 and 1996 consolidated statements of operations in millions 1997 1996 restructuring and impairment benefit charge 14.6 110.1 cost of goods sold 60.8 selling, general and administrative expense 15.8 10.1 loss on sale of discontinued operations 22.5 58.2 23.7 239.2 these charges and benefit consisted of the following in millions 1997 1996 write downs fixed assets held for disposal, not in use 34.8 fixed assets held for disposal, used until disposed 14.8 inventory on hand 60.8 other assets, principally trademarks and intangible assets 19.1 129.5 restructuring accruals including amounts expended in 1996 employee severance pay and fringes 7.9 24.7 lease payments and termination fees 6.7 12.6 other exit activity costs, principally facility closure expenses 4.1 14.6 41.4 other related period costs, charged to operations as incurred employee relocation equipment relocation and installation and other 11.8 3.2 transitional fees related to outsourcing arrangements 4.9 package redesign 4.0 2.0 15.8 10.1 charges included in continuing operations 1.2 181.0 loss on sale of discontinued operations 22.5 58.2 23.7 239.2 at december 29, 1996, the net realizable value of the remaining inventory written down as part of the restructuring and asset impairment charges was approximately 37.3 million. during 1997, this inventory, a portion of which was product of discontinued operations, was sold for amounts substantially equivalent to its net carrying value. as further discussed in note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements, during the fourth quarter of 1996, the company charged sg a for increases of 9.0 million in environmental reserves and 12.0 million in litigation reserves. in the fourth quarter of 1996, the company performed a comprehensive review of all environmental exposures in an attempt by the then new senior management team to accelerate the resolution and settlement of environmental claims. as a result, upon the conclusion of the review, the company recorded additional environmental reserves of 9.0 million in the fourth quarter of 1996. the litigation charge of 12.0 million was recorded due to an unfavorable court ruling in january 1997, which held that the company was liable for environmental remediation costs related to the operations of a successor company. as a result of this ruling, the company provided for this liability in the fourth quarter of 1996. in 36 the fourth quarter of 1997, this case was settled and, as a result, 8.1 million of the charge was reversed into income, primarily in the fourth quarter of 1997. as described in note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements, the company also charged 7.7 million to sg a expenses in 1996 for compensation costs associated with restricted stock awards and other costs related to the employment of the then new senior management team. during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 1997, approximately 0.5 million, 4.5 million, 1.5 million and 21.5 million, respectively, of pre tax liabilities provided in prior years and determined to be no longer required were reversed and taken into income. these amounts were primarily related to o the litigation reserve of 8.1 million discussed above, resulting in a reduction in sg a expenses o inventory valuation allowances of 7.0 million, resulting in a reduction in cost of goods sold o cooperative advertising allowances of 5.4 million, resulting in an increase in net sales o liabilities for exiting of facilities and plant consolidations provided for prior to 1996 of 3.5 million, resulting in a decrease in cost of goods sold and o consulting fee accruals of 1.3 million, which resulted in a decrease in sg a expenses. these liabilities were provided for by the company, principally in 1996, based upon its best available estimate at the time of the probable liabilities. when information became available that the amounts provided were in excess of what was required, the company reduced the applicable reserves and recorded increases in net sales of 5.4 million, reductions in cost of goods sold of 10.5 million and reductions in sg a expenses of 12.1 million. additionally, effective in the second quarter of fiscal 1997, the company changed its method of accounting to capitalize manufacturing supplies inventories, whereas, previously these inventories were charged to operations when purchased. this change reduced cost of goods sold in fiscal 1997 by 2.8 million. results of operations for 1997 compared to 1996 net sales for 1997 were 1,073.1 million, an increase of 88.9 million or 9 over 1996. after excluding the following, adjusted sales increased 8 over the prior year to 1,032.2 million from 953.4 million in 1996 o 4.2 million and 30.8 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively, related to divested product lines which were not classified as discontinued operations time and temperature products, decorative bedding and counselor and borg branded scales o 31.3 million of sales in 1997 of discontinued inventory which resulted primarily from the reduction of sku's as part of the 1996 restructuring plan and for which the inventory carrying value was substantially equivalent to the sales value and o a 5.4 million benefit from the reduction of cooperative advertising accruals no longer required in 1997. adjusted sales, on a worldwide basis, increased during 1997 primarily from new product introductions, expanded distribution, particularly with sunbeam's top ten customers, international geographic expansion and increased inventory positions at some customers. adjusted sales growth was approximately 19 for appliances and approximately 12 in outdoor cooking. adjusted sales for health products increased approximately 5 while adjusted sales of personal care products and blankets decreased approximately 13 during 1997. sales increases in appliances of approximately 69 million were driven by new products, such as redesigned blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons, deep fryers and toasters, and by increased distribution with large national mass retailers, combined with higher inventory levels at some customers. sales of outdoor cooking products increased approximately 30 million in 1997 attributed to increased merchandising and advertising programs, new distribution and higher inventory levels at some customers. during 1997, the company lost a significant portion of its outdoor cooking products distribution, including the majority of its grill accessory products distribution. accessories, which accounted for just over 10 of the outdoor cooking 37 sales volume in 1997, generate significantly better margins than the average margins on sales of grills. these distribution changes are expected to adversely impact outdoor cooking sales and margins in the future, until such time as the distribution is regained. sales of personal care products and blankets suffered during the fourth quarter of 1997 as a result of lower than expected retail sell through of electric blankets in key northern markets in late 1997 coupled with the inability to service demand for king and queen sized blankets due to shortages of blanket shells. the company shifted to a more level production for blankets in 1998 in order to more adequately service the seasonal demand for bedding products. sales of health products as well as personal care and bedding products were impacted by increased inventory positions at customers in 1997. international sales, which represented 21 of total revenues in 1997, grew 25 during the year. this sales growth was driven primarily by 54 new 220 volt product introductions and a general improvement in demand in export operations and in mexico. net sales growth of approximately 35 was achieved in the latin american export sales organization. most of this growth came from increased business with three exporters. in mexico and venezuela, sales grew 30 and 24 , respectively. canada accounted for the majority of the remaining international sales growth. excluding the effects of o charges of 60.8 million to cost of goods sold related to the restructuring plan in 1996 o the 15.9 million benefit of reducing reserves no longer required in 1997 and o the 2.8 million benefit in 1997 of capitalizing manufacturing supplies inventories gross margin as a percent of adjusted sales would have been approximately 22 in 1997, an improvement of approximately 6 percentage points from 16 in 1996. this increase reflects the results of lower overhead spending, improved factory utilization and labor cost benefits resulting from the company's restructuring plan, coupled with reductions in materials costs. the lower overhead spending resulted from a reduction in the number of facilities operated by the company. with fewer facilities used for production purposes, the capacity of the remaining plants was more fully utilized. the labor cost benefits were realized principally from shifting production to mexico. in addition, a broad based program to obtain lower costs for materials contributed to the 1997 margin improvement. excluding the impact of o the restructuring and asset impairment period costs to sg a expense of 15.8 million in 1997 and 10.1 million in 1996 o the 1996 charges for the environmental accrual of 9.0 million, litigation accrual of 12.0 million and restricted stock grant compensation of 7.7 million and o the 1997 benefit from the reversal of reserves no longer required of 12.1 million sg a improved to 14 of adjusted sales in 1997, down 5 percentage points from 19 in 1996. this improvement was partially the result of benefits from the consolidation of six divisional and regional headquarters into one corporate headquarters and one administrative operations center, reduced staffing levels, a reduction in the number of warehouses, and company wide cost control initiatives. higher expenditures in 1996 for market research, new packaging and other discretionary charges and higher bad debt expenses associated with some of the company's customers also contributed to the decrease in sg a expense from 1996 to 1997. the expense for doubtful accounts and cash discounts was 17.3 million in 1997 as compared to 27.1 million in 1996. the principal factor in the decrease in bad debt expenses during this period was the acceleration of the consolidation of the u.s. retail industry and the related competitive environment, which resulted in a number of troubled retailers and related bankruptcies during 1996. this resulted in the significant amount of bad debt write offs 19.9 million in 1996. the restructuring accrual, which existed at january 1, 1996 13.8 million , was initially established as part of a rightsizing program during fiscal 1992. during 1996, approximately 3 million of this accrual was utilized and the remaining 10.8 million became part of the reserve requirements of the 1996 restructuring plan. in effect, in 1996, sunbeam reversed the 10.8 million prior year accrual determined to be no longer required and provided a corresponding amount in connection with the 1996 restructuring charge. 38 operating results for 1997 and 1996, on a comparable basis as described above, were earnings of 74.5 million in 1997 and a loss of 34.8 million in 1996. on the same basis, operating margin increased 11 percentage points to 7 of adjusted sales in 1997 versus a loss of 4 in 1996. this improvement resulted from the factors discussed above. interest expense decreased from 13.6 million in 1996 to 11.4 million in 1997 primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in 1997. the 1997 effective income tax rate for continuing operations was higher than the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state taxes plus the effect of foreign earnings and dividends taxed at other rates and the increase to the valuation reserve for deferred tax assets, offset in part by the reversal of tax liabilities no longer required. during the fourth quarter of 1997, approximately 13.3 million of tax liabilities related to the 1993 and 1994 tax years were determined to be no longer required and were reversed and taken into income. these accruals were no longer required because during the fourth quarter of 1997 the company reached a resolution with the internal revenue service on its audits of the 1993 and 1994 tax years. additionally, in the fourth quarter of 1997, the company increased the valuation allowance by 23.2 million reflecting management's assessment that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized through future taxable income. of this amount, 18.9 million related to deferred tax assets, the majority of which was recognized as a benefit in the first three quarters of 1997. the remainder related to minimum pension liabilities and was therefore recorded as an adjustment to shareholders' equity. this assessment was made as a result of the significant leverage incurred by the company to finance the acquisitions and the significant decline in net sales and earnings from anticipated levels during the fourth quarter of 1997 and the first quarter of 1998. for 1996, the effective income tax rate for continuing operations equaled the federal statutory income tax rate. the company's diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 0.60 per share in 1997 versus a loss per share from continuing operations in 1996 of 2.05. the company's share base utilized in the diluted earnings per share calculation increased approximately 6 during 1997 as a result of an increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding due to the exercise of stock options in 1997 and the inclusion of common stock equivalents in the 1997 calculation. the company's discontinued furniture business, which was sold in march 1997, had revenues of 51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the sale and nominal earnings. in 1996, the discontinued furniture business had net income of 0.8 million on revenues of 227.5 million and an estimated loss on disposal of the business of 39.1 million, net of applicable income tax benefits. the sale of the company's furniture business assets primarily inventory, property, plant and equipment was completed in march 1997. the company received 69.0 million in cash, retained approximately 50.0 million in accounts receivable and retained some liabilities related to the furniture business. the final purchase price for the furniture business was subject to a post closing adjustment under the terms of the sale agreement, and in the first quarter of 1997, after completion of the sale, the company recorded an additional pre tax loss on disposal of 22.5 million. although the discontinued furniture business was profitable, net income had declined from 21.7 million in 1994 to 0.8 million in 1996. this decline, along with the company's announcement that it intended to divest this line of business contributed to the loss on the sale. see discussion of restructuring and asset impairment benefit charges in note 12 and discontinued operations in note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding sale of the furniture business. 39 summary of loss earnings from continuing operations a reconciliation of operating loss earnings

losses and 1997 continuing operations are marginally profitable. due to a variety of factors, including increased inventory positions at some customers and manufacturing and sourcing activities during 1997 and the first half of 1998 which increased the company's inventory position, the results for each of 1998 and 1997 are not indicative of future results. results for 1999 are expected to be impacted by the continuing effects of the company's excess inventory position, as well as costs related to year 2000 compliance efforts. foreign operations approximately 80 of the company's business is conducted in u.s. dollars, including domestic sales, u.s. dollar denominated export sales, primarily to latin american markets, asian sales and the majority of european sales. the company's non u.s. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries in europe, canada, japan, latin america and mexico. mexico reverted to a hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997 therefore, translation adjustments related to mexican net monetary assets are included as a component of net loss earnings. mexico is no longer considered hyperinflationary as of january 1, 1999. this change in mexico's hyperinflationary status is not expected to have a material effect on the company's financial results. translation adjustments resulting from the company's non u.s. denominated subsidiaries have not had a material impact on the company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. while revenues generated in asia have traditionally not been significant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negative effect on earnings. economic instability and the political environment in latin america have also affected sales in that region. it is anticipated that sales in and exports to these regions will continue to decline so long as the economic environments in those regions remain unsettled. on a limited basis, the company selectively uses derivatives foreign exchange option and forward contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures that arise in the normal course of business. no derivative 40 contracts are entered into for trading or speculative purposes. the use of derivatives has not had a material impact on the company's financial results. see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements. exposure to market risk qualitative information the company uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its foreign currency and interest rate exposures. the company does not speculate on interest rates or foreign currency rates. instead, it uses derivatives when implementing its risk management strategies to reduce the possible effects of these exposures. with respect to foreign currency exposures, the company is most vulnerable to changes in rates between the united states dollar japanese yen, canadian dollar, german deutschemark, mexican peso and venezuelan bolivar exchange rates. the company principally uses forward and option contracts to reduce risks arising from firm commitments, intercompany sales transactions and intercompany receivable and payable balances. the company generally uses interest rate swaps to fix some of its variable rate debt. the company manages credit risk related to these derivative contracts through credit approvals, exposure limits and threshold amounts and other monitoring procedures. quantitative information below are tables of information related to the company's investments in market risk sensitive instruments. all of the instruments in the

between their existing currencies and the european union's common currency the euro . the transition period for the introduction of the euro is between january 1, 1999 and january 1, 2002. the company has been preparing for the introduction of the euro and continues to evaluate and address the many issues 42 involved, including the conversion of information technology systems, recalculating currency risk, strategies concerning continuity of contracts, and impacts on the processes for preparing taxation and accounting records. based on the work to date, the company believes the euro conversion will not have a material impact on its results of operations. seasonality sunbeam's consolidated sales are not expected to exhibit substantial seasonality however, sales are expected to be strongest during the second quarter of the calendar year. furthermore, sales of a number of products, including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers, grills, first alert products, camping and generator products may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions. liquidity and capital resources debt instruments in order to finance the acquisition of coleman, first alert and signature brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of sunbeam and the three acquired companies, the company consummated an offering of debentures at a yield to maturity of 5 approximately 2,014 million principal amount at maturity in march 1998, which resulted in approximately 730 million of net proceeds and borrowed about 1,325 million under its new bank credit facility. the debentures are exchangeable for shares of the company's common stock at an initial conversion rate of 6.575 shares for each 1,000 principal amount at maturity of the debentures, subject to adjustments upon occurrence of specified events. the debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company. the debentures are not redeemable by the company prior to march 25, 2003. on or after such date, the debentures are redeemable for cash with at least 30 days notice, at the option of the company. the company is required to purchase debentures at the option of the holder as of march 25, 2003, march 25, 2008 and march 25, 2013, at purchase prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to such dates. the company may, at its option, elect to pay any such purchase price in cash or common stock or any combination thereof. however, the bank credit facility prohibits the company from redeeming or repurchasing debentures for cash. the company was required to file a registration statement with the sec to register the debentures by june 23, 1998. this registration statement was filed on february 4, 1999 and the sec has not declared the registration statement effective. the company's failure to file the registration statement by june 23, 1998 did not constitute default under the terms of the debentures. as part of the normal review process by the sec, a number of comments have been made by the staff of the division of corporation finance relating to the registration statement and the restated 1996 and 1997 financial statements included therein. the company has filed an amendment to this registration statement. from june 23, 1998 until the registration statement is declared effective, the company is required to pay to the debenture holders cash liquidated damages accruing, for each day during such period, at a rate per annum equal to 0.25 during the first 90 days and 0.50 thereafter multiplied by the total of the issue price of the debentures plus the original issue discount thereon on such day. the company made its first payment of approximately 500,000 to the debenture holders on september 25, 1998 and an additional 2 million was paid on march 25, 1999. an additional cash payment of approximately 2 million, representing the company's liability to debenture holders through june 30, 1999, will be paid on september 25, 1999. concurrent with the acquisitions, the company replaced its 250 million syndicated unsecured five year revolving credit facility with the bank credit facility. the bank credit facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to 1.7 billion and in addition to other customary covenants, required sunbeam to maintain specified consolidated leverage, interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as of the end of each fiscal quarter occurring after march 31, 1998 and on or prior to the latest stated maturity date for any of the borrowings under the bank credit facility. as a result of, among other things, its operating losses incurred during the first half of 1998, the company did not achieve the specified financial ratios for june 30, 1998 and it appeared unlikely that the company would achieve the specified financial ratios for september 30, 1998. consequently, the company and its lenders entered into an agreement dated as of june 30, 1998 that waived through december 31, 1998 all defaults arising from the failure of the company to satisfy the specified financial ratios for june 30, 1998 and september 30, 1998. pursuant to an agreement with the company dated as of october 19, 1998, the 43 company's lenders extended all of the waivers under the june 30 agreement through april 10, 1999 and also waived through such date all defaults arising from any failure by the company to satisfy the specified financial ratios for december 31, 1998. as part of the october 19, 1998 agreement, the company agreed to a minimum monthly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ebitda covenant for each of february, march and april of 1999, which covenant the company was able to satisfy. on april 10, 1999, among other things, the lenders extended all of the waivers set forth in the october 19, 1998 agreement through april 15, 1999. on april 15, 1999, the company and its lenders entered into a comprehensive amendment to the bank credit facility that, among other things, extended all of the waivers under the april 10, 1999 agreement until april 10, 2000 and waived until such date all defaults arising from any failure by the company to satisfy the specified financial ratios for any fiscal quarter end occurring during 1999 and for march 31, 2000. as part of the april 15, 1999 amendment, the company agreed to a minimum cumulative ebitda covenant that is based on post december 31, 1998 consolidated ebitda and is tested at the end of each month occurring on or prior to march 31, 2000, as well as a covenant limiting the amount of revolving loans other than those used to fund the coleman merger that may be outstanding under the bank credit facility as of the end of each such month. the minimum cumulative ebitda was initially 6.3 million for the period january 1, 1999 through april 30, 1999 and generally grows on a monthly basis until it reaches 121 million for the period from january 1, 1999 through march 31, 2000. the following description of the bank credit facility reflects the terms of the bank credit facility as amended to date. the bank credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to 1.7 billion through o a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 400.0 million maturing march 30, 2005, 52.5 million of which may only be used to complete the coleman merger o up to 800.0 million in term loans maturing on march 30, 2005, of which 35.0 million may only be used to complete the coleman merger and o a 500.0 million term loan maturing september 30, 2006 of which 5.0 million has already been repaid through march 31, 1999. as of december 31, 1998, approximately 1.4 billion was outstanding and approximately 0.2 billion was available for borrowing under the bank credit facility. the remaining 0.1 billion of the 1.7 billion bank credit facility was committed for outstanding letters of credit. under the bank credit facility, interest accrues, at sunbeam's option o at the london interbank offered rate libor or o at the base rate of the administrative agent which is generally the higher of the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent or the federal funds rate plus 0.50 in each case plus an interest margin which is currently 3.75 for libor borrowings and 2.50 for base rate borrowings. the applicable interest margin is subject to upward or downward adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. under an april 15, 1999 amendment to the bank credit facility, we agreed to pay the bank lenders a loan commitment fee of between 0.25 to 1.00 of the commitments under the bank credit facility as of april 15, 1999. the percentage used to calculate the fee will be determined by reference to the bank lenders' aggregate commitments and loan exposure under the bank credit facility as they may be reduced on or before september 30, 2000. the fee is payable on the earlier of september 30, 2000 and the date the commitments are terminated and the loans and other amount payable under the bank credit facility are repaid. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. borrowings under the bank credit facility are secured by a pledge of the stock of the company's material subsidiaries, including coleman, and by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the company and its material domestic subsidiaries, other than coleman and its material subsidiaries except as described below. currently, coleman's inventory and related assets are pledged to secure its obligations for letters of credit issued for its account under the bank credit facility. additionally, as security for coleman's note payable to the company, coleman pledged substantially all of its domestic assets, other than real property, including 66 of the stock of its direct foreign subsidiaries and domestic holding companies for its foreign subsidiaries and all of the stock of its other direct domestic subsidiaries but not the assets of coleman's subsidiaries. the pledge runs in favor of the company's lending banks, to which the coleman 44 note has been pledged as security for the company's obligations to them. upon completion of the coleman merger, substantially all of coleman's assets and the assets of coleman's domestic subsidiaries will be pledged to secure the obligations under the bank credit facility. in addition, borrowings under the bank credit facility are guaranteed by a number of the company's wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries and these subsidiary guarantees are secured as described above. upon completion of the coleman merger, coleman and each of its united states subsidiaries will become guarantors of the obligations under the bank credit facility. to the extent extensions of credit are made to any subsidiaries of the company, the obligations of such subsidiaries are guaranteed by the company. in addition to the above described financial ratios and tests, the bank credit facility contains covenants customary for credit facilities of a similar nature, including limitations on the ability of the company and its subsidiaries, including coleman, to, among other things o declare dividends or repurchase stock o prepay, redeem or repurchase debt, incur liens and engage in sale leaseback transactions o make loans and investments o incur additional debt, including revolving loans under the bank credit facility o amend or otherwise alter material agreements or enter into restrictive agreements o make capital and year 2000 compliance expenditures o engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales o engage in certain transactions with affiliates o settle certain litigation o alter its cash management system and o alter the businesses they conduct. the company is also required to comply with specified financial covenants and ratios. the bank credit facility provides for events of default customary for transactions of this type, including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach of covenant, cross defaults, bankruptcy, material adverse change arising from compliance with erisa, material adverse judgments, entering into guarantees and change of ownership and control. it is also an event of default under the bank credit facility if the company's registration statement in connection with the coleman merger is not declared effective by the sec on or before october 30, 1999 or if the merger does not occur within 25 business days of the effectiveness of the registration statement or if the cash consideration including any payments on account of the exercise of any appraisal rights, but excluding related legal, accounting and other customary fees and expenses to consummate the coleman merger exceeds 87.5 million. although there can be no assurance, the company anticipates that it will satisfy these conditions. furthermore, the bank credit facility requires the company to prepay term loans under the bank credit facility on each of september 30, 1999 and december 31, 1999 to the extent that cash on hand in the company's concentration accounts plus the aggregate amount of unused revolving loan commitments on these dates excluding, for the september 30, 1999 measurement date, 52.5 million reserved for the coleman merger , exceeds 115 million and 125 million, respectively, but sunbeam is not required to prepay more than 69.3 million in the aggregate as a result of the provision. unless waived by the bank lenders, the failure of the company to satisfy any of the financial ratios and tests contained in the bank credit facility or the occurrence of any other event of default under the bank credit facility would entitle the bank lenders to a receive a 2.00 increase in the interest rate applicable to outstanding loans and increase the trade letter of credit fees to 1.00 and b accelerate the maturity of the outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility and exercise all or any of their other rights and remedies. any such acceleration or other exercise of rights and remedies would likely have a material adverse effect on sunbeam. the bank credit facility also includes provisions for the deferral of the 1999 scheduled term loan payments of 69.3 million until april 10, 2000 subject to delivery of certain collateral documents and the filing of an amendment to the company's registration statement on form s 4 relating to the coleman merger. if these conditions are met, and there are no events of default, the scheduled loan payments will be extended until april 10, 2000. the company anticipates that it will satisfy these conditions and, accordingly, has 45 classified these amounts as long term in the consolidated balance sheet. see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements. cash flows as of december 31, 1998, sunbeam had cash and cash equivalents of 61.4 million, working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents of 427.1 million and total debt of 2.3 billion. cash used in operating activities during 1998 was 190.4 million compared to 6.0 million used in operating activities in 1997. this change is primarily attributable to lower earnings after giving effect to non cash charges partially offset by improvements in working capital. during 1998, 184.2 million in cash was generated by reducing receivables, including through the revolving trade accounts receivable securitization program described below, and reducing inventories, which was partially offset by a 68.2 million reduction in accounts payable levels. in the fourth quarter of 1998, cash provided by operating activities totaled 34.3 million, principally due to cash generated by reducing receivables and inventories of 181.9 million. the decrease in cash provided by operations from 1996 to 1997 is primarily attributable to increased inventory levels in 1997 and spending in 1997 related to the restructuring initiatives accrued for in 1996, largely offset by an increase in cash generated by earnings in 1997 and an income tax refund net of payments in 1997. cash used in operating activities reflects proceeds of 200.0 million in 1998 and 58.9 million in 1997 from the company's revolving trade accounts receivable securitization program, described below. cash used in investing activities in 1998 reflects 522.4 million for the acquisitions. in 1997, cash provided by investing activities reflected 91.0 million in proceeds from the sales of divested operations and other assets. capital spending totaled 53.7 million in 1998 and was primarily for manufacturing efficiency initiatives, equipment and tooling for new products, and management information systems hardware and software licenses. the new product capital spending principally related to the air and water filtration products which were discontinued in the second quarter of 1998, electric blankets, grills, clippers and appliances. capital spending in 1997 was 60.5 million and was primarily attributable to manufacturing capacity expansion, cost reduction initiatives and equipment to manufacture new products. the new product capital spending in 1997 principally related to appliances and included costs related to blenders, toasters, stand mixers, slow cookers and a soft serve ice cream product. capital spending in 1996 was 75.3 million, including 14.5 million related to the discontinued furniture business, and was primarily attributable to equipment for new product development and cost reduction initiatives. as discussed above, the company's capital and year 2000 compliance expenditures are limited under the terms of the bank credit facility. cash provided by financing activities totaled 766.2 million in 1998 and reflects o the net proceeds from the sale of debentures of 729.6 million o the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under the company's 250 million september 1996 revolving credit facility o the repayment of debt in connection with the acquisitions o the early extinguishment of the 75.0 million hattiesburg industrial revenue bond and o net borrowings under the bank credit facility. in addition, cash provided by financing activities during 1998 includes 19.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. during 1997, cash provided by financing activities of 16.4 million reflected o net borrowings of 5.0 million under the company's september 1996 revolving credit facility o 12.2 million of debt repayments related to the divested furniture business and other assets sold and o 26.6 million in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options. during 1996, cash provided by financing activities of 45.3 million primarily reflected o revolving credit facility borrowings of 30.0 million to support working capital and capital spending requirements o 11.5 million in new issuances of long term debt and o 4.6 million in proceeds from the sale of treasury shares to certain executives of the company. in december 1997, the company entered into a revolving trade accounts receivable securitization program, which as amended expires in march 2000, to sell without recourse, through a wholly owned 46 subsidiary, up to a maximum of 70 million in trade accounts receivable. the company, as agent for the purchaser of the receivables, retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the purchased receivables. for the year ended december 31, 1998, the company sold approximately 200 million of accounts receivable under this program. at december 31, 1998, the company had reduced accounts receivable by 20.0 million for receivables sold under this program. the company expects to continue to utilize the securitization program to finance a portion of its accounts receivable. see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. at december 31, 1998, standby and commercial letters of credit aggregated 82.3 million and were predominately for insurance, pension, environmental, workers' compensation, and international trade activities. in addition, as of december 31, 1998, surety bonds with a contract value of 26.5 million were outstanding largely as a result of litigation judgments that are currently under appeal. for additional information relating to the debentures, the bank credit facility and the repayment of debt, see note 3 of notes to consolidated and consolidated financial statements. the company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in coleman in a merger transaction in which the existing coleman minority shareholders will receive 0.5677 share of the company's common stock and 6.44 in cash for each share of coleman common stock outstanding. in addition, unexercised options under coleman's stock option plans will be cashed out at a price per share equal to the difference between 27.50 and the exercise price of such options. the company expects to issue approximately 6.7 million shares of common stock and expend approximately 87 million in cash, including cash paid to option holders, to complete the coleman transaction. see note 2 and note 15 to consolidated financial statements. although there can be no assurance, it is anticipated that the coleman merger will occur in the second half of fiscal 1999. the company believes its borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility, cash flow from the combined operations of the company and its acquired companies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivable securitization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs, capital expenditure and year 2000 compliance spending, and debt service through april 10, 2000. the company intends to negotiate with its lenders on an amendment to the bank credit facility, negotiate with its lenders on further waiver of such covenants and other terms or refinance the bank credit facility. any decisions with respect to such amendment, waiver, or refinancing will be made based on a review from time to time of the advisability of particular transactions. there can be no assurance that an amendment, further waiver of existing covenants and other terms, or refinancing will be entered into by april 10, 2000. the failure to obtain such an amendment, further waiver or debt refinancing would likely result in violation of existing covenants and compliance with other terms, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity of all outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the company. accordingly, debt related to the bank credit facility and all debt containing cross default provisions was classified as current in the second quarter of 1999. in may 1998, the nyse advised the company that it did not meet the nyse's continuing listing standards because the company did not have tangible net assets of 12.0 million at december 31, 1997 and average annual net income of at least 0.6 million for fiscal years 1997, 1996 and 1995. the company representatives met with nyse officials, and in march 1999, the nyse informed the company that the company's common stock would not be delisted at that time, although the nyse would, however, continue to monitor the company's financial condition and operations. the nyse subsequently advised the company that the nyse had revised its continuing listing standards, and that the company is in compliance with the revised standards. in april 1999, the nyse advised coleman that it did not meet the nyse's continuing listing standards because coleman did not have tangible assets of at least 12.0 million at september 30, 1998 and an annual net income of at least 0.6 million for fiscal years 1997, 1996 and 1995. at that time, coleman requested the nyse to continue to list the coleman common stock until completion of the merger. the nyse subsequently advised coleman that coleman also failed to satisfy certain non financial continuing listing standards. the nyse subsequently advised coleman that the nyse had revised its continuing listing standards, and that coleman is in compliance with the revised financial standards. coleman and the nyse have agreed upon a program whereby coleman will correct the deficiencies in its non financial continuing listing standards by the end of 1999. coleman is currently complying with such program. if coleman were to 47 be delisted from the nyse, it could adversely affect the market price of coleman's common stock and coleman's ability to sell its capital stock to third parties. however, the company's bank credit facility currently restricts coleman from taking such actions. by letter dated june 17, 1998, the staff of the division of enforcement of the sec advised the company that it was conducting an informal inquiry into sunbeam's accounting policies and procedures and requested that the company produce documents. on july 2, 1998, the sec issued a formal order of private investigation, designating officers to take testimony and pursuant to which a subpoena was served on the company requiring the production of documents. on november 4, 1998, the company received another sec subpoena requiring the production of additional documents. the company has provided numerous documents to the sec staff and continues to cooperate with the sec staff. the company has, however, declined to provide the sec with material that the company believes is subject to the attorney client privilege and the work product liability. the company cannot predict the term of such investigation or its potential outcome. the company is involved in significant litigation, including class and derivative actions, relating to events which led to the restatement of its consolidated financial statements, the issuance of the macandrews forbes warrant, the sale of the debentures and the employment agreements, of messrs. dunlap and kersh. the company intends to vigorously defend each of the actions, but cannot predict the outcome and is not currently able to evaluate the likelihood of the company's success in each case or the range of potential loss. however, if the company were to lose these suits, judgments would likely have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. additionally, the company's insurance carriers have filed various suits requesting a declaratory judgment that the directors' and officers' liability insurance policies for excess coverage was invalid and or had been properly canceled by the carriers or have advised the company of their intent to deny coverage under such policies. the company intends to pursue recovery from all of its insurers if damages are awarded against the company or its indemnified officers and or directors under any of the foregoing actions and to recover attorneys' fees covered under those policies. the company's failure to obtain such insurance recoveries following an adverse judgment against the company on any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs damages and or settlement amounts in connection with pending litigation and claims and related anticipated legal fees. the costs are accrued when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. the accruals are based upon the company's assessment, after consultation with counsel, of probable loss based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature of the claim made, the nature of the damages sought and any relevant information about the plaintiffs, and other significant factors which vary by case. when it is not possible to estimate a specific expected cost to be incurred, the company evaluates the range of probable loss and records the minimum end of the range. as of december 31, 1998, the company had established accruals for litigation matters of 31.2 million representing 17.5 million and 13.7 million for estimated damages or settlement amounts and legal fees, respectively and 9.9 million as of december 28, 1997, representing 3.0 million and 6.9 million for estimated damages or settlement amounts and legal fees, respectively . it is anticipated that the 31.2 million accrual will be paid as follows 22.4 million in 1999, 7.5 million in 2000, and 1.3 million in 2001. the company believes, based on information known to the company on december 31, 1998, that anticipated probable costs of litigation matters existing as of december 31, 1998 have been adequately reserved, to the extent determinable. as a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the company faces the constant risks of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for substantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. these claims could result in liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. some of the product lines the company acquired in the 1998 acquisitions have increased its exposure to product liability and related claims. the company and its subsidiaries are also involved in various lawsuits from time to time that the company considers to be ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business. in the opinion of the company, the resolution of these routine matters, and of matters relating to prior operations, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the company. 48 for additional information relating to litigation, see item 3 legal proceedings. new accounting standards in march 1998, the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position 98 1, accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 98 1 . sop 98 1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. the company adopted sop 98 1 effective january 1, 1999. adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. actual charges incurred due to systems projects may be material. in april 1998, the aicpa issued statement of position 98 5, reporting on the cost of start up activities sop 98 5 . sop 98 5 requires all costs associated with pre opening, pre operating and organization activities to be expensed as incurred. the company adopted sop 98 5 beginning january 1, 1999. adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. in june 1998, the fasb issued sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15, 2000. sfas no. 133 requires the recognition of all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. the company has not yet determined the impact sfas no. 133 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. year 2000 readiness disclosure the following disclosure is as of may 11, 1999. the company is preparing for the impact of the year 2000 on its operations. year 2000 issues could include potential problems in the information technology it and non it systems that the company uses in its operations and problems in the company's products. year 2000 system failures could affect routine but critical operations such as forecasting, purchasing, production, order processing, inventory control, shipping, billing and collection. in addition, system failures could affect the company's security, payroll operations, or employee safety. the company may also be exposed to potential risks from third parties with whom the company interacts who fail to adequately address their own year 2000 issues. sunbeam's approach to year 2000 issues while the company's year 2000 readiness planning has been underway for over one year, during the third quarter of 1998 the company established a cross functional project team consisting of senior managers, assisted by three external consulting firms which were retained to provide consulting services and to assist the company in implementing its year 2000 strategy. this team is headed by the company's chief financial officer who reports directly to the company's chief executive officer on this issue. the audit committee of the board of directors is advised periodically on the status of sunbeam's year 2000 readiness program. the year 2000 project team has developed a phased approach to identify and resolve year 2000 issues with many of these activities conducted in parallel. the company's approach and the anticipated timing of each phase are described below. phase 1 inventory and assessment. during the first phase of the company's year 2000 readiness program, the company established a year 2000 program management office to centralize the management of all of the company's year 2000 projects. through this office, the company developed a corporate wide, uniform strategy for assessing and addressing the year 2000 issues. the company has completed an inventory of its hardware and software systems, manufacturing equipment, electronic data interchange, telecommunications and other technical assets potentially subject to year 2000 problems, such as security systems and controls for lighting, air conditioning, ventilation and facility access. this inventory was then entered into the company's year 2000 database along with a determination of the item's level of criticality to operations. for those inventory items anticipated to have a significant effect on the business if not corrected, the company's year 2000 program envisions repair or replacement and testing of such items. all information relative to each item is being tracked in the company's year 2000 database. the company completed most of this phase during the third and fourth 49 quarters of 1998. sunbeam has completed a review of the readiness of embedded microprocessors in its products and determined that none of the company's products have year 2000 date sensitive systems. phase 2 correction and testing. the second phase of the company's year 2000 readiness program is structured to replace, upgrade or remediate, as necessary, those items identified during phase 1 as requiring corrective action. the company relies on its it functions to perform many tasks that are critical to its operations. significant transactions that could be impacted by not being ready for any year 2000 issues include, among others o purchases of materials o production management o order entry and fulfillment o payroll processing and o billing and collections. systems and applications that have been identified by the company to date as not currently year 2000 ready and which are critical to the company's operations include o financial software systems, which process o order entry o purchasing o production management o general ledger o accounts receivable and o accounts payable functions o payroll applications and o critical applications in the company's manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as warehouse management applications. recognizing how dependent the entire company is on it, the company decided in 1997 to replace its primary business applications with a uniform international business and accounting information system to address the systems or applications listed above as well as to improve internal reporting processes. based upon representations from the manufacturer that the current version of this uniform information system is year 2000 ready, the company has been actively upgrading its business sites that currently utilize this uniform system to the year 2000 ready version. in addition to the pre acquisition sunbeam locations which had already utilized an earlier non year 2000 ready version of this uniform business and accounting information system, eastpak, mr. coffee, health o meter, and sunbeam latin america are replacing their current non year 2000 ready systems with this new uniform system. in addition, coleman europe is also replacing key business components with this new system. the company is also actively replacing and or upgrading a number of business systems that are not year 2000 ready, including those that use localized business system packages which were not candidates to be replaced by the uniform business and accounting information system. for example, at coleman approximately 2,000 mainframe software programs that are used in lieu of sunbeam's uniform business and accounting information system have been remediated and tested to be year 2000 ready. with respect to the company's non it systems, including time and attendance, security, and in line manufacturing hardware, the company is actively analyzing these items to assess any year 2000 issues. to date, no material issues have been discovered, and the company will continue to review, test and correct, if necessary, such items. the company has largely implemented the corrective work described above and expects to complete final testing and implementation of such systems in the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 1999. phase 3 customers, suppliers and business partners. the third phase of the company's year 2000 readiness program which was initiated during the third and fourth quarters of 1998 is designed to assess and interact with the company's customers, suppliers, and business partners. as part of this effort, the company surveyed 1,100 vendors and suppliers, a portion of which did not provide an initial response. during the first five months of 1999, high risk vendors were contacted directly and the number of non respondents has 50 since decreased substantially. in fact, currently only 13 of the company's vendors who were surveyed are categorized as high risk which includes non respondents. based on the most recent responses to the survey and continued evaluation, the company believes that there is only a low to a medium risk of year 2000 issues for the remaining vendors. the company will continue to monitor the year 2000 progress of the high risk vendors and will re survey these companies in late august to determine the appropriate course of action. furthermore, the company is in the process of contacting alternate vendors who are year 2000 ready to replace critical vendors deemed high risk in the event that these vendors are not found to be year 2000 ready. the company has not independently verified the responses of vendors and does not anticipate undertaking such independent verification process. beginning in the second quarter of 1999, the company began contacting its major customers to confirm their preparations for year 2000 issues. sunbeam has already responded to numerous customer inquiries and believes that all of the company's major customers have established programs to deal with year 2000 issues. in order to improve the company's communication with its customers, suppliers and business partners, the company has set up a sunbeam year 2000 telephone number and is in the process of providing year 2000 information on a company web site. phase 4 contingency planning. this phase will involve contingency planning for unresolved year 2000 issues, particularly any issues arising with third party suppliers. the company's year 2000 readiness program is ongoing and its ultimate scope, as well as the consideration of contingency plans, will continue to be evaluated as new information becomes available. as a precautionary measure, the company plans to establish a contingency plan for addressing any effects of the year 2000 on its operations, whether due to the company's systems or those of third parties not being ready for any year 2000 issues. the company expects to substantially complete such contingency plan by september 30, 1999 such contingency plan will address alternative processes, such as manual procedures, electronic spreadsheets, potential alternative service providers, and plans to address year 2000 readiness issues as they arise. such contingency plans may also require an increase in inventory during the second half of 1999 to protect against supply interruption. the risks of sunbeam's year 2000 approach the independent consultants assisting the company in its year 2000 readiness program have reviewed and concurred with the company's approach, have assisted in developing cost estimates and have monitored costs for the largest single component upgrade or installation of the company's uniform system of the company's year 2000 program. since the company's year 2000 program was developed and is monitored with the help of independent consultants, the company did not engage another independent third party to verify the program's overall approach or total cost based on this, the company believes that the company's exposure in this regard is mitigated. in addition, through the use of external third party diagnostic software packages that are designed to analyze the year 2000 readiness of business software programs, the company was able to identify potential year 2000 issues at coleman. given this, the company believes that it has also mitigated its risk by validating and verifying key program components. management believes that, although there are significant systems that are being modified or replaced, including the uniform business and accounting information system, the company's information systems environment will be made year 2000 ready prior to january 1, 2000. the company's failure to timely complete such corrective work could have a material adverse impact on the company. with respect to customers, suppliers and business partners, the failure of some of these third parties to become year 2000 ready could also have a material adverse impact on the company. for example, the failure of some of the company's principal suppliers to have year 2000 ready internal systems could impact the company's ability to manufacture and or ship its products or to maintain adequate inventory levels for production. at this time, the company believes that the most likely worst case scenario relating to year 2000 involves potential disruptions in areas in which the company's operations must rely on third parties, such as suppliers, whose systems may not work properly after january 1, 2000. while such system failures could either directly or indirectly affect important operations of the company and its subsidiaries in a significant manner, the company cannot at present estimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures. subject to the nature of the goods or services provided to the company by third parties whose operations are 51 not made ready for year 2000 issues, the impact on the company's operations could be material if appropriate contingency plans cannot be developed prior to january 1, 2000. the nature and focus of the company's efforts to address the year 2000 problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issues are identified. in addition, it is important to note that the description of the company's efforts and assessments necessarily involves estimates and projections with respect to activities required in the future. these estimates and projections are subject to change as work continues, and such changes may be substantial. the costs to address sunbeam's year 2000 issues through december 31, 1998 the company had expended approximately 19 million to address year 2000 issues of which approximately 50 was recorded as capital expenditures and the remainder as sg a expense. the company's current assessment of the total costs to address and remedy year 2000 issues and enhance its operating systems, including costs for the acquired companies, is approximately 60 million. this estimate includes the following categories o uniform international business and accounting system 40 million o localized business system software upgrades and remediation 9 million o year 2000 readiness assessment and tracking 6 million o upgrade of personal computers and related software 5 million the amount to be incurred for year 2000 issues during 1999 of approximately 41 million represents over 50 of the company's total 1999 budget for information systems and related support, including year 2000 costs. a large majority of these costs are expected to be incremental expenditures that will not recur in the year 2000 or thereafter. fees and expenses related to third party consultants, who are involved in the program management office as well as the modification and replacement of software, represent approximately 75 of the total estimated cost. the balance of the total estimated cost relates primarily to software license fees and new hardware, but excludes the costs associated with company employees. the company expects these expenditures to be financed through operating cash flows or borrowings, as applicable. a significant portion of these expenditures will enhance the company's operating systems in addition to resolving the year 2000 issues. as the company completes its assessment of the year 2000 issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differ materially from the amounts shown above. the bank credit facility does not permit the company to spend more than 50 million on year 2000 testing and remediation during 1999. because year 2000 readiness is critical to the business, the company has redeployed some resources from non critical system enhancements to address year 2000 issues. in addition, due to the importance of it systems to the company's business, management has deferred non critical systems enhancements as much as possible. the company does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to have a material impact on the company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. effects of inflation for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 1998 the company's cost of raw materials and other product remained relatively stable. to the extent possible, the company's objective is to offset the impact of inflation through productivity enhancements, cost reductions and price increases. cautionary statements certain statements in this prospectus may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as
