information available to the company on the date of this report. the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. forward looking statements are subject to a number of factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations. the following factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements the materially weakened financial condition of the company, resulting from its significant losses in recent years very weak demand for air travel and lower investment asset returns resulting from the severe global economic downturn the company s need to raise substantial additional funds and its ability to do so on acceptable terms the ability of the company to generate additional revenues and reduce its costs continued high and volatile fuel prices and further increases in the price of fuel, and the availability of fuel the company s substantial indebtedness and other obligations the ability of the company to satisfy certain covenants and conditions in certain of its financing and other agreements changes in economic and other conditions beyond the company s control, and the volatile results of the company s operations the fiercely and increasingly competitive business environment faced by the company potential industry consolidation and alliance changes competition with reorganized carriers low fare levels by historical standards and the company s reduced pricing power changes in the company s corporate or business strategy extensive government regulation of the company s business conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks uncertainties with respect to the company s international operations outbreaks of a disease such as sars, avian flu or the h1n1 virus that affects travel behavior labor costs that are higher than those of the company s competitors uncertainties with respect to the company s relationships with unionized and other employee work groups increased insurance costs and potential reductions of available insurance coverage the company s ability to retain key management personnel potential failures or disruptions of the company s computer, communications or other technology systems losses and adverse publicity resulting from any accident involving the company s aircraft interruptions or disruptions in service at one or more of the company s primary market airports the heavy taxation of the airline industry changes in the price of the company s common stock and the ability of the company to reach acceptable agreements with third parties. additional information concerning these and other factors is contained in the company s securities and exchange commission filings, including the 2009 form 10 k. 12 table of contents overview the company recorded a net loss of 11 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to a net loss of 390 million in the same period last year. the company s improved performance is primarily the result of higher unit revenues passenger revenue per available seat mile . mainline passenger unit revenues increased 16.8 percent for the second quarter due to a 2.0 point load factor increase and a 14.0 percent increase in passenger yield passenger revenue per passenger mile compared to the same period in 2009. although the company recorded significant year over year unit revenue improvement in the second quarter of 2010, passenger yields remain insufficient to drive positive net earnings. the company believes this is the result of a fragmented industry with numerous competitors, excess capacity and pricing transparency resulting from the use of the internet and other factors. the company believes that its limited pricing power could persist indefinitely. the increases in comparative second quarter revenue were partially offset by a significant year over year increase in fuel prices from an average of 1.90 per gallon in the second quarter of 2009 to an average of 2.37 per gallon in the second quarter of 2010, including the effects of hedging. the price increase resulted in 334 million in incremental year over year fuel expense in the three months ended june 30, 2010 based on the year over year increase in the average price per gallon multiplied by gallons consumed . in addition, the company s north atlantic operations in the second quarter 2010 were impacted by the eruption of the icelandic volcano which began in april. however, flight disruptions did not have a material adverse impact on the company s results. comparatively, during the second quarter of 2009, there was an outbreak of the h1n1 influenza virus which had an estimated 50 to 80 million adverse revenue impact, primarily on operations to and from mexico. also in the second quarter 2009, the company incurred approximately 70 million in non recurring charges related to the sale of certain aircraft and the grounding of leased airbus a300 aircraft prior to lease expiration. in late 2009, the company unveiled a new business plan flightplan 2020. flightplan 2020 is a strategic framework developed to secure the company s future by focusing on what will be required to succeed in the airline business over the next decade. it establishes the company s priorities and a clear path to better position the company to meet the challenges of the coming years. this plan for achieving sustained profitability has five tenets i invest wisely, ii earn customer loyalty, iii strengthen and defend our global network, iv be a good place for good people and v fly profitably. under flightplan 2020, the company launched its network strategy that focuses resources in its cornerstone markets of dallas fort worth, chicago, miami, los angeles and new york, and has continued to execute its fleet renewal and replacement plan. further, the company continues to pursue its strategy to form cooperative agreements with oneworld members and other airlines. on july 14, 2010 and july 20, 2010, american obtained clearance from the european commission ec and approval by the department of transportation dot , respectively, for antitrust immunity ati for its planned cooperation with british airways, iberia, finnair and royal jordanian. in addition, the company is awaiting approval by regulatory entities of american s joint business agreement jba with japan airlines jal . regulatory conditions for ati approval for the british airways, iberia, finnair and royal jordanian cooperative agreement include obligations to lease to other carriers up to seven takeoff and landing slot pairs at london heathrow and up to three john f. kennedy airport operational authorities, depending on market conditions. in addition to satisfaction of those conditions, implementation of the jba requires successful negotiation of certain detailed financial and commercial arrangements among the carriers, and obtaining other approvals. american expects to begin implementing the jba in the fourth quarter of 2010. no assurances can be given as to any arrangements that may ultimately be implemented or any benefits the company may derive from such arrangements. the company s and jal s joint application to dot for ati on certain routes and joint notification to the ministry of land infrastructure, transport and tourism of japan mlit is pending approval. implementation of the jba with jal is also subject to successful negotiation of certain detailed financial and commercial arrangements and other approvals. american expects to begin implementing the jba with jal in 2011. no assurances can be given as to any arrangements that may ultimately be implemented or any benefits that the company may derive from such arrangements. 13 table of contents the company s agreements for the previously announced commercial collaboration in new york and boston with jetblue commenced on july 20, 2010. the agreement provides customers with convenient, interline service in non overlapping markets, letting customers connect between 14 of american s international destinations from new york s john f. kennedy international airport and boston s logan airport and 18 domestic cities flown from those two airports by jetblue. further, american announced it will expand its relationship with jetblue in the coming months, so that aadvantage members and members of jetblue s customer loyalty program will be able to earn aadvantage miles or jetblue points, respectively, when they fly only on american and jetblue cooperative interline routes. under the terms of the agreements for commercial collaboration, american intends to transfer eight slot pairs at ronald reagan national airport in washington d.c. currently owned by american and one slot pair at white plains, new york currently owned by amr eagle to jetblue, and jetblue intends to transfer twelve slot pairs at jfk to american beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010. the company currently estimates that the implementation of its cornerstone strategy, the implementation of the company s proposed jbas with british airways iberia and jal, and various other alliance and network activities will result in incremental revenues and cost savings of over 500 million per year. the company expects that it will realize the majority of these incremental revenues and cost savings in 2011, and the remainder by year end 2012. this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that are inherently uncertain, and the company s ability to realize these benefits depends on various factors, some of which are beyond the company s control, such as obtaining regulatory approvals of its proposed jbas and other factors referred to above in forward looking information. the company is in active labor contract negotiations with each of its organized labor groups. the company has negotiated tentative agreements with several workgroups within the twu including the maintenance control technician group, the material logistics specialists group and the mechanic and related group. agreements with these twu groups are subject to ratification by the relevant membership of twu, and there are no assurances that these tentative agreements will be ratified. these tentative agreements include lump sum payments and contractual salary increases. if these contracts are ratified by union membership during the third quarter 2010, the company will incur approximately 60 million for lump sum payments and contractual salary increases in that period. under these current tentative agreements, the company anticipates productivity increases in future quarters. mediated negotiation continues with other twu workgroups, the allied pilots association apa and the association of professional flight attendants apfa . based on analysis of airline industry labor contracts, the company estimates that at the beginning of 2010, american s labor cost disadvantage the amount by which its labor costs exceed what such costs would be if they were determined based on other network carrier labor contracts was approximately 600 million per year. the company expects this gap to narrow as open industry labor contracts are settled. this expectation is based on a number of assumptions, the validity of which cannot be assured. the airline industry labor contract negotiation process is inherently uncertain and the results of labor contract negotiations are difficult to predict. in march of 2010, the president signed into law comprehensive health care reform legislation under the patient protection and affordable care act hr 3590 and the health care education and affordability reconciliation act hr 4872 the acts . the acts contain provisions potentially impacting the company s cost and accounting for active employee and retiree medical benefits in future periods. however, according to the recently released interim final regulations promulgated under the acts, the company s retiree medical benefits will be exempt from many of the mandates of the acts under a grandfathering provision. thus, under the company s current assessment of the cost and accounting implications of the acts, no significant impact to its financial statements is expected. in june 2010, the company reiterated its intent to evaluate the possible divestiture of amr eagle, its wholly owned regional carrier. amr eagle owns two regional airlines american eagle airlines, inc american eagle and executive airlines, inc. executive . american eagle feeds american airlines hubs throughout north america, and its affiliate, executive, carries the american eagle name throughout the bahamas and the caribbean from bases in miami and san juan, puerto rico. no prediction can be made as to the outcome of any such evaluation, and if amr were to decide to pursue a divestiture of amr eagle, no prediction can be made as to whether any such divestiture will be completed or the impact of any such divestiture on amr. on july 21, 2010, president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act . the dodd frank act contains provisions which may impact the company, but those effects cannot be predicted at this time. for example, our fuel hedging activities may be affected by the act and regulations promulgated under the act. 14 table of contents the company s ability to become profitable and its ability to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis will depend on a number of factors, many of which are largely beyond the company s control. certain risk factors that affect the company s business and financial results are discussed in the risk factors listed in item 1a in the 2009 form 10 k. in addition, most of the company s largest domestic competitors and several smaller carriers have filed for bankruptcy in previous years and have used this process to significantly reduce contractual labor and other costs. in order to remain competitive and to improve its financial condition, the company must continue to take steps to generate additional revenues and to reduce its costs. although the company has a number of initiatives underway to address its cost and revenue challenges, some of these initiatives involve changes to the company s business which it may be unable to implement. it has also become increasingly difficult to identify and implement significant revenue enhancement and cost savings initiatives. the adequacy and ultimate success of the company s initiatives to generate additional revenues and reduce costs cannot be assured. moreover, whether the company s initiatives will be adequate or successful depends in large measure on factors beyond its control, notably the overall industry environment, including passenger demand, yield and industry capacity growth, and fuel prices. it will be very difficult for the company to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis, and to return to profitability, if the overall industry revenue environment does not improve substantially or if fuel prices were to persist at high levels for an extended period. liquidity and capital resources significant indebtedness and future financing the company remains heavily indebted and has significant obligations including substantial pension funding obligations , as described more fully under item 7, management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the company s 2009 form 10 k. indebtedness is a significant risk to the company as discussed in the risk factors listed in item 1a in the 2009 form 10 k. during the last few years, the company raised substantial financing to fund capital commitments mainly for aircraft and ground properties , debt maturities, and employee pension obligations, and to bolster its liquidity. to meet the company s commitments, to maintain sufficient liquidity and because the company has significant debt, lease and other obligations in the next several years, including commitments to purchase aircraft, as well as substantial pension funding obligations refer to contractual obligations in item 7, management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2009 form 10 k , the company will need access to substantial additional funding. an inability to obtain necessary additional funding on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on the company and on its ability to sustain its operations. as of june 30, 2010, the company is required to make scheduled principal payments of approximately 529 million on long term debt and approximately 26 million in payments on capital leases, and the company expects to spend approximately 1.3 billion on capital expenditures, including aircraft commitments, for the remainder of 2010. in addition, the global economic downturn, rising fuel prices, the possibility of being required to post reserves under credit card processing agreements, and the obligation to post cash collateral on fuel hedging contracts and fund pension plan contributions, among other things, may in the future negatively impact the company s liquidity. the company s substantial indebtedness and other obligations have important consequences. for example, they i limit the company s ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding could be obtained ii require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes iii make the company more vulnerable to economic downturns and catastrophic external events and iv limit the company s ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. 15 table of contents the company s possible remaining financing sources primarily include i a very limited amount of additional secured aircraft debt or sale leaseback transactions involving owned aircraft ii debt secured by other assets iii securitization of future operating receipts iv the sale or monetization of certain assets v unsecured debt and vi issuance of equity or equity like securities. besides unencumbered aircraft, the company s most likely sources of liquidity include the financing of route authorities, takeoff and landing slots, spare parts, and the sale or financing of certain of amr s business units and subsidiaries, such as amr eagle. the company s ability to obtain future financing is limited by the value of its unencumbered assets. almost all of the company s aircraft assets including aircraft eligible for the benefits of section 1110 of the u.s. bankruptcy code are encumbered. also, the market value of these aircraft assets has declined in recent years, and may continue to decline. the company believes it has approximately 2 billion in assets that could be used as possible financing sources as of the date of this filing. however, many of these assets may be difficult to finance, and the availability and level of the financing sources described above cannot be assured. as of june 30, 2010, american had 24 boeing 737 800 aircraft purchase commitments for the remainder of 2010 and eight boeing 737 800 aircraft purchase commitments in 2011. in addition to these aircraft purchase commitments, american had firm commitments for eleven boeing 737 800 aircraft and seven boeing 777 aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2013 through 2016. in addition, american previously announced plans subject to certain reconfirmation rights to acquire 42 boeing 787 9 aircraft, with the right to acquire an additional 58 boeing 787 9 aircraft. american has selected ge aviation as the exclusive provider of engines for its expected order of boeing 787 9 aircraft. as of june 30, 2010, amr eagle had firm commitments for 21 bombardier crj 700 aircraft scheduled to be delivered in the remainder of 2010 and in 2011. as of june 30, 2010, payments for the above purchase commitments will approximate 954 million in the remainder of 2010, 524 million in 2011, 217 million in 2012, 463 million in 2013, 224 million in 2014, and 246 million for 2015 and beyond. these amounts are net of purchase deposits currently held by the manufacturers. on july 21, 2010, the company entered into an amendment to purchase agreement no. 1977 with the boeing company to exercise rights to acquire additional boeing 737 800 aircraft. pursuant to the amendment, american exercised rights to purchase 35 boeing 737 800 aircraft for delivery in 2011 and 2012. the company s total purchase commitments are expected to increase to approximately 4 billion at the end of the third quarter 2010, reflecting this transaction and aircraft deliveries during that period. in conjunction with this transaction, american has arranged for backstop financing of the additional boeing 737 800 aircraft deliveries, subject to certain terms and conditions. in 2008, the company entered into a new purchase agreement with boeing for the acquisition of 42 firm boeing 787 9 aircraft and purchase rights to acquire up to 58 additional b787 aircraft. per the purchase agreement, the first such aircraft was scheduled to be delivered in 2012, and the last firm aircraft was scheduled to be delivered in 2018 with deliveries of additional aircraft, if any, scheduled between 2015 and 2020. in july 2010, the company and boeing agreed upon a revised delivery schedule due to the impact of the overall boeing 787 program delay on american s delivery positions. the first aircraft is currently scheduled to be delivered in 2014, and the last firm aircraft is scheduled to be delivered in 2018 with deliveries of additional aircraft, if any, scheduled between 2016 and 2021. additionally, the revised delivery schedule includes terms and conditions consistent with the original agreement and allows the company the confirmation rights described below. under the current 787 9 purchase agreement, except as described below, american will not be obligated to purchase a 787 9 aircraft unless it gives boeing notice confirming its election to do so at least 18 months prior to the scheduled delivery date for that aircraft. if american does not give that notice with respect to an aircraft, the aircraft will no longer be subject to the 787 9 purchase agreement. these confirmation rights may be exercised until a specified date, may 1, 2014 under the current agreement, provided that those rights will terminate earlier if american reaches a collective bargaining agreement with its pilots union that includes provisions enabling american to utilize the 787 9 to american s satisfaction in the operations desired by american, or if american confirms its election to purchase any of the initial 42 787 9 aircraft. while there can be no assurances, american expects that it will have reached an agreement as described above with its pilots union prior to the first notification date. in either of those events, american would become obligated to purchase all of the initial 42 aircraft then subject to the purchase agreement. if neither of those events occurs prior to may 1, 2014 under the current agreement, then on that date american may elect to purchase all of the initial 42 aircraft then subject to the purchase agreement, and if it does not elect to do so, the purchase agreement will terminate in its entirety. 16 table of contents the company s continued aircraft replacement strategy, and its execution of that strategy, will depend on such factors as future economic and industry conditions and the financial condition of the company. credit card processing and other reserves american has agreements with a number of credit card companies and processors to accept credit cards for the sale of air travel and other services. under certain of these agreements, the related credit card processor may hold back a reserve from american s credit card receivables following the occurrence of certain events, including the failure of american to maintain certain levels of liquidity as specified in each agreement . under such agreements, the amount of the reserve that may be required generally is based on the processor s exposure to the company under the applicable agreement and, in the case a reserve is required because of american s failure to maintain a certain level of liquidity, the amount of such liquidity. as of june 30, 2010, the company was not required to maintain any reserve under such agreements. if circumstances were to occur that would allow the credit card processor to require the company to maintain a reserve, the company s liquidity would be negatively impacted. pension funding obligation the company is required to make minimum contributions to its defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding requirements of erisa, the pension funding equity act of 2004 and the pension protection act of 2006. on june 25, 2010, president obama signed the preservation of access to care for medical beneficiaries and pension relief act of 2010 the relief act , h.r. 3962, into law. the relief act provides for temporary, targeted funding relief subject to certain terms and conditions for single employer and multiemployer pension plans that suffered significant losses in asset value due to the steep market slide in 2008. under the relief act, the company s 2010 minimum contributions to its defined benefit pension plans have been reduced from 525 million to approximately 460 million. on july 15, 2010, the company contributed an additional 72 million to its defined benefit pension plans, for a total of 144 million in 2010 as of the date of this filing. cash flow activity at june 30, 2010, the company had 5.1 billion in unrestricted cash and short term investments, which is an increase of 685 million from the balance as of december 31, 2009. net cash provided by operating activities in the six month period ended june 30, 2010 was 1.2 billion, which was comparable to 938 million over the same period in 2009, which reflects an improved operating environment in 2010. the company made scheduled debt and capital lease payments of 467 million and invested 729 million in capital expenditures in the first six months of 2010. capital expenditures primarily consisted of new aircraft and certain aircraft modifications. the company also continued to enter into previously arranged debt and sale leasebacks upon the delivery of new aircraft in the six months ended june 30, 2010. in the first and second quarters of 2010, amr received delivery of 22 new aircraft financed through 711 million of various previously announced arrangements. in the past, the company has from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased its debt and taken other steps to reduce its debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve its balance sheet. going forward, depending on market conditions, its cash positions and other considerations, the company may continue to take such actions. war risk insurance the u.s. government has agreed to provide commercial war risk insurance for u.s. based airlines through august 31, 2010, covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. if the u.s. government were to cease providing such insurance in whole or in part, it is likely that the company could obtain comparable coverage in the commercial market, but the company would incur substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms. there can be no assurance that comparable war risk coverage will be available in the commercial market. if the company is unable to obtain adequate war risk coverage at commercially reasonable rates, the company would be adversely affected. 17 table of contents results of operations for the three months ended june 30, 2010 and 2009 revenues the company s revenues increased approximately 785 million, or 16.0 percent, to 5.7 billion in the second quarter of 2010 from the same period last year. american s passenger revenues increased by 16.4 percent, or 602 million, on approximately a one half percent decrease in capacity available seat mile asm . american s passenger load factor increased by approximately 2.0 points to 83.9 percent, while passenger yield increased by 14.0 percent to 13.28 cents. this resulted in an increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile

statistical information for american and regional affiliates for the six months ended june 30, 2010 and 2009. six months ended june 30, 2010 2009 american airlines, inc. mainline jet operations

miles millions 5,767 5,739 passenger load factor 71.0 70.4 excludes 1.3 billion and 1.2 billion of expense incurred related to regional affiliates in 2010 and 2009, respectively. outlook the company currently expects capacity for american s mainline jet operations to increase by approximately 3.0 percent in the third quarter of 2010 versus the third quarter of 2009. american s mainline capacity for the full year 2010 is expected to increase approximately one percent from 2009 with a marginal decrease in domestic capacity and approximately a 2.4 percent growth in international capacity. the company expects third quarter 2010 mainline unit costs to remain static year over year. the third quarter 2010 unit cost expectations reflect the projected increase in the cost of fuel year over year offset by special expense items recorded in third quarter of 2009. in addition, unit cost increases are expected due to anticipated higher revenue related expenses such as booking fees and commissions and financing costs related to boeing 737 800 and other aircraft deliveries. due to these cost pressures, the company expects third quarter unit costs excluding fuel and prior year special items to also be consistent with the prior year period. the company is in active labor contract negotiations with each of its organized labor groups. the company has negotiated tentative agreements with several workgroups within the twu including the maintenance control technician group, the material logistics specialists group and the mechanic and related group. agreements with these twu groups are subject to ratification by the relevant membership of twu, and there are no assurances that these tentative agreements will be ratified. these tentative agreements include lump sum payments and contractual salary increases. if these contracts are ratified by union membership, the company s estimate of the third quarter 2010 mainline unit cost impact of the currently negotiated tentative agreements is an incremental 0.15 cents. the company anticipates implementing productivity improvements consistent with the agreements that will help to offset the ongoing cost of salary increases. the company s results are significantly affected by the price of jet fuel, which is in turn affected by a number of factors beyond the company s control. although fuel prices have abated considerably from the record high prices recorded in july 2008, they have steadily increased since the first quarter of 2009 and remain high and extremely volatile by historical standards. 23 table of contents
