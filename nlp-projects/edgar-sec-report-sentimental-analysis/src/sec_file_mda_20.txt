financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected historical financial data and our accompanying financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this document. the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed below under risk factors. overview of our business we are a multi faceted oilfield services company that provides services and equipment to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, domestically in texas, louisiana, new mexico, colorado, oklahoma, and offshore in the gulf of mexico, and internationally in mexico. we operate in five sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry directional drilling services casing and tubing services compressed air drilling services rental tools and production services. we derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and equipment required to provide a service. the price we charge for our services depends upon several factors, including the level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular geographic regions in which we operate. contracts are awarded based on the price, quality of service and equipment, and the general reputation and experience of our personnel. the demand for drilling services has historically been volatile and is affected by the capital expenditures of oil and natural gas exploration and development companies, which can fluctuate based upon the prices of oil and natural gas or the expectation for the prices of oil and natural gas. the number of working drilling rigs, typically referred to as the rig count, is an important indicator of activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry. the rig count in the united states increased from 862 as of december 31, 2002 to 1,532 on march 10, 2006, according to the baker hughes rig count. furthermore, directional and horizontal rig counts increased from 283 as of december 31, 2002 to 605 on march 10, 2006, which accounted for 32.8 and 39.5 of the total u.s. rig count, respectively. currently, we believe that the number of available drilling rigs is insufficient to meet the demand for drilling rigs. consequently, unless a significant number of additional drilling rigs are brought online, the rig count may not increase substantially despite the strong demand. our cost of revenues represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our equipment. the principal elements of these costs are direct and indirect labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment, insurance, equipment rentals, fuel and depreciation. operating expenses do not fluctuate in direct proportion to changes in revenues because, among other factors, we have a fixed base of inventory of equipment and facilities to support our operations, and in periods of low drilling activity we may also seek to preserve labor continuity to market our services and maintain our equipment. cyclical nature of equipment rental and services industry the oilfield services industry is highly cyclical. the most critical factor in assessing the outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas. the peaks and valleys of demand are further apart than those of many other cyclical industries. this is primarily a result of the industry being driven by commodity demand and corresponding price increases. as demand increases, producers raise their prices. the price escalation enables producers to increase their capital expenditures. the increased capital expenditures ultimately result in greater revenues and profits for services and equipment companies. the increased capital expenditures also ultimately result in greater production which historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices. demand for our services has been strong throughout 2003, 2004 and 2005 due to high oil and natural gas prices and increased demand and declining production costs for natural gas as compared to other energy 20 table of contents sources. management believes the current market fundamentals are indicative of a favorable long term trend of activity in our markets. however, these factors could be more than offset by other developments affecting the worldwide supply and demand for oil and natural gas products. restatement we understated diluted earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2003, for each of the first three quarters of 2004, for the years ended december 31, 2003 and 2004 and for the quarter ended march 31, 2005. in addition, we understated basic earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended september 30, 2004. consequently, we have restated our financial statements for each of those periods. the incorrect calculation resulted from a mathematical error and an improper application of statement of financial accounting standards no. 128, earnings per share , or sfas, no. 128. the effect of the restatement is to reduce weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the relevant periods and to reduce weighted average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended september 30, 2004. therefore, diluted earnings per share were increased for the relevant periods and basic earnings per share were increased for the quarter ended september 30, 2004. based on the correction of a mathematical error, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2004, weighted average basic shares outstanding was 8,298,000 and 6,168,000, respectively, compared to the previously reported weighted average basic shares outstanding of 11,599,000 and 7,285,000 for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2004. the effect is to increase basic earnings per share to 0.06 and 0.21 for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2004 compared to the 0.04 and 0.18 previously reported for those periods. based on the proper allocation of sfas no. 128, weighted average diluted shares outstanding was 9,828,000 and 7,890,000 for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2004, respectively, compared to the previously reported weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 14,407,000 and 9,980,000 for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2004, respectively. the effect is to increase diluted earnings per share to 0.05 and 0.18 for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2004, respectively, compared to the 0.04 and 0.13 previously restated, respectively. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december 31, 2005 . in connection with the formation of aircomp in 2003, we, along with m i contributed assets to aircomp in exchange for a 55 interest and 45 interest, respectively, in aircomp. we originally accounted for the formation of aircomp as a joint venture, but in february 2005 determined that the transaction should have been accounted for using purchase accounting pursuant to sfas no. 141, business combinations and sec staff accounting bulletin no. 51 accounting for sales of stock by a subsidiary. consequently, we have restated our financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2003 and for the first three quarters of 2004 see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december 31, 2005 . management has concluded that the need to restate our financial statements resulted, in part, from the lack of sufficient experienced accounting personnel, which in turn resulted in a lack of effective control over the financial reporting process. we have implemented a number of actions that we believe address the deficiencies in our financial reporting process, including the following the addition of experienced accounting personnel with appropriate experience and qualifications to perform quality review procedures and to satisfy our financial reporting obligations. during august 2004, we hired a new chief financial officer and in october of 2004 we hired a full time in house general counsel. in march 2005, we hired a certified public accountant as our financial reporting manager and in july 2005 we hired as chief accounting officer, a certified public accountant who has significant prior experience as a chief accounting officer of a publicly traded company. in 2006, we have added three additional certified public accountants in connection with the growth of our business and to implement and monitor compliance with internal control processes. 21 table of contents in the fourth quarter of 2004, we engaged an independent internal controls consulting firm which is in the process of documenting, analyzing, identifying and correcting deficiencies and testing our internal controls and procedures, including our controls over internal financial reporting. we are in the final stages of completing the implementation of a new accounting software to facilitate timely and accurate reporting. although we have implemented a number of actions as described above, we have not yet had sufficient time to test the newly implemented actions. results of operations in february 2002, we acquired 81 of the outstanding stock of tubular. in february 2002, we also purchased substantially all the outstanding common stock and preferred stock of strata. the results from our casing and tubing services and directional drilling services are included in our operating results from february 1, 2002. in july 2003, through our subsidiary mountain compressed air, inc., we entered into a limited liability company agreement with m i, a company owned by smith international and schlumberger n.v., to form aircomp. we owned 55 and m i owned 45 of aircomp until we purchased m i s interest in july 2005. we have consolidated aircomp into our financial statements beginning with the quarter ending september 30, 2003. in september 2004, we acquired the remaining 19 of tubular and we acquired safco. in november 2004, aircomp acquired substantially all of the assets of diamond air and, in december 2004, we acquired downhole. we consolidated the results of these acquisitions from the day they were acquired. in april 2005, we acquired delta and, in may 2005, we acquired capcoil. we report the operations of downhole and capcoil as our production services segment and the operations of safco and delta as our rental tools segment. in july 2005, we acquired the 45 interest of m i in our compressed air drilling subsidiary, aircomp, making us the 100 owner of aircomp. in addition, in july 2005, we acquired the compressed air drilling assets of w. t. on august 1, 2005, we acquired 100 of the outstanding capital stock of target. the results of target are included in our directional and horizontal drilling segment as their measure while drilling equipment is utilized in that segment. on september 1, 2005, we acquired the casing and tubing service assets of patterson services, inc. we consolidated the results of these acquisitions from the day they were acquired. the foregoing acquisitions affect the comparability from period to period of our historical results, and our historical results may not be indicative of our future results. comparison of years ended december 31, 2005 and december 31, 2004 our revenue for the year ended december 31, 2005 was 105.3 million, an increase of 120.8 compared to 47.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in revenues was principally due to acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the second and third quarters of 2005, the addition of operations and sales personnel, the opening of new operations offices, and the purchase of additional equipment. acquisitions completed during this period enabled us to establish our rental tool and production services segments which resulted in an increased offering of products and services and an expansion of our customer base. directional drilling services segment revenues increased in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period due to the addition of operations and sales personnel, the opening of new operations offices and the purchase of additional downhole motors which increased our capacity and market presence. revenues increased at our compressed air drilling segment due to acquisition of the air drilling assets of w. t. on july 11, 2005, the acquisitions of diamond air on november 1, 2004 and improved pricing for our services in west texas. revenues increased at our casing and tubing services segment due to the acquisition of the casing and tubing assets of patterson services inc. on september 1, 2005, increased revenues from mexico, improved 22 table of contents market conditions, improved market penetration for our services in south texas and the addition of operating personnel and equipment which broadened our capabilities. also contributing to increased revenues were the acquisitions of safco as of september 1, 2004, downhole as of december 1, 2004, delta as of april 1, 2005 and capcoil as of may 1, 2005. downhole and capcoil comprise our production services segment and were merged in february 2006 to form allis chalmers production services, inc. safco and delta comprise our rental tool segment and were merged in february 2006 with specialty to form allis chalmers rental tools, inc. our gross margin for the year ended december 31, 2005 increased 146.1 to 30.6 million, or 29.0 of revenues, compared to 12.4 million, or 26.0 , of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase is due to increased revenues and improved pricing in the directional drilling services segment, increased revenues at our compressed air drilling services segment, including revenues resulting from the acquisition of diamond air and the compressed air drilling assets of w.t., increased revenues from mexico, improved market conditions for our domestic casing and tubing segment and the growth of our rental tools segment through the acquisition of delta on april 1, 2005. depreciation expense increased 80.4 to 4.9 million in 2005 compared to 2.7 million in 2004. the increase is due to additional depreciable assets resulting from capital expenditures and acquisitions in 2004 and 2005. our cost of revenues consists principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of our equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. because many of our costs are fixed, our gross profit as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues. general and administrative expense was 15.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2005 compared to 7.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. general and administrative expense increased due to the additional expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in the second half of 2004 and in 2005, and the hiring of additional sales and administrative personnel. general and administrative expense also increased because of increased legal and accounting fees and other expenses related to our financing and acquisition activities, increased consulting fees in connection with our internal controls and corporate governance process, and increased corporate accounting and administrative staff. as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 15.1 for 2005 and 14.9 for 2004. amortization expense was 1.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2005 compared to 0.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions and the amortization of deferred financing costs. income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2005 totaled 13.2 million, a 212.7 increase over the 4.2 million in income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2004, reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross profit, offset in part by increased general and administrative expenses. our interest expense was 4.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, compared to 2.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. interest expense increased during 2005 due to the increased borrowings associated with the acquisitions completed in the second and third quarters of 2005, equipment purchases and higher average interest rates, offset in part by the prepayment, in december 2004, of our 12 2.4 million subordinated note. additionally, in 2005, we incurred debt retirement expense of 1.1 million related to the refinancing of our debt. this amount includes prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred financing fees from a previous financing. minority interest in income of subsidiaries for the year ended december 31, 2005 was 488,000 compared to 321,000 for the corresponding period in 2004 due to the increase in profitability at aircomp due in part to the acquisition of diamond air as of november 1, 2004. the minority interest at aircomp was acquired on july 11, 2005 and the minority interest in tubular, which was 19 owned by director jens mortensen, was acquired on september 30, 2004. we had net income attributed to common stockholders of 7.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of 839.1 , compared to net income attributed to common stockholders of 0.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the net income attributed to common stockholders in the 2004 period is after 124,000 in preferred stock dividends. 23 table of contents the following table compares revenues and income from operations for each of our business segments for the years ended december 31, 2005 and december 31, 2004. income from operations consists of our revenues less cost of revenues, general and administrative expenses, and

directional drilling services segment were 43.9 million, an increase of 77.1 from the 24.8 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2004. income from operations increased 141.4 to 7.4 million for 2005 from 3.1 million for 2004. the improved results for this segment are due to the increase in drilling activity in the texas and gulf coast areas, the establishment of new operations in west texas and oklahoma, the addition of operations and sales personnel, the purchase of additional downhole motors which increased our capacity and market presence and the acquisition of target, a provider of measurement while drilling equipment, effective august 2005. our operating income increased due to higher revenue explained above and cost savings achieved as a result of the purchases of most of the downhole motors used in directional drilling, which we had previously rented. compressed air drilling services segment. our compressed air drilling revenues were 25.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of 122.0 compared to 11.6 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2004. income from operations increased 380.1 to 5.6 million in 2005 compared to income from operations of 1.2 million in 2004. our compressed air drilling revenues and operating income for the 2005 period increased compared to the 2004 period due in part to the acquisition of the air drilling assets of w. t., the acquisitions of diamond air as of november 1, 2004 and improved pricing in west texas. casing and tubing services segment. revenues for the year ended december 31, 2005 for the casing and tubing services segment were 20.9 million, an increase of 101.4 from the 10.4 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2004. revenues from domestic operations increased to 14.5 million in 2005 from 5.2 million in 2004 as a result of the acquisition of the casing and tubing assets of patterson services, inc. on september 1, 2005, improved market conditions for our services in south texas and the addition of personnel which added to our capabilities and our offering of services. revenues from mexican operations increased to 6.4 million in 2005 from 5.2 million in 2004 as a result of increased drilling activity in mexico and the addition of equipment that increased our capacity. income from operations increased 55.2 to 5.0 million in 2005 from 3.2 million in 2004. the increase in this segment s operating income is due to increased revenues both domestically and in our mexico operations. rental tools segment. our rental tools revenues were 5.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, an increase of 728.0 compared to 0.6 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2004. income from operations increased to 1.3 million in 2005 compared to a loss from operations of 71,000 in 2004. operations for this segment include safco, acquired in september 2004, and delta, acquired in april 2005. production services segment. our production services revenues were 9.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2005, compared to 376,000 in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2004. loss from operations was 99,000 in 2005 compared to an operating income of 4,000 in 2004. operations for this segment consist of downhole, acquired december 1, 2004, and capcoil, acquired may 1, 2005. we plan to grow this segment and improve profitability by increasing our market presence and our critical mass including 24 table of contents adding additional capillary and coil tubing units. our results for the year ended december 31, 2005 for this segment were negatively affected by costs incurred to expand our international presence for production services and by downtime experienced by one of our larger coil tubing units. comparison of years ended december 31, 2004 and december 31, 2003 our revenue for the year ended december 31, 2004 was 47.7 million, an increase of 45.8 compared to 32.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2003. revenues increased due to increased demand for our services due to the general increase in oil and gas drilling activity. revenues increased most significantly at our directional drilling services segment due to the addition of operations and sales personnel, which increased our capacity and market presence. additionally, our compressed air drilling services revenues in 2004 increased compared to the 2003 year due to the inclusion, for a full year in 2004, of the business contributed by m i in connection with the formation of aircomp in july 2003 and the acquisition of diamond air on november 1, 2004. we have consolidated aircomp into our financial statements beginning with the quarter ended september 30, 2003. also contributing to the increase in revenues was an increase in mexico revenues at our casing and tubing services segment, which was offset in part by a decrease in domestic revenues for this segment due to increased competition for casing and tubing services in south texas. finally in the second half of 2004, we acquired safco, our rental tools subsidiary, as of september 1, and as of december 1, 2004, we acquired downhole, our production services subsidiary. our gross margin for the year ended december 31, 2004 increased 42.9 to 12.4 million, or 26.0 of revenues, compared to 8.7 million, or 26.6 of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2003, due to the increase in revenues in the directional drilling services segment, the compressed air drilling services segment and from mexico, which more than offset lower revenues and higher costs in our domestic casing and tubing segment. our cost of revenues consists principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of our equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. because many of our costs are fixed, our gross profit as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues. general and administrative expense was 7.1 million in the 2004 period compared to 5.3 million for 2003. general and administrative expense increased in 2004 due to additional expenses associated with the inclusion of aircomp for a full year, the acquisitions completed in the second half of 2004, and the hiring of additional sales and administrative personnel at each of our subsidiaries. general and administrative expense also increased because of increased professional fees and other expenses related to our financing and acquisition activities, including the listing of our common stock on the american stock exchange, and increased corporate accounting and administrative staff. as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 14.9 in 2004 and 16.2 in 2003. depreciation and amortization was 3.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2004 compared to 2.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2003. the increase was due to the inclusion of aircomp for a full year and the increase in our assets resulting from our capital expenditures and the acquisitions completed in 2004. income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2004 totaled 4.2 million, a 61.0 increase over the 2.6 million in income from operations for the prior year, reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross profit, offset in part by an increase in general and administrative expense. income from operations in the year ended december 31, 2004 includes 188,000 in additional accrued expense for post retirement medical benefits pursuant to our plan of reorganization. the increase in this accrued expense was based on the present value of the expected retiree benefit obligations as determined by a third party actuary. income from operations for the 2003 year includes income of 99,000 which resulted from a reduction in projected post retirement benefits based on the third party actuary at the end of 2003. our interest expense increased to 2.8 million in 2004, compared to 2.5 million for the prior year, in spite of the decrease in our total debt. interest expense in 2004 includes 359,000 in warrant put amortization including the retirement of warrants in connection with the prepayment, in december 2004, of our 2.4 million 12.0 subordinated note. interest expense in 2003 includes 216,000 in connection with the acceleration, in 2003, of the amortization of a put obligation related to subordinated debt at mountain compressed air. the 25 table of contents subordinated debt including accrued interest was paid off in connection with the formation of aircomp in 2003. minority interest in income of subsidiaries for the 2004 year was 321,000 compared to 343,000 for the 2003 year. the increase in net income at aircomp was offset in part by the elimination of minority interest in tubular, which was 19 owned by director jens mortensen until september 30, 2004. we had net income attributed to common stockholders of 764,000 for the year ended december 31, 2004 compared to net income attributed to common stockholders of 2.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2003. in 2003, we recognized a non operating gain on sale of an interest in a subsidiary in the amount of 2.4 million in connection with the formation of aircomp, and recognized a one time gain of 1.0 million in the third quarter of 2003 as a result of settling a lawsuit against the former owners of mountain air drilling. the following table compares revenues and income from operations for each of our business segments for the years ended december 31, 2004 and december 31, 2003. income from operations consists of our

drilling services segment were 24.8 million, an increase of 54.8 from the 16.0 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2003. income from operations increased by 177.5 to 3.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2004 from 1.1 million for 2003. the improved results for this segment are due to the increase in drilling activity in the texas and gulf coast areas and the addition of operations and sales personnel which increased our capacity and market presence. increased operating expenses as a result of the addition of personnel were more than offset by the growth in revenues and cost savings as a result of purchases, in late 2003 and in 2004, of most of the down hole motors used in directional drilling. previously we had leased these motors. compressed air drilling services segment. our compressed air drilling revenues were 11.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2004, an increase of 73.1 compared to 6.7 million in revenues for the year ended december 31,

in the 2004 period as a result of increased drilling activity in mexico and the addition of equipment that increased our capacity. income from operations decreased by 11.3 to 3.2 million in 2004 from

approximately 15.0 million in 2006, exclusive of any acquisitions. we believe that our current cash generated from operations, cash available under our credit facilities and cash on hand will provide sufficient funds for our identified projects. we intend to implement a growth strategy of increasing the scope of services through both internal growth and acquisitions. we are regularly involved in discussions with a number of potential acquisition candidates. we expect to make capital expenditures to acquire and to maintain our existing equipment. our performance and cash flow from operations will be determined by the demand for our services which in turn are affected by our customers expenditures for oil and gas exploration and development and industry perceptions and expectations of future oil and gas prices in the areas where we operate. we will need to refinance our existing debt facilities as they become due and provide funds for capital expenditures and acquisitions. to effect our expansion plans, we will require additional equity or debt financing in excess of our current working capital and amounts available under credit facilities. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the additional debt or equity capital or that we can do so on terms that will be acceptable to us. recent developments in january of 2006, we acquired 100 of the

million principal amount of our 9.0 senior notes due 2014, which we refer to as our senior notes. the proceeds of the offering were used to fund the acquisition of specialty, to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes. in january of 2006, we amended and restated our july 2005 credit agreement to increase our borrowing capacity by exchanging the existing two year 55.0 million facility for a new four year 25.0 million facility. we refer to the july 2005 credit agreement, as so amended and restated, as our new credit agreement. all amounts outstanding under the previous 55.0 million credit facility were repaid with proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes. the new credit agreement s interest rate is based on a margin over libor or the prime rate, and there is a 0.5 fee for the undrawn portion. the credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets. as of march 15, 2006, there are no borrowings under this facility. in january

term and equipment loans. in february of 2006, david groshoff resigned from our board of directors and the audit committee. mr. groshoff served on our board since 1999, initially under an agreement on behalf of the pension benefit guaranty corporation, which is a client of mr. groshoff s employer. that agreement permitted the pbgc to appoint a member to our board so long as the pbgc held a minimum number of shares of allis chalmers stock. the pbgc sold all its stock in allis chalmers in august 2005. as an investment management employee of jpmorgan asset management, mr. groshoff is subject to his employer s policies which generally prohibit employees from serving on public company boards of directors without a meaningful client interest in such companies. in light of the pbgc s sale of allis chalmers stock, these policies required mr. groshoff s resignation from our board. in march 2006, robert nederlander was appointed to the audit committee to replace mr. groshoff. through march 13, 2006, we received proceeds of approximately 784,000 from the exercise of 313,000 warrants. 33 table of contents critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. our preparation of this report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. allowance for doubtful accounts. the determination of the collectibility of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends, including monitoring our customer payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectibility is reasonably assured, as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our customers operate. those uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our customers ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident that the customers will not be able to make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. revenue recognition. we provide rental equipment and drilling services to our customers at per day and per job contractual rates and recognize the drilling related revenue as the work progresses and when collectibility is reasonably assured. the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no. 104, revenue recognition in financial statements, provides guidance on the sec staff s views on application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues. our revenue recognition policy is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no. 104. impairment of long lived assets. long lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, comprise a significant amount of our total assets. we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives. additionally, the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable. this requires us to make long term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. these forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. goodwill and other intangibles. as of december 31, 2005, we have recorded approximately 12.4 million of goodwill and 6.8 million of other identifiable intangible assets. we perform purchase price allocations to intangible assets when we make a business combination. business combinations and purchase price allocations have been consummated for acquisitions in all of our reportable segments. the excess of the purchase price after allocation of fair values to tangible assets is allocated to identifiable intangibles and thereafter to goodwill. subsequently, we perform our initial impairment tests and annual impairment tests in accordance with financial accounting standards board no. 141, business combinations, and financial accounting standards board no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets. these initial valuations used two approaches to determine the carrying amount of the individual reporting units. the first approach is the discounted cash flow method, which focuses on our expected cash flow. in applying this approach, the cash flow available for distribution is projected for a finite period of years. cash flow available for distribution is defined as the amount of cash that could be distributed as a dividend without impairing our future profitability or operations. the cash flow available for distribution and the terminal value our value at the end of the estimation period are then discounted to present value to derive an indication of value of the business enterprise. this valuation method is dependent upon the assumptions made regarding future cash flow and cash requirements. the second approach is the guideline company method which focuses on comparing us to 34 table of contents selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies. under this method, valuation multiples are i derived from operating data of selected similar companies ii evaluated and adjusted based on our strengths and weaknesses relative to the selected guideline companies and iii applied to our operating data to arrive at an indication of value. this valuation method is dependent upon the assumption that our value can be evaluated by analysis of our earnings and our strengths and weaknesses relative to the selected similar companies. significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. recently issued accounting standards in may 2005, the fasb issued sfas no. 154, accounting changes and error corrections. sfas no. 154 requires retroactive application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period financial statements unless it is impracticable. sfas no. 154 also requires that a change in method of depreciation, amortization or depletion for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. sfas no. 154 replaces apb opinion no. 20, accounting changes and sfas no. 3, reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements . sfas no. 154 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2005. we will adopt the provisions of sfas no. 154 as of january 1, 2006 and do not expect that its adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. in december 2004, the fasb issued sfas no. 123r, share based payment. sfas 123r revises sfas no. 123, accounting for stock based compensation, and focuses on accounting for share based payments for services by employer to employee. the statement requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. we have adopted sfas 123r as of january 1, 2006 and will use the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the black scholes option pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. under the modified prospective method, stock option awards that are granted, modified or settled after january 1, 2006 will be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas no. 123 r . compensation cost for awards granted prior to, but not vested, as of january 1, 2006 would be based on the grant date attributes originally used to value those awards for pro forma purposes under sfas no. 123. we believe that the adoption of this standard will result in an expense of approximately 3.2 million, or a reduction in diluted earnings per share of approximately 0.18 per share for the full calendar year 2006. this estimate assumes no additional grants of stock options beyond those outstanding as of december 31, 2005. we have retained the services of a compensation consulting firm to advise us on alternatives for long term incentive programs, including the future use of stock options, if any, and other forms of incentive compensation. this estimate is based on many assumptions including the level of stock option grants expected in 2006, our stock price, and significant assumptions in the option valuation model including volatility and the expected life of options. actual expenses could differ from the estimate. in november 2004, the fasb issued sfas no. 151, inventory costs an amendment of arb no. 43, chapter 4, which amends the guidance in arb no. 43 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. sfas no. 151 requires that these items be recognized as current period charges. in addition, sfas no. 151 requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. we are required to adopt provisions of sfas 151, on a prospective basis, as of january 1, 2006. we do not believe the adoption of sfas 151 will have a material impact on our future results of operations. risk factors this annual report on form 10 k including without limitation the following risk factors contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. words such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended to identify forward looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying forward looking statements in this annual report on form 10 k. 35 table of contents although forward looking statements in this annual report on form 10 k reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors we currently know about. consequently, forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10 k and in our other sec filings and publicly available documents. readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this annual report on form 10 k. we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this annual report on form 10 k. risks associated with an investment in our common stock our stock price may decrease in response to various factors, which could adversely affect our business and cause our stockholders to suffer significant losses. these factors include decreases in prices for oil and natural gas resulting in decreased demand for our services variations in our operating results and failure to meet expectations of investors and analysts increases in interest rates the loss of customers failure of customers to pay for our services competition illiquidity of the market for our common stock sales of common stock by existing stockholders and other developments affecting us or the financial markets. a reduced stock price will result in a loss to investors and will adversely affect our ability to issue stock to fund our activities. existing stockholders interest in us may be diluted by additional issuances of equity securities. we expect to issue additional equity securities to fund the acquisition of additional businesses and pursuant to employee benefit plans. we may also issue additional equity for other purposes. these securities may be on parity with our common stock or may have dividend, liquidation, or other preferences to our common stock. the issuance of additional equity securities will dilute the holdings of existing stockholders and may reduce the share price of our common stock. we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock and investors will be able to receive cash in respect of the shares of common stock only upon the sale of the shares. we have not within the last ten years paid any cash dividends on our common stock. we have no intention in the foreseeable future to pay any cash dividends on our common stock and our new credit agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. therefore an investor in our common stock, in all likelihood, will obtain an economic benefit from the common stock only by selling the common stock. 36 table of contents risks associated with our indebtedness we have a substantial amount of debt which could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from making principal and interest payments on our senior notes and our other debt. as of december 31, 2005, after giving effect to the sale of the senior notes in january of 2006, the application of the proceeds therefrom, and the closing of our new credit agreement, as if each such transaction had occurred on that date, we had approximately 168.2 million of consolidated total indebtedness outstanding and approximately 24.4 million of additional secured borrowing capacity available under our new credit agreement. our substantial debt could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our senior notes and our other debt increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including declines in oil and natural gas prices and declines in drilling activities limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, mergers and other general corporate purposes require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for operations and other purposes limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with the covenants in the indenture relating to our senior notes or in the instruments governing our other debt. in addition, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. the indenture governing our senior notes permits us to incur additional debt, and our new credit agreement permits additional borrowings. if new debt is added to our current debt levels, these related risks could increase. we may not maintain sufficient revenues to sustain profitability or to meet our capital expenditure requirements and our financial obligations. also, we may not be able to generate a sufficient amount of cash flow to meet our debt service obligations. our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to certain financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay scheduled expansion and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. we cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for payment of our debt in the future. in the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt to meet our debt service and other obligations, we cannot assure you that the terms of any such transaction would be satisfactory to us or if or how soon any such transaction could be completed. if we fail to obtain additional financing, we may be unable to refinance our existing debt, expand our current operations or acquire new businesses, which could result in a failure to grow or result in defaults in our obligations under our new credit agreement or our senior notes. in order to refinance indebtedness, expand existing operations and acquire additional businesses, we will require substantial amounts of capital. there can be no assurance that financing, whether from equity or debt 37 table of contents financings or other sources, will be available or, if available, will be on terms satisfactory to us. if we are unable to obtain such financing, we will be unable to acquire additional businesses and may be unable to meet our obligations under our new credit agreement or our senior notes. the indenture governing our senior notes and our new credit agreement impose restrictions on us that may limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that, in turn, could impair our ability to meet our obligations under the senior notes. the indenture governing our senior notes and our new credit agreement contain various restrictive covenants that limit management s discretion in operating our business. in particular, these covenants limit our ability to, among other things incur additional debt make certain investments or pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchase or redeem or retire capital stock sell assets, including capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries restrict dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries create liens enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with another company. the new credit agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial tests. our ability to maintain or meet such financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, and we cannot assure you that we will maintain or meet such ratios and tests or that the lenders under the new credit agreement will waive any failure to meet such ratios or tests. these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. furthermore, they may restrict our ability to expand, to pursue our business strategies and otherwise to conduct our business. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply. a breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing our senior notes and or the new credit agreement. if there were an event of default under the indenture governing our senior notes and or the new credit agreement, the affected creditors could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately. additionally, if we fail to repay indebtedness under our new credit agreement when it becomes due, the lenders under the new credit agreement could proceed against the assets which we have pledged to them as security. our assets and cash flow might not be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt in the event of a default. risks associated with our company we may fail to acquire additional businesses, which will restrict our growth and may result in a decrease in our stock price. our business strategy is to acquire companies operating in the oil and natural gas equipment rental and services industry. however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring any additional companies. successful acquisition of new companies will depend on various factors, including but not limited to our ability to obtain financing the competitive environment for acquisitions and the integration and synergy issues described in the next risk factor. 38 table of contents there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire and successfully operate any particular business or that we will be able to expand into areas that we have targeted. the price of the common stock may fall if we fail to acquire additional businesses. difficulties in integrating acquired businesses may result in reduced revenues and income. we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses of our operating subsidiaries or any business we may acquire in the future. the integration of the businesses will be complex and time consuming, will place a significant strain on management, and may disrupt our businesses. we may be adversely impacted by unknown liabilities of acquired businesses. we may encounter substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in integrating common accounting, information and communication systems, operating procedures, internal controls and human resources practices, including incompatibility of business cultures and the loss of key employees and customers. these difficulties may reduce our ability to gain customers or retain existing customers, and may increase operating expenses, resulting in reduced revenues and income and a failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. in particular, our recent acquisition of specialty has been our largest acquisition to date and may pose greater integration risks than our previous acquisitions. furthermore, by acquiring specialty with cash from the proceeds of our recent senior notes offering, we will depend on specialty s continued performance as a source of cash flow to service our debt obligations. we have made numerous acquisitions during the past five years. as a result of these transactions, our past performance is not indicative of future performance, and investors should not base their expectations as to our future performance on our historical results. failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and or internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our operations. as disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement, we understated diluted earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2003, for each of the first three quarters of 2004, for the years ended december 31, 2003 and 2004 and for the quarter ended march 31, 2005. in addition, we understated basic earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended september 30, 2004. consequently, we have restated our financial statements for each of those periods. the incorrect calculation resulted from a mathematical error and an improper application of statement of financial accounting standards, or sfas, no. 128, earnings per share. management has concluded that the need to restate our financial statements resulted, in part, from the lack of sufficient experienced accounting personnel, which in turn resulted in a lack of effective control over the financial reporting process. in addition, as part of our growth strategy, we have recently completed several acquisitions of privately held businesses, including closely held entities, and in the future, we may make additional strategic acquisitions of privately held businesses. prior to becoming part of our consolidated company, these acquired businesses have not been required to implement or maintain the disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting that federal law requires of publicly held companies such as ours. similarly, it is likely that our future acquired businesses will not have been required to maintain such disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls prior to their acquisition. we are in the process of creating and implementing appropriate disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting at each of our recently acquired businesses. however, we have not yet completed this process and cannot assure you as to when the process will be complete. likewise, upon the completion of any future acquisition, we will be required to integrate the acquired business into our consolidated company s system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, but we cannot assure you as to how long the integration process may take for any business that we may acquire. furthermore, during the integration 39 table of contents process, we may not be able to fully implement our consolidated disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting. also, during the fourth quarter of 2005, we failed to timely file a current report on form 8 k relating to the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with recent stock option and warrant exercises. the current report, which was due to be filed in november 2005, was filed in february 2006. as a result of the issues described above, our management has concluded that, as of the end of periods covered by the restatements and as of december 31, 2005, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to enable us to record, process, summarize and report information required to be included in our sec filings within the required time periods, and to ensure that such information is accumulated and reported to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial accounting officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. as more fully described below under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement, we have implemented a number of actions that we believe address the deficiencies in our financial reporting process and will improve our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting. however, we cannot yet assert that the remediation is or will be effective as we have not yet had sufficient time to test the newly implemented actions. we are in the process of documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments. we have also retained the services of an independent consultant to assist us with the documenting and testing process. during the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies and or one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by sec rules under the sarbanes oxley act for compliance with the requirements of section 404. in addition, if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our disclosure controls and procedures and or our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective disclosure controls and procedures and or effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act. if we are not successful in improving our financial reporting process, our disclosure controls and procedures and or our internal controls over financial reporting or if we identify deficiencies and or one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to attest that our management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting is fairly stated, or they may be unable to express an opinion on our management s evaluation of, or on the effectiveness of, our internal controls. if it is determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and or our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, we may not be able to provide reliable financial and other reports or prevent fraud, which, in turn, could harm our business and operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and or adversely affect our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the sec. any failure to timely file our periodic reports with the sec may give rise to a default under the indenture governing our senior notes and, ultimately, an acceleration of amounts due under the senior notes. in addition, a default under the indenture generally will also give rise to a default under our new credit agreement and could cause the acceleration of amounts due under the new credit agreement. if an acceleration of our senior notes or our other debt were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds to repay such obligations. the loss of key executives would adversely affect our ability to effectively finance and manage our business, acquire new businesses, and obtain and retain customers. we are dependent upon the efforts and skills of our executives to finance and manage our business, identify and consummate additional acquisitions and obtain and retain customers. these executives include chief executive officer and chairman munawar h. hidayatallah and president and chief operating officer david wilde. 40 table of contents in addition, our development and expansion will require additional experienced management and operations personnel. no assurance can be given that we will be able to identify and retain these employees. the loss of the services of one or more of our key executives could increase our exposure to the other risks described in this risk factors section. we do not maintain key man insurance on any of our personnel. historically, we have been dependent on a few customers operating in a single industry, the loss of one or more could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our customers are engaged in the oil and natural gas drilling business in the united states, mexico and elsewhere. historically, we have been dependent upon a few customers for a significant portion of our revenue. in 2004, matyep and burlington resources represented 10.8 and 10.1 respectively, of our revenues. in 2003, matyep, burlington resources and el paso corporation represented 10.2 , 11.1 and 14.1 , respectively, of our revenues. this concentration of customers may increase our overall exposure to credit risk, and customers will likely be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. our financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected if one or more of our significant customers fails to pay us or ceases to contract with us for our services on terms that are favorable to us or at all. our international operations may expose us to political and other uncertainties, including risks of terrorist acts, war and civil disturbances changes in laws or policies regarding the award of contracts and the inability to collect or repatriate income or capital. part of our strategy is to prudently and opportunistically acquire businesses and assets that complement our existing products and services, and to expand our geographic footprint. if we make acquisitions in other countries, we may increase our exposure to the risks discussed above. environmental liabilities could result in substantial losses. since our reorganization under the u.s. federal bankruptcy laws in 1988, a number of parties, including the environmental protection agency, have asserted that we are responsible for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites with respect to our pre bankruptcy activities. we believe that such claims are barred by applicable bankruptcy law, and we have not experienced any material expense in relation to any such claims. however, if we do not prevail with respect to these claims in the future, or if additional environmental claims are asserted against us relating to our current or future activities in the oil and natural gas industry, we could become subject to material environmental liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. products liability claims relating to discontinued operations could result in substantial losses. since our reorganization under the u.s. federal bankruptcy laws in 1988, we have been regularly named in products liability lawsuits primarily resulting from the manufacture of products containing asbestos. in connection with our bankruptcy, a special products liability trust was established to address products liability claims. we believe that claims against us are barred by applicable bankruptcy law, and that the products liability trust will continue to be responsible for products liability claims. since 1988, no court has ruled that we are responsible for products liability claims. however, if we are held responsible for product liability claims, we could suffer substantial losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. we have not manufactured products containing asbestos since our reorganization in 1988. 41 table of contents we may be subject to claims for personal injury and property damage, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our products and services are used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. these operations are subject to inherent hazards that can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment, the environment and marine life, and suspension of operations. litigation arising from an accident at a location where our products or services are used or provided may cause us to be named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims. we maintain customary insurance to protect our business against these potential losses. our insurance has deductibles or self insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions. however, we could become subject to material uninsured liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. risks associated with our industry cyclical declines in oil and natural gas prices may result in reduced use of our services, affecting our business, financial condition and results of operation and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments. the oil and natural gas exploration and drilling business is highly cyclical. generally, as oil and natural gas prices decrease, exploration and drilling activity declines as marginally profitable projects become uneconomic and are either delayed or eliminated. declines in the number of operating drilling rigs result in reduced use of and prices for our services. accordingly, when oil and natural gas prices are relatively low, our revenues and income will suffer. oil and natural gas prices depend on many factors beyond our control, including the following economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas the level of production of the organization of petroleum exporting countries, commonly called opec the level of production of non opec countries the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas political conditions, including embargoes, in or affecting other oil and natural gas producing activities the level of global oil and natural gas inventories and advances in exploration, development and production technologies. depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail their drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for drilling services. our contracts are generally short term, and oil and natural gas companies tend to respond quickly to upward or downward changes in prices. any reduction in the demand for drilling services may materially erode both pricing and utilization rates for our services and adversely affect our financial results. as a result, we may suffer losses, be unable to make necessary capital expenditures and be unable to meet our financial obligations. our industry is highly competitive, with intense price competition. the markets in which we operate are highly competitive. contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. the competitive environment has intensified as recent mergers among oil and natural gas companies have reduced the number of available customers. many other oilfield services companies are larger than us and have greater resources than we have. these competitors are better able to withstand industry downturns, compete on the basis of price and acquire new equipment and technologies, all of which could affect our revenues and profitability. these competitors compete with us both for customers and for acquisitions of other businesses. this competition may cause our business to suffer. we believe that competition for contracts will continue to be intense in the foreseeable future. 42 table of contents we may experience increased labor costs or the unavailability of skilled workers and the failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations. companies in our industry, including us, are dependent upon the available labor pool of skilled employees. we compete with other oilfield services businesses and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to provide our customers with the highest quality service. we are also subject to the fair labor standards act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions. a shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages. there can be no assurance that labor costs will not increase. any increase in our operating costs could cause our business to suffer. severe weather could have a material adverse impact on our business. our business could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather. repercussions of severe weather conditions may include curtailment of services weather related damage to facilities and equipment resulting in suspension of operations inability to deliver materials to job sites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity. in addition, oil and natural gas operations of our customers located offshore and onshore in the gulf of mexico and in mexico may be adversely affected by hurricanes and tropical storms, resulting in reduced demand for our services. further, our customers operations in the mid continent and rocky mountain regions of the united states are also adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions. this limits our access to these job sites and our ability to service wells in these areas. these constraints decrease drilling activity and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. our business may be affected by terrorist activity and by security measures taken in response to terrorism. we may experience loss of business or delays or defaults in payments from payers that have been affected by actual or potential terrorist activities. some oil and natural gas drilling companies have implemented security measures in response to potential terrorist activities, including access restrictions, that could adversely affect our ability to market our services to new and existing customers and could increase our costs. terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely impact our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely affect our ability to grow our business. we are subject to government regulations. we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the energy industry in general and the environment in particular. environmental laws have in recent years become more stringent and have generally sought to impose greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties. although we are not aware of any proposed material changes in any federal, state and local statutes, rules or regulations, any changes could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. 43 table of contents item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk. we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange risks. interest rate risk fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable rate debt obligations expose us to market risk. we are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt and on any future repricing or refinancing of our fixed rate debt and on future debt. at december 31, 2005, we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations on approximately 49.0 million of notes payable and bank credit facility borrowings carrying variable interest rates. a hypothetical one hundred basis point increase in interest rates for these notes payable would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 490,000. due to the uncertainty of fluctuations in interest rates and the specific actions that might be taken by us to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations and their possible effects, the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure. we have also been subject to interest rate market risk for short term invested cash and cash equivalents. the principal of such invested funds would not be subject to fluctuating value because of their highly liquid short term nature. as of december 31, 2005, we had 1.1 million invested in short term maturing investments. foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in mexico through our mexican partner, matyep. this business exposes us to foreign exchange risk. to control this risk, we provide for payment in u.s. dollars. however, we have historically provided our partner a discount upon payment equal to 50 of any loss suffered by our partner as a result of devaluation of the mexican peso between the date of invoicing and the date of payment. during 2005 and 2004 the discounts have not exceeded 10,000 per year. 44 table of contents item 8. financial statements.

nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies organization of business allis chalmers energy inc. allis chalmers or we was incorporated in delaware in 1913. oilquip rentals, inc. oilquip , an oil and gas rental company, was incorporated on february 4, 2000 to find and acquire acquisition targets to operate as subsidiaries. on february 6, 2001, oilquip, through its subsidiary, mountain compressed air inc. mountain air , a texas corporation, acquired certain assets of mountain air drilling service co., inc, whose business consisted of providing equipment and trained personnel in the four corners area of the southwestern united states. mountain air primarily provided compressed air equipment and related products and services and trained operators to companies in the business of drilling for natural gas. on may 9, 2001, oilquip merged into a subsidiary of allis chalmers energy inc. in the merger, all of oilquip s outstanding common stock was converted into 2.0 million shares of allis chalmers common stock. for legal purposes, allis chalmers acquired oilquip, the parent company of mountain air. however, for accounting purposes, oilquip was treated as the acquiring company in a reverse acquisition of allis chalmers. on february 6, 2002, we acquired 81 of the outstanding stock of allis chalmers tubular services inc. tubular , formerly known as jens oilfield service, inc., which supplies highly specialized equipment and operations to install casing and production tubing required to drill and complete oil and gas wells. on february 2, 2002, we

contributed by mountain air were recorded at mountain air s historical cost of 6.3 million, and the assets contributed by m i were recorded at fair market value of 10.3 million. we originally owned 55

services segment. on september 23, 2004, we acquired 100 of the outstanding stock of safco oil field products, inc. safco for 1.0 million. safco leases spiral drill pipe and provides related oilfield services to the oil drilling industry. on september 30, 2004, we acquired the remaining 19 of tubular in exchange for 1.3 million shares of our common stock. the total value of the consideration paid to the seller, jens mortensen, was 6.4 million which was equal to the number of shares of common stock issued to mr. mortensen multiplied by the last sale price 4.95 of the common stock as reported on the american stock exchange on the date of issuance. on november 10, 2004, aircomp acquired substantially all the assets of diamond air drilling services, inc. and marquis bit co., l.l.c. collectively

states of texas, utah, louisiana, colorado, oklahoma, and new mexico, the gulf of mexico and southern portions of mexico. the nature of our operations and the many regions in which we operate subject us to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions. we are vulnerable to near term and long term changes in the demand for and prices of oil and natural gas and the related demand for oilfield service operations. use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty. accordingly, our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. while management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. estimates are used for, but are not limited to, determining the following allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of long lived assets and intangibles, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes and valuation allowances. the accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 52 table of contents allis chalmers energy inc. notes to consolidated financial statements continued may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of allis chalmers and its subsidiaries. our subsidiaries at december 31, 2005 are oil quip, mountain air, tubular, strata, aircomp, safco, downhole, delta, capcoil and target. all significant inter company transactions have been eliminated. revenue recognition we provide rental equipment and drilling services to our customers at per day and per job contractual rates and recognize the drilling related revenue as the work progresses and when collectibility is reasonably assured. the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no. 104, revenue recognition in financial statements sab no. 104 , provides guidance on the sec staff s views on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues. our revenue recognition policy is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no. 104. allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. we sell our services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. we perform continuing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and although we generally does not require collateral, letters of credit may be required from customers in certain circumstances. we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that are determined uncollectible. we have a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given date. any unanticipated change in any one of these customer s credit worthiness or other matters affecting the collectibility of amounts due from such customers could have a material effect on the results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur. after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. as of december 31, 2005 and 2004, we had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of 383,000 and 265,000 respectively. bad debt expense was 219,000, 104,000 and 136,000 for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. cost is determined using the first in, first out fifo method or the average cost method, which approximates fifo, and includes the cost of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. certain equipment held under capital leases are classified as equipment and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities. maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life of the related assets, are charged to operations when incurred. refurbishments and renewals are capitalized when the value of the equipment is enhanced for an extended period. when property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset 53 table of contents allis chalmers energy inc. notes to consolidated financial statements continued account and related accumulated depreciation account are relieved, and any gain or loss is included in operations. the cost of property and equipment currently in service is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to twenty years. depreciation is computed on the straight line method for financial reporting purposes. capital leases are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and lease amortization is included in depreciation expense. depreciation expense charged to operations was 4.9 million, 2.7 million and 2.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. goodwill, intangible assets and amortization goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity method investments, and other intangible assets with infinite lives are not amortized, but tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized either on a straight line basis over the asset s estimated useful life or on a basis that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are realized. we perform impairment tests on the carrying value of our goodwill on an annual basis as of december 31st for each of our reportable segments. as of december 31, 2005 and 2004, no evidence of impairment exists. impairment of long lived assets long lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, and certain other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable. the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, excluding interest expense. the impairment loss is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flow analysis, with the carrying value of the related assets. financial instruments financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and payable, and debt. the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable and payable approximate fair value due to their short term nature. we believe the fair values and the carrying value of our debt would not be materially different due to the instruments interest rates approximating market rates for similar borrowings at december 31, 2005 and 2004. concentration of credit and customer risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. we transact our business with several financial institutions. however, the amount on deposit in two financial institutions exceeded the 100,000 federally insured limit at december 31, 2005 by a total of 2.0 million. management believes that the financial institutions are financially sound and the risk of loss is minimal. we sell our services to major and independent domestic and international oil and gas companies. we perform ongoing credit valuations of our customers and provide allowances for probable credit losses where appropriate. in 2005, none of our customers accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues. in the year ended december 31, 2004, matyep in mexico represented 10.8 , and burlington resources represented 10.1 of our consolidated revenues, respectively. in the year ended december 31, 2003, matyep, burlington 54 table of contents allis chalmers energy inc. notes to consolidated financial statements continued resources, inc., and el paso energy corporation represented 10.2 , 11.1 and 14.1 , respectively, of our consolidated revenues. revenues from matyep represented 94.5 , 98.0 and 100 of our international revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. debt issuance costs the costs related to the issuance of debt are capitalized and amortized to interest expense using the straight line method, which approximates the interest method, over the maturity periods of the related debt. income taxes we use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and tax bases in assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are also provided for certain tax credit carryforwards. a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation using accounting principle board opinion no. 25 apb no. 25 . under apb no. 25, compensation expense is recognized for stock options with an exercise price that is less than the market price on the grant date of the option. for stock options with exercise prices at or

sfas 123 . we also adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no. 123 for the stock options granted to our employees and directors. accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized under apb

earnings per share. diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares e.g., convertible preferred stock, stock options, etc. as if they had been converted. potential dilutive common shares that have an anti dilutive effect e.g., those that increase income per share are excluded from diluted earnings per share. 56 table of contents allis chalmers energy inc. notes to consolidated financial statements continued the components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows in

have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. new accounting pronouncements in may 2005, the fasb issued sfas no. 154, accounting changes and error corrections. sfas no. 154 requires retroactive application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period financial statements unless it is impracticable. sfas no. 154 also requires that a change in the method of depreciation, amortization or depletion for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. sfas no. 154 replaces apb opinion no. 20, accounting changes and sfas no. 3, reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements . sfas no. 154 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2005. we will adopt the provisions of sfas no. 154 as of january 1, 2006 and do not expect that its adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. in december 2004, the fasb issued sfas no. 123r, share based payment. sfas no. 123r revises sfas no. 123, accounting for stock based compensation, and focuses on accounting for share based payments for services by employer to employee. the statement requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. we will adopt sfas no. 123r as of january 1, 2006 and will use the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the black scholes option pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. under the modified prospective method, stock option awards that are granted, modified or settled after january 1, 2006 will be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas no. 123r. compensation cost for awards granted prior to, but not vested, as of january 1, 2006 would be based on the grant date attributes originally used to value those awards for pro forma purposes under 57 table of contents allis chalmers energy inc. notes to consolidated financial statements continued sfas no. 123. we believe that the adoption of this standard will result in an expense of approximately 3.2 million, or a reduction in diluted earnings per share of approximately 0.18 per share. this estimate assumes no additional grants of stock options beyond those outstanding as of december 31, 2005. this estimate is based on many assumptions including the level of stock option grants expected in 2006, our stock price, and significant assumptions in the option valuation model including volatility and the expected life of options. actual expenses could differ from the estimate. in november 2004, the fasb issued sfas no. 151, inventory costs an amendment of arb no. 43, chapter 4, which amends the guidance in arb no. 43 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. sfas no. 151 requires that these items be recognized as current period charges. in addition, sfas no. 151 requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. we are required to adopt provisions of sfas 151, on a prospective basis, as of january 1, 2006. we do not believe the adoption of sfas 151 will have a material impact on our future results of operations. note 2 restatement earnings per share we understated diluted earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2003, for each of the first three quarters of 2004, for the years ended december 31, 2003 and 2004 and for the quarter ended march 31, 2005. in addition, we understated basic earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended september 30, 2004. consequently, we have restated our financial statements for each of those periods. the incorrect calculation resulted from a mathematical error and an improper application of sfas no. 128. the effect of the restatement is to reduce weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2004. consequently, weighted average basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2004 were increased. a restated earnings per share calculation for all affected periods reflecting the above adjustments to our results as previously restated see following section , is presented below amounts

in exchange for a 55 interest and 45 interest, respectively, in aircomp. we originally 59 table of contents allis chalmers energy inc. notes to consolidated financial statements continued accounted for the formation of aircomp as a joint venture. however in february 2005, we determined that the transaction should have been accounted for using purchase accounting pursuant to sfas no. 141, business combinations and recorded the sale of an interest in a subsidiary, in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no. 51, accounting for sales of stock by a subsidiary. consequently, we restated our financial statements for the quarter ended september 30, 2003, for the year ended december 31, 2003 and for the three quarters ended september 30, 2004, to reflect the following adjustments increase in book value of fixed assets. under joint venture accounting, we originally recorded the value of the assets contributed by m i to aircomp at m i s historical cost of 6.9 million. under purchase accounting, we increased the recorded value of the assets contributed by m i by approximately 3.3 million to 10.3 million to reflect their fair market value as determined by a third party appraisal. in addition, under joint venture accounting, we established negative goodwill which reduced fixed assets in the amount of 1.6 million. the negative goodwill was amortized by us over the lives of the related fixed assets. under purchase accounting, we increased fixed assets by 1.6 million to reverse the negative goodwill previously recorded and reversed amortization expenses recorded in 2004. therefore, the cost of fixed assets was increased by a total of 4.9 million at the time of acquisition. as a result of the increase in fixed assets and the reversal of amortization of negative goodwill, depreciation expense increased by 98,000 for the year ended december 31, 2003. increase in minority interest and capital in excess of par value. under purchase accounting, minority interest was increased by 1.5 million, which was partially offset by minority interest expense of 44,000 for the year ended december 31, 2003. under purchase accounting, the capital in excess of par was increased by 955,000. 60 table of contents allis chalmers energy inc. notes to consolidated financial statements continued a restated consolidated balance sheet, reflecting the above

notes. note 16 settlement of lawsuit in june 2003, our subsidiary, mountain air, filed a lawsuit against the former owners of mountain air drilling service company for breach of the asset purchase agreement pursuant to which mountain air acquired mountain air drilling services company, alleging that the sellers stored hazardous materials on the property leased by us without our consent and violated the non compete clause in the asset purchase agreement. on july 15, 2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with the sellers. as of the date of the agreement, we owed the sellers a total of 2.6 million including 2.2 million in principal and approximately 363,000 in accrued interest. as part of the settlement agreement, the note payable to the sellers was reduced from 2.2 million to 1.5 million and the due date of the note payable was extended from february 6, 2006 to september 30, 2007. the lump sum payment due the sellers at that date was 1.9 million. we recorded a one time gain on the reduction of the note payable to the sellers of 1.0 million in the third quarter of 2003. the gain was calculated by discounting the note payable to 1.5 million using a present value calculation and accreting the note payable to 1.9 million the amount due in september 2007. in march 2005, we reached an agreement with the sellers to settle an action brought by the sellers under the note. under the terms of the agreement, we paid 1.0 million in april of 2005 and will pay 350,000 on june 1, 2006 and the remaining 150,000 on june 1, 2007, in settlement of all claims. note 17 gain

liability company named aircomp. both companies contributed assets with a combined value of 16.6 million to aircomp. the contributed assets from mountain air were contributed at a historical book value of approximately 6.3 million and the assets contributed by m i were contributed at a fair market value of approximately 10.3 million. prior to the formation of aircomp, we owned 100 of mountain air and after the formation of aircomp, mountain air owned 55 and m i owned 45 of the business combination. the business combination was accounted for as a purchase and we recorded a one time non operating gain on the sale of the 45 interest in the subsidiary of 80 table of contents allis chalmers energy inc. notes to consolidated financial statements continued approximately 2,433,000. the gain was calculated after recording the assets contributed by m i of approximately 10.3 million less the subordinated note issued to m i in the amount of approximately 4.8 million, recording minority interest of approximately 2,049,000 and an increase in equity of 955,000 in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no. 51 sab 51 . we have not recorded any deferred income taxes because the increase in assets and gain is a permanent timing difference. we have adopted a policy that any gain or loss in the future incurred on the sale in the stock or an interest of a subsidiary would be recognized as such in the income statement. note 18 segment information at december 31, 2005, we had five operating segments including directional drilling services strata and target , compressed air

january of 2006, we acquired 100 of the outstanding stock of specialty rental tools, inc. specialty for 96.0 million in cash. specialty, located in lafayette, louisiana, is engaged in the rental of high quality drill pipe, heavy weight spiral drill pipe, tubing work strings, blow out preventors, choke manifolds and various valves and handling tools for oil and natural gas drilling. during the nine months ended september 30, 2005, specialty generated aggregate revenues of 21.8 million. 84 table of contents allis chalmers energy inc. notes to consolidated financial statements continued in january of 2006, we closed on a private offering, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933, of 160.0 million principal amount of our 9.0 senior notes due 2014, which we refer to as our senior notes. the proceeds of the offering were used to fund the acquisition of specialty, to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes. in january of 2006, we amended and restated our july 2005 credit agreement to increase our borrowing capacity by exchanging the existing two year 55.0 million facility for a new four year 25.0 million facility. we refer to the july 2005 credit agreement, as so amended and restated, as our new credit agreement. all amounts outstanding under the previous 55.0 million credit facility were repaid with proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes. the new credit agreement s interest rate is based on a margin over libor or the prime rate, and there is a 0.5 fee for the undrawn portion. the credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets. in january 2006, with proceeds from the sale of our senior notes we also prepaid the 3.0 million subordinated seller note due to jens mortensen, the 548,000 real estate loan and 430,000 in various outstanding term and equipment loans. in february of 2006, david groshoff resigned from our board of directors and the audit committee. mr. groshoff served on our board since 1999, initially under an agreement on behalf of the pension benefit guaranty corporation, which is a client of mr. groshoff s employer. that agreement permitted the pbgc to appoint a member to our board so long as the pbgc held a minimum number of shares of our stock. the pbgc sold all its holdings in our stock in august 2005. as an investment management employee of jpmorgan asset management, mr. groshoff is subject to his employer s policies which generally prohibit employees from serving on public company boards of directors without a meaningful client interest in such companies. in light of the pbgc s sale of our stock, these policies required mr. groshoff s resignation from our board. in march 2006, robert nederlander was appointed to the audit committee to replace mr. groshoff. through march 13, 2006, we received proceeds of approximately 784,000 from the exercise of 313,000 warrants. 85 table of contents item 9. changes and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure on october 5, 2004, our audit committee dismissed gordon, hughes banks, llp as our independent public accountant and engaged uhy mann frankfort stein lipp cpas, llp as our independent public accountant to review our financial statements beginning with the quarter ending september 30, 2004 and to audit our financial statement for the year ending december 31, 2004. gordon, hughes banks, llp has not audited our prior two fiscal years and accordingly have not expressed an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle. during our two prior fiscal years and through october 5, 2004, there were no disagreements with gordon, hughes banks, llp on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of gordon, hughes banks, llp, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report. prior to october 5, 2004, there were no reportable events as defined in regulation s k item 304 a 1 v of the securities and exchange commission arising out of the services performed by gordon, hughes banks, llp for us. gordon, hughes banks, llp indicated to us that it concurs with the foregoing statements as they relate to gordon, hughes banks, llp and furnished a letter to the securities and exchange commission to this effect. a copy of this letter is an exhibit hereto. prior to october 5, 2004, we did not consult uhy mann frankfort stein lipp cpas, llp regarding i the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction completed or proposed , ii the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, or iii any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement as that term is defined in item 304 a 1 iv of regulation s k of the securities and exchange commission and the related instructions to this item or a reportable event as that term is defined in item 304 a 1 v of regulation s k of the securities and exchange commission. item 9a. controls and procedures a . evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules 13a 15 e and 15d 15 e as of the end of the period covered by this report, which we refer to as the evaluation date. as disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement, we understated diluted earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2003, for each of the first three quarters of 2004, for the years ended december 31, 2003 and 2004 and for the quarter ended march 31, 2005. in addition, we understated basic earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended september 30, 2004. consequently, we have restated our financial statements for each of those periods. the incorrect calculation resulted from a mathematical error and an improper application of statement of financial accounting standards, or sfas, no. 128, earnings per share. management has concluded that the need to restate our financial statements resulted, in part, from the lack of sufficient experienced accounting personnel, which in turn resulted in a lack of effective control over the financial reporting process. 86 table of contents as part of our growth strategy over the past five years, we have completed acquisitions of several privately held businesses, including closely held entities. prior to becoming part of our consolidated company, these businesses were not required to implement or maintain, and did not implement or maintain, the disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting that federal law requires of publicly held companies such as ours. we are in the process of creating and implementing appropriate disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting at each of our recently acquired businesses. however, we have not yet completed this process and cannot assure you as to when the process will be complete. in addition, during the fourth quarter of 2005, we failed to timely file a current report on form 8 k relating to the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with recent stock option and warrant exercises. the current report, which was due to be filed in november 2005, was filed in february 2006. as a result of the issues described above, our management has concluded that, as of the evaluation date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in enabling us to record, process, summarize and report information required to be included in our sec filings within the required time period, and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial accounting officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. b . change in internal control over financial reporting. there were the following changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a 15 f and 15d 15 f under the exchange act that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting we continued the engagement of an independent internal controls consulting firm which is in the process of documenting, analyzing, identifying and testing internal controls. in march 2005, we hired a certified public accountant as our financial reporting manager. in july 2005, we hired a certified public accountant who has prior experience as a chief accounting officer of a publicly traded company to be our chief accounting officer. during the year we started the implementation of new accounting software and as of december 31, 2005, all but one of our segments was utilizing the software. part iii
