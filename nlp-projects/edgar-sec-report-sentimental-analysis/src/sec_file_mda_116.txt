item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the three months ended june 30, 2003 and 2002 summary amr corporation's amr or the company net loss during the second quarter of 2003 was 75 million, or .47 per share, as compared to a net loss of 495 million, or 3.19 per share for the same period in 2002. amr's operating earnings of 87 million increased 688 million compared to the same period in 2002. the company's second quarter 2003 results include 358 million in security cost reimbursements received under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act, 2003 the act see note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information . amr's principal subsidiary is american airlines, inc. american . the company's second quarter 2003 revenues continued to decrease year over year, but at a slower rate than its capacity. in april, the company's revenues continued to be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown, the war in iraq and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars . in may and june however, these trends reversed and while capacity was down year over year, the company showed unit revenue passenger revenue per available seat mile improvement. overall, the company's revenues decreased approximately 184 million, or 4.1 percent, to 4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2003 from the same period last year. american's passenger revenues decreased by 5.4 percent, or 203 million, in the second quarter of 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002. american's second quarter domestic passenger revenue per available seat mile rasm however, increased 4.0 percent, to 8.81 cents, on a capacity decrease of 9.6 percent, to 29.0 billion available seat miles asms . international rasm decreased to 8.57 cents, or 1.2 percent, on a capacity decrease of 2.7 percent. the decrease in international rasm was due to a 20.3 percent and 1.8 percent decrease in pacific and latin american rasm, respectively, slightly offset by a 2.4 percent increase in european rasm. the decrease in international capacity was driven by a 9.5 percent, 2.4 percent and 1.8 percent reduction in pacific, european and latin american asms, respectively. the company's regional affiliates include two wholly owned subsidiaries, american eagle airlines, inc. and executive airlines, inc. collectively, amr eagle , and two independent carriers, trans states airlines, inc. trans states and chautauqua airlines, inc. chautauqua . in 2002, american had a fee per block hour agreement with chautauqua, and prorate agreements with amr eagle and trans states. in 2003, american had fee per block hour agreements with all three carriers. regional affiliates' traffic increased 18.0 percent while capacity increased 20.1 percent, to approximately 2.1 billion asms. certain amounts from 2002 related to regional affiliates have been reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation. the company's operating expenses decreased 17.1 percent, or 872 million. wages, salaries and benefits decreased 12.1 percent, or 257 million, primarily due to the modified labor agreements and management reductions discussed in note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. commissions, booking fees and credit card expense decreased 16.4 percent, or 51 million, due primarily to the benefit from the changes in the commission structure implemented in march 2002 and a 4.6 percent decrease in passenger revenues. maintenance, materials and repairs decreased 34.4 percent, or 98 million, due primarily to a decrease in airframe and engine volumes at the company's maintenance bases resulting from a variety of factors including the retirement of aircraft, the timing of sending engines to repair vendors and a decrease in the number of flights reduced aircraft utilization and the receipt of certain vendor credits. the company expects maintenance, materials and repairs costs to increase as aircraft utilization increases and the benefit from retiring aircraft subsides. aircraft rentals decreased 37 million, or 17.3 percent, due primarily to concessionary agreements with certain lessors and the removal of leased aircraft from service in prior periods. food service decreased 16.1 percent, or 29 million, due primarily to reductions in the level of food service. other operating expenses decreased 15.4 percent, or 107 million, due to decreases in contract maintenance work that american performs for other airlines, and decreases in travel and incidental costs, advertising and promotion costs, insurance, and data processing expenses. special charges for the second quarter of 2003 include i a 20 million aircraft related credit to finalize prior accruals, ii 49 million in facility exit costs and iii 47 million in employee charges. see note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding special charges. u.s. government grant includes a 358 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement of security service fees from the u.s. government under the act. 15 18 other income expense , historically a net expense, increased 43 million due to the following interest income decreased 55.6 percent, or 10 million, due primarily to decreasing short term investment balances and decreases in interest rates. interest expense increased 26 million, or 15.9 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in the company's long term debt. the company has experienced significant cumulative losses and as a result generated certain net operating losses available to offset future taxes payable. as a result of the cumulative operating losses, a valuation allowance was established against the full amount of the company's net deferred tax asset as of december 31, 2002. the company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. during 2003, the company continued to record a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which results in no tax benefit being recorded for the pretax losses and the charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from the minimum pension liability adjustment discussed in note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. the company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased 150 million in the second quarter of 2003, to 903 million as of june 30, 2003. the effective tax rate for the three months ended june 30, 2002 was impacted by a 30 million charge resulting from a provision in congress' economic stimulus package that changed the period for carrybacks of net operating losses nols . this change allowed the company to carry back 2001 and 2002 nols for five years, rather than two years under the previous law, allowing the company to more quickly recover its nols. the extended nol carryback did however result in the displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years. these credits are now expected to expire before being utilized by the company, resulting in this charge. operating statistics

7.11 per share, as compared to a net loss of 2.1 billion, or 13.27 per share for the same period in 2002. the company's 2003 results include 358 million in security cost reimbursements received under the act see note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information . the company's 2002 results include a one time, non cash charge to record the cumulative effect of a

goodwill and other intangible assets see note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements . amr's operating loss of 782 million decreased 548 million compared to the same period in 2002. the company's 2003 revenues continued to decrease year over year. the company's revenues through april continued to be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown, the war in iraq and the outbreak of sars. these trends however, began to reverse in may and june. overall, the company's revenues decreased approximately 227 million, or 2.6 percent, to 8.4 billion in 2003 from the same period in 2002. american's passenger revenues decreased by 4.1 percent, or 293 million, in 2003 from the same period in 2002. american's domestic revenue per available seat mile rasm for the six months ended june 30, however, increased 0.4 percent, to 8.62 cents, on a capacity decrease of 5.9 percent, to 57.7 billion available seat miles asms . international rasm decreased to 8.50 cents, or 1.9 percent, on a capacity increase of 1.7 percent. the decrease in international rasm was due to a 22.8 percent and 0.8 percent decrease in pacific and latin american rasm slightly offset by a 1.4 percent increase in european rasm. the increase in international capacity was driven by a 16.9 percent and 3.0 percent increase in pacific and european asms, respectively, slightly offset by a 1.7 percent reduction in latin american asms. in 2002, american had a fixed fee per block hour agreement with chautauqua, and prorate agreements with amr eagle and trans states. in 2003, american had fixed fee per block hour agreements with all three carriers. regional affiliates' traffic increased 16.1 percent in 2003 while capacity increased 17.5 percent, to approximately 4.1 billion asms. certain amounts from 2002 related to regional affiliates have been reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation. 17 20 other revenues increased 11.4 percent, or 53 million, due primarily to increases in ticket change fees coupled with changes to the company's change fee arrangements with travel agencies, increases in airfreight service fees due primarily to fuel surcharges and increases in aadvantage fees. the company's operating expenses decreased 7.7 percent, or 775 million. wages, salaries and benefits decreased 5.7 percent, or 239 million, primarily due to the modified labor agreements and management reductions discussed in note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. aircraft fuel expense increased 16.3 percent, or 193 million, due primarily to a 23.8 percent increase in american's average price per gallon of fuel. commissions, booking fees and credit card expense decreased 18.4 percent, or 116 million, due primarily to the benefit from the changes in the commission structure implemented in march 2002 and a 3.5 percent decrease in passenger revenues. maintenance, materials and repairs decreased 24.1 percent, or 133 million, due primarily to a decrease in airframe and engine volumes at the company's maintenance bases resulting from a variety of factors including the retirement of aircraft, the timing of sending engines to repair vendors and a decrease in the number of flights reduced aircraft utilization and the receipt of certain vendor credits. the company expects maintenance, materials and repairs costs to increase as aircraft utilization increases and the benefit from retiring aircraft subsides. aircraft rentals decreased 73 million, or 16.6 percent, due primarily to concessionary agreements with certain lessors and the removal of leased aircraft from

a 20 million aircraft related credit to finalize prior accruals, ii 49 million in facility exit costs and iii 72 million in employee charges. see note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding special charges. u.s. government grant includes a 358 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement of security service fees from the u.s. government under the act. other income expense , historically a net expense, increased 83 million due to the following interest income decreased 41.7 percent, or 15 million, due primarily to decreasing short term investment balances and a decrease in interest rates. interest expense increased 52 million, or 15.8 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in the company's long term debt. miscellaneous net decreased 9 million, due to the write down of certain investments held by the company during the first quarter of 2003. the company has experienced significant cumulative losses and as a result generated certain net operating losses available to offset future taxes payable. as a result of the cumulative operating losses, a valuation allowance was established against the full amount of the

and chautauqua, whereas 2002 operating expenses include expenses incurred related to fee per block hour agreements with regional affiliate chautauqua. liquidity and capital resources in february 2003, american asked its labor leaders and other employees for approximately 1.8 billion in annual savings through a combination of changes in wages, benefits and work rules. the requested 1.8 billion in savings was divided by work group as follows 660 million pilots 620 million transportation workers union represented employees 340 million flight attendants 100 million management and support staff and 80 million agents and representatives. references in this document to american's three major unions include the allied pilots association the apa the transportation workers union the twu and the association of professional flight attendants the apfa . on march 31, 2003, american announced that it had reached agreements with its three major unions the labor agreements . it also reported various changes in the pay plans and benefits for non unionized personnel including officers and other management the management reductions . the anticipated cost savings arising from the labor agreements and the management reductions met the targeted annual savings of 1.8 billion. on april 24, 2003 and april 25, 2003, the three major unions certified the ratification of the labor agreements with some modifications the modified labor agreements . the principal modifications were a shorter duration and the ability to initiate the process of re negotiating the modified labor agreements after three years. even with these modifications, the modified labor agreements continue to meet the targeted annual savings. 19 22 of the approximately 1.8 billion in estimated annual savings, approximately 1.0 billion relate to wage and benefit reductions while the remaining approximately .8 billion is expected to be accomplished through changes in work rules, which will result in additional job reductions. as a result of these additional job reductions, the company incurred 60 million in severance charges in the second quarter of 2003 see note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information . wage reductions became effective on april 1, 2003 for officers and may 1, 2003 for all other employees. reductions related to benefits and work rule changes will be phased in over time. the company expects total savings from wages, benefits and work rule changes to be 400 million in the third quarter of 2003 and 450 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. in connection with the changes in wages, benefits and work rules, the company granted approximately 38 million shares of amr stock to american's employees in the form of stock options which will vest over a three year period with an exercise price of 5 per share see note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information . in addition, subsequent to the ratification of the modified labor agreements, the company and american reached concessionary agreements with certain vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers collectively, the vendors, and the agreements, the vendor agreements . generally, under the terms of these vendor agreements the company or american will receive the benefit of lower rates and charges for certain goods and services, and more favorable rent and financing terms with respect to certain of its aircraft. in return for these concessions, the company anticipates that it will issue over time up to 3.0 million shares of amr's common stock to vendors. as of june 30, 2003, approximately 2.2 million shares have been issued to vendors. as of june 30, 2003, the annual cost savings from the vendors are estimated to be nearly 200 million. the company's revenue environment has improved during the second quarter of 2003 as reflected in improved unit revenues revenue per available seat mile in may and june 2003. even with this improvement however, the company's revenues are still depressed relative to historical levels and the company's recent losses have adversely affected its financial condition. the company therefore needs to see continued improvement in the revenue environment to return it to sustained profitability at acceptable levels. to maintain sufficient liquidity as the company implements its plan to return to sustained profitability, the company will need continued access to additional funding, most likely through a combination of financings and asset sales. in addition, the company's ability to return to sustained profitability will depend on a number of risk factors, many of which are largely beyond the company's control. among other things, the following factors have had and or may have a negative impact on the company's business and financial results the uncertain financial and business environment the company faces, the struggling economy, high fuel prices and the availability of fuel, the residual effects of the war in iraq, conflicts in the middle east, the residual effects of the sars outbreak, historically low fare levels, the competitive environment, uncertainties with respect to the company's international operations, changes in its business strategy, actions by u.s. or foreign government agencies, the possible occurrence of additional terrorist attacks, or the inability of the company to satisfy existing liquidity requirements or other covenants in certain of its credit arrangements. in particular, if the revenue environment deteriorates beyond normal seasonal trends, or the company is unable to access the capital markets or sell assets, it may be unable to fund its obligations and sustain its operations. during 2001 and 2002, the company raised approximately 8.3 billion of funding to finance capital commitments and to fund operating losses. the company expects that it will need continued access to the capital markets until such time as the company returns to sustained profitability. the company had approximately 1.8 billion in unrestricted cash and short term investments as of june 30, 2003. the company also had available possible future financing sources, including, but not limited to i a limited amount of additional secured aircraft debt after giving effect to the july 2003 enhanced equipment trust certificates transaction described below, virtually all of the company's section 1110 eligible aircraft are encumbered , ii sale leaseback transactions of owned property, including aircraft and real estate, iii securitization of future operating receipts, iv unsecured debt, v equity and vi the potential sale of certain non core assets including the company's interests in amr investments . however, the availability and level of these financing sources cannot be assured, particularly in light of the fact that the company has fewer unencumbered assets available than it had in the past. to the extent that the company's revenues deteriorate and it is unable to access capital markets and raise additional capital, the company may be unable to fund its obligations and sustain its operations. 20 23 in july 2003, american issued 255 million of enhanced equipment trust certificates, secured by aircraft, which bear interest at 3.86 percent and are repayable in semi annual installments beginning in 2004, with a final maturity in 2010. these obligations are insured by a third party. the company has a significant amount of indebtedness which could have important consequences, such as i limiting the company's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general purposes, ii requiring the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness, iii making the company more vulnerable to economic downturns, limiting its ability to withstand competitive pressures and reducing its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, and iv limiting the company's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates. amr and american's credit ratings are significantly below investment grade. in february 2003, moody's downgraded the senior implied rating for amr, the senior unsecured ratings of both amr and american and the ratings of most of american's secured debt. also in february 2003, standard poor's lowered its long term corporate credit ratings for both amr and american, lowered the senior secured and unsecured debt ratings of amr, and lowered the secured debt rating of american. american's short term rating was withdrawn. ratings on most of american's non enhanced equipment trust certificates were also lowered. in march 2003, standard poor's further lowered its long term corporate credit ratings for both amr and american, lowered the senior secured and unsecured debt ratings of amr, and lowered the secured debt rating of american. ratings on most of american's non enhanced equipment trust certificates were also lowered. these previous reductions have increased the company's borrowing costs. on june 9, 2003, moody's affirmed the ratings of amr and american, removed the ratings from review for possible downgrade, and gave the ratings a negative outlook. on june 20, 2003, standard poor's raised its ratings of amr and american and removed the ratings from creditwatch. additional significant reductions in amr's or american's credit ratings would further increase its borrowing or other costs and further restrict the availability of future financing. in march 2003, standard poor's removed amr's common stock from the s p 500 index. american has a fully drawn 834 million credit facility that expires december 15, 2005. on march 31, 2003, american and certain lenders in such facility entered into a waiver and amendment that i waived, until may 15, 2003, the requirement that american pledge additional collateral to the extent the value of the existing collateral was insufficient under the terms of the facility, ii waived american's liquidity covenant for the quarter ended march 31, 2003, iii modified the financial covenants applicable to subsequent periods, and iv increased the applicable margin for advances under the facility. on may 15, 2003, american pledged an additional 30 non section 1110 eligible aircraft having an aggregate net book value as of april 30, 2003 of approximately 450 million. pursuant to the modified financial covenants, american is required to maintain at least 1.0 billion of liquidity, consisting of unencumbered cash and short term investments, for the second quarter 2003 and beyond. while the company was in compliance with the covenant at june 30, 2003, if the company is adversely affected by the risk factors discussed in note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements or elsewhere in this report, it is uncertain whether the company will be able to satisfy this liquidity requirement through the expiration of the facility at the end of 2005. failure to do so or obtain a waiver of this requirement would result in a default under this facility and would likely trigger defaults under a significant number of other debt arrangements. in addition, the required ratio of ebitdar to fixed charges under the facility has been decreased until the period ending december 31, 2004, and the next test of such cash flow coverage ratio will not occur until march 31, 2004. the amendment also provided for a 50 basis point increase in the applicable margin over london interbank offered rate libor , which resulted in an effective interest rate as of june 30, 2003 of 4.73 percent. the interest rate will be reset again on september 17, 2003. at american's option, interest on the facility can be calculated on one of several different bases. for most borrowings, american would anticipate choosing a floating rate based upon libor. 21 24 in april 2003, the president signed the act, which includes aviation related assistance provisions. the act authorized payment of i 100 million to compensate air carriers for the direct costs associated with the strengthening of flight deck doors and locks and ii 2.3 billion to reimburse air carriers for increased security costs which was distributed in proportion to the amounts each carrier had paid or collected in passenger security and air carrier security fees to the transportation security administration as of the act's enactment the security fee reimbursement . in addition, the act suspends the collection of the passenger security fee from june 1, 2003 until october 1, 2003 and authorizes the extension of war risk insurance through august 31, 2004 and permits further extensions until december 31, 2004 . the act also limits the total cash compensation for the two most highly compensated named executive officers in 2002 for certain airlines, including the company, during the period april 1, 2003 to april 1, 2004 to the amount of salary received by such officers, or their successors, in 2002. a violation of this executive compensation provision would require the carrier to repay the government for the amount of the security fee reimbursement. the company does not anticipate any difficulties in complying with this limitation on executive compensation and believes the likelihood of repaying the government for the amount of the security fee reimbursement is remote. the company's security fee reimbursement was 358 million net of payments to independent regional affiliates and was recorded as a reduction to operating expenses during the second quarter of 2003. the company's compensation for the direct costs associated with strengthening flight deck doors will be recorded as a reduction to capitalized flight equipment as such amounts are received. the company has restricted cash and short term investments related to projected workers' compensation obligations and various other obligations of 550 million as of june 30, 2003. in the first quarter of 2003, the company redeemed 339 million of tax exempt bonds that were backed by standby letters of credit secured by restricted cash and short term investments resulting in a reduction in restricted cash and short term investments. of the 339 million of tax exempt bonds that were redeemed, 253 million were accounted for as operating leases. payments to redeem these tax exempt special facility revenue bonds are generally considered prepaid facility rentals and will reduce future operating lease commitments. the remaining 86 million of tax exempt bonds that were redeemed were accounted for as debt and had original maturities in 2014 through 2024. as of june 30, 2003 the company has approximately 221 million in fuel prepayments and credit card holdback deposits classified as other current assets and other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. as discussed in note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, the company reached concessionary agreements with certain lessors. the vendor agreements with these lessors affected the payments, lease term, and other conditions of certain leases. as a result of these changes to the payment and lease terms, 30 leases which were previously accounted for as operating leases were converted to capital leases, and one lease which was previously accounted for as a capital lease was converted to an operating lease. the remaining leases did not change from their original classification. the company recorded the new capital leases at the fair value of the respective assets being leased. these changes did not have a significant effect on the company's condensed consolidated balance sheet. in addition, certain of the concessionary agreements provide that the company's obligations under the related lease revert to the original terms if certain events occur prior to december 31, 2005, including i an event of default under the related lease which generally occurs only if a payment default occurs , ii an event of loss with respect to the related aircraft, iii rejection by the company of the lease under the provisions of chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code or iv the company's filing for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code. if any one of these events were to occur, the company would be responsible for approximately 11 million in additional lease payments as of june 30, 2003. this amount will increase to 230 million prior to the expiration of the provision on december 31, 2005. such amounts are being treated as contingent rentals and will only be recognized if they become due. 22 25 as part of the vendor agreements discussed in note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, american entered into an agreement to transfer 33 fokker 100 aircraft with minimal net book value as of june 30, 2003 to a lender in the third quarter of 2003. in return, the lender has agreed to restructure approximately 130 million in debt related to certain of these aircraft. in addition, american will provide shares of amr common stock to the lender as discussed in note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. however, the restructured debt agreement contains certain provisions that would require american to repay certain amounts of the original debt if certain events occur prior to december 31, 2005, including i an event of default which generally occurs only if a payment default occurs , ii an event of loss with respect to the related aircraft, iii rejection by the company of the lease under the provisions of chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code or iv the company's filing for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code. the company expects to recognize a significant gain as a result of this restructuring, with the majority of the gain recognized in the third quarter of 2003, and the remainder recognized on december 31, 2005, if none of the above events have occurred. net cash provided by operating activities in the six month period ended june 30, 2003 was 384 million, an increase of 339 million over the same period in 2002. included in net cash provided by operating activities the first six months of 2003 was the receipt of a 572 million federal tax refund and the receipt of 358 million from the government under the act. included in net provided by operating activities for the first six months of 2002 was approximately 658 million received by the company as a result of the utilization of its 2001 nols. capital expenditures for the first six months of 2003 were 847 million, and included the acquisition of seven boeing 767 300ers, two boeing 777 200 ers, ten embraer 140s and four bombardier crj 700 aircraft. these capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and debt agreements. during the six month period ended june 30, 2003, american and amr eagle borrowed approximately 641 million under various debt agreements which are secured by aircraft and other property. these agreements have effective interest rates which are fixed or variable based on libor plus a spread and mature over various periods of time through 2019. as of june 30, 2003, the effective interest rate on these agreements ranged up to 8.81 percent. in june 2003, the company sold its interest in worldspan, a computer reservations company, for 180 million in cash and a 39 million promissory note, resulting in a gain of 17 million which is included in other income loss in the consolidated statement of operations. as of june 30, 2003, the company had commitments to acquire the following aircraft two boeing 767 300ers, 12 embraer regional jets and seven bombardier crj 700s in 2003 an aggregate of 74 embraer regional jets and six bombardier crj 700s in 2004 through 2006 and an aggregate of 47 boeing 737 800s and nine boeing 777 200ers in 2006 through 2010. future payments for all aircraft, including the estimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate 407 million during the remainder of 2003, 755 million in 2004, 711 million in 2005 and an aggregate of approximately 2.6 billion in 2006 through 2010. boeing capital corporation has agreed to provide backstop financing for all boeing aircraft deliveries in 2003. in return, american has granted boeing a security interest in certain advance payments previously made and in certain rights under the aircraft purchase agreement between american and boeing. in addition, the company has pre arranged financing or backstop financing for all of its 2003 embraer and bombardier aircraft deliveries and a portion of its post 2003 deliveries. special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities primarily to purchase equipment and improve airport facilities that are leased by american and accounted for as operating leases. approximately 2.1 billion of these bonds with total future payments of approximately 5.2 billion as of june 30, 2003 are guaranteed by american, amr, or both. these guarantees can only be invoked in the event american defaults on the lease obligation and certain other remedies are not available. approximately 740 million of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender provisions that require american to repurchase the bonds at various times through 2008, including 198 million in november 2003. although american has the right to remarket the bonds there can be no assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. any payments to redeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would generally be considered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future operating lease commitments. 23 26 the following table summarizes the company's obligations and commitments as of june 30, 2003, to be paid in 2003 through 2007 in millions nature of commitment 2003 6

certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities which are supported by operating leases executed by american are guaranteed by amr and american. 2 substantially all of the 2003 commitment is supported by committed financing. 3 includes expected payments based on projected volumes rather than minimum required payments. 4 excludes related interest amounts. 5 includes noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services, primarily information technology support. other commitments for the remainder of 2003 are not significant. 6 amounts are as of june 30, 2003. in addition to the commitments summarized above, the company is required to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans. these contributions are required under the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement pension plan income security act erisa . the company's 2003 minimum required pension contributions are approximately 186 million and the company's estimated 2004 minimum required pension contributions are 600 million. due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions, such as pension plan benefit levels, interest rate levels and the amount and timing of asset returns, the company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of future required contributions beyond 2004. however, based on the current regulatory environment and market conditions, the company expects its 2005 minimum required pension contributions to significantly exceed its 2004 minimum required pension contributions. other information a provision in the scope clause of american's prior contract with the allied pilots associations apa limited the number of available seat miles asms and block hours that could be flown under american's marketing code aa by american's regional carrier partners when american pilots are on furlough the so called asm cap . to ensure that american remained in compliance with the asm cap, american and american eagle took several steps in 2002 to reduce the number of asms flown by american's wholly owned commuter air carriers. as one of those measures, amr eagle signed a letter of intent to sell executive airlines, its san juan based subsidiary. another provision in the prior apa contract limited to 67 the total number of regional jets with more than 44 seats that could be flown under the aa code by american's regional carrier partners. as amr eagle continued to accept previously ordered bombardier and embraer regional jets this cap would have been reached in early 2003. to ensure that american remained in compliance with the 67 aircraft cap, amr eagle reached an agreement to dispose of 14 embraer erj 145 aircraft from its fleet. trans states airlines, an americanconnection carrier, agreed to acquire these aircraft. under the prior contract between aa and the apa, trans states would have had to operate these aircraft under its ax code, rather than the aa code, at its st. louis hub. 24 27 the labor agreement with the apa one of the modified labor agreements , ratified in april 2003, modified the provisions in the apa contract described in the immediately preceding two paragraphs to give the company more flexibility with its american eagle operations. the limitations on the use of regional jets were substantially reduced and are now tied to 110 percent of the size of american's narrowbody aircraft fleet. as a consequence of these modifications, it is no longer necessary to use trans states' ax marketing code on flights operated by trans states as the americanconnection, and amr eagle has discontinued its plans to sell executive airlines. in addition, amr eagle has revised its agreement to dispose of 14 embraer erj 145 aircraft to include ten rather than 14 aircraft. the company carries insurance for public liability, passenger liability, property damage and all risk coverage for damage to its aircraft. as a result of the september 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers have significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events war risk coverage . at the same time, they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general. the u.s. government has provided commercial war risk insurance for u.s. based airlines until august 12, 2003 covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. the company believes this insurance coverage will be extended beyond august 12, 2003 because the act provides for the insurance to remain in place until august 31, 2004, and the department of transportation has stated its intent to do so. in addition, the secretary of transportation may extend the policy until december 31, 2004, at his discretion. however, there is no guarantee that it will be extended. in the event the commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount of insurance coverage available to the company or significantly increase the cost of aviation insurance, or if the government fails to renew the war risk insurance that it provides, the company's operations and or financial position and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. forward
