PART II — RULES 12b-25(b) AND (c)
If the subject report could not be filed without
unreasonable effort or expense and the registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12b-25(b),
the following should be completed. (Check box if appropriate)






 (a)


The reason described in reasonable detail in
  Part III of this form could not be eliminated without unreasonable
  effort or expense




x


 (b)


The subject annual report, semi-annual report,
  transition report on Form 10-K, Form 20-F, Form 11-K,
  Form N-SAR or Form N-CSR, or portion thereof, will be filed
  on or before the fifteenth calendar day following the prescribed due date; or

  subject distribution report on Form 10-D, or portion thereof, will

  date; and




 


 (c)

PART III — NARRATIVE
State below in reasonable detail why Forms 10-K,
20-F, 11-K, 10-Q, 10-D, N-SAR, N-CSR, or
the transition report or portion thereof, could not be filed within the
prescribed time period.
The Form 10-Q could not be timely filed as our
registered certified public accountant requested additional time to complete
its FIN 48 tax analysis.  The Company
adopted Financial Standards Accounting Board Interpretation No. 48 Accounting

result in any further changes to our first quarter results as described herein.
