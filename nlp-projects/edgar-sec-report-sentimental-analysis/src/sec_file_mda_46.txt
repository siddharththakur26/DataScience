to the foregoing. the words believe , expect , anticipate , estimate , project and similar expressions identify forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made.

statements, describe factors, among others, that could contribute to or cause such differences, or that could affect amerco's stock price. general information on fiscal year and industry segments is incorporated by reference to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes 1, 20 and 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements . the notes discuss the principles of consolidation,

and 180.6 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. details by material segment follows moving and storage operations cash provided by operating activities was 147.5 million, 128.5 million and 109.8 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the increase from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2000 is partially due to an increase in net income. the increase from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 1999 is also partially due to increased net income. real estate operations cash provided by operating activities was 24.8 million, 38.0 million and 92.5 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the decrease in fiscal year 2000, is due to a decrease in the intercompany payable. in fiscal year 1999, proceeds received from the sale of real estate was used to pay down the intercompany payable. property and casualty cash provided used by operating activities was 11.1 million, 21.7 million and 23.8 million for the years ended december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. the 1999 to 1998 change resulted mainly from the increased funds withheld liability, decreased paid losses recoverable and a smaller decrease in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. this was offset by increased premiums and agent's balances and the intercompany receivable due from affiliates. the 1998 to 1997 change resulted mainly from an increase in paid losses recoverable and the change in loss and loss expense reserves partially offset by increased net income and decreased accounts receivable. republic's cash and cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio were 6.0 million, 6.1 million and 16.3 million at december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. this balance reflects funds in transition from maturity proceeds to long term investments. this level of liquid assets, combined with budgeted cash flow, is adequate to meet periodic needs. capital and operating budgets allow republic to schedule cash needs in accordance with investment and underwriting proceeds. 14 life insurance cash provided by operating activities was 22.2 million, 34.6 million and 8.2 million for the years ended december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. the decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 1999 relates to paid loss experience. the increase in cash flows from operating activities in 1998 relates to the increased premium production in the credit insurance and medicare supplement areas. oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts from interest sensitive products and investment income. the primary uses of cash are operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders. matching the investment portfolio to the cash flow demands of the types of insurance being written is an important consideration. benefit and claim statistics are continually monitored to provide projections of future cash requirements. in addition to cash flows from operating and financing activities, a substantial amount of liquid funds is available through oxford's short term portfolio. short term investments aggregated 30.7 million, 63.4 million and 13.4 million at december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. management believes that the overall sources of liquidity will continue to meet foreseeable cash needs. consolidated group to meet the needs of its customers, u haul must maintain a large inventory of fixed asset rental items. at march 31, 2000, net property, plant and equipment represented approximately 66.6 of total assets from non insurance operations and approximately 44.2 of consolidated assets. in fiscal year 2000, gross capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were 417.6 million, as compared to 298.5 million and 392.3 million in fiscal years 1999 and 1998, respectively. these expenditures primarily reflect the replacement of certain rental trucks and trailers. the capital needs required to fund these acquisitions were funded with internally generated funds from operations and lease financings. during each of the fiscal years ending march 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, u haul estimates gross capital expenditures will average approximately 325 million primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation. this level of capital expenditures, combined with a potential range of 30 115 million in annual long term debt maturities, are expected to create annual average funding needs of approximately 355 440 million. management estimates that u haul will fund 100 of these requirements with leases and internally generated funds, including proceeds from the disposition of older trucks and other asset sales. moving and storage operations u haul's stockholder's equity was 435.4 million, 384.7 million and 342.9 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the increase in fiscal year 2000 was due to earnings. the increase in fiscal year 1999 was due to earnings and to the sale of property to a related party recorded in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity. the increase in fiscal year 1998 was due to increased earnings. real estate operations real estate stockholder's equity was 95.6 million, 79.5 million and 45.5 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the increase in fiscal year 2000 was due to earnings. the increase in fiscal year 1999 was due to earnings and to the sale of property to a related party recorded in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity. the increase in fiscal year 1998 was due to increased earnings. 15 property and casualty republic maintains a diversified securities investment portfolio, primarily in bonds at varying maturity levels with 88.0 of the fixed income securities consisting of investment grade securities. the maturity distribution is designed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future cash needs. current liquidity remains strong, with current invested assets equal to 92.9 of total liabilities. the liability for reported and unreported losses are based upon both republic's historical and industry averages. unpaid loss adjustment expenses are based on historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid. unpaid loss and loss expenses are not discounted. republic's stockholder's equity was 208.5 million, 211.4 million and 195.4 million at december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. republic considers current stockholder's equity to be adequate to support future growth and absorb unforeseen risk events. republic does not use debt or equity issues to increase capital and therefore has no exposure to capital market conditions. life insurance oxford's stockholder's equity was 88.1 million, 93.6 million and 85.8 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. oxford did not pay dividends to its parent during 1999, 1998 or 1997. applicable laws and regulations of the state of arizona require republic and oxford to maintain minimum capital determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. such amount is 1.0 million and 0.4 million, for republic and oxford, respectively. in addition, the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders by insurance companies domiciled in the state of arizona is limited. any dividend in excess of the limit requires prior regulatory approval. statutory surplus which can be distributed as dividends without regulatory approval at december 31, 1999 is 16.1 million and 1.4 million for republic and oxford, respectively at december 31, 1999. these restrictions are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the company to meet its cash obligations. oxford issued a surplus note to amerco on december 31, 1998 for 10.0 million. approval by the arizona department of insurance is required prior to payment of principal and interest. credit agreements amerco's operations are funded by various credit and financing arrangements, including unsecured long term borrowings, unsecured medium term notes and revolving lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks. to finance its fleet of trucks and trailers, u haul routinely enters into sale and leaseback transactions. as of march 31, 2000, amerco had 1,137.8 million in total notes and loans outstanding and unutilized committed lines of credit of approximately 241.0 million. certain of amerco's credit agreements contain restrictive financial and other covenants, including, among others, covenants with respect to incurring additional indebtedness, issuing mandatory repayment preferred stock, maintaining certain financial ratios and placing certain additional liens on its properties and assets. at march 31, 2000, amerco was in compliance with these covenants. reference is made to note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. results of operations consolidated rental revenue rental revenue, net of commission expense was 1,150.5 million, 1,074.2 million and 1,018.7 million in fiscal years

and 1998, respectively. the increase from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2000 was primarily due to the growth in truck rental revenues which benefited from transactional growth and reflects a higher average revenue per transaction. the increase from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 1999 also reflects a growth in truck rental revenues benefiting from transactional growth reflecting increased utilization. 16 real estate operations rental revenue, before intercompany eliminations, were 73.4 million, 74.0 million and 69.9 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. intercompany rental revenue was 71.0 million, 71.9 million and 67.4 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the decrease from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2000 was 0.6 million. rental revenue was consistent between fiscal year 1999 and fiscal year 2000. the increase from 1998 to 1999 reflects the addition of new system operating companies. net sales net sales revenues were 188.8 million, 181.3 million and 176.2 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. revenue growth from the sale of moving support items i.e. boxes, etc. and propane resulted in the

1997, respectively. the 1999 premium increase resulted from assumed treaty reinsurance which increased to 80.7 million, 51.2 million and 49.1 million in the years ended december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. republic underwrites professional reinsurance via broker markets and premiums in this area increased due to the agricultural reinsurance business. direct multiple peril and general agency premium increased to 25.0 million and 17.8 million in 1999 compared to 21.0 million and 6.5 million in 1998, and 16.5 million and 5.8 million in 1997, respectively. this increase was reduced by rental industry earnings, which decreased to 50.3 million in 1999 from 66.6 million in 1998 and 84.5 million in 1997, respectively. this decrease results from the restructuring of the u haul business auto general liability policy. the deductible was changed at april 1, 1999 from a flat deductible to a 95 deductible. this reduced premium by 19.6 million in 1999 as compared to 1998. this resulted in a savings of 0.6 million in premium taxes for policy year 1999. life insurance premium revenues, before intercompany eliminations, were 96.4 million, 94.5 million and 29.7 million for the years ended december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. during 1999, oxford realized premium increases from 1998 and 1997 in the areas of medicare supplement, credit life and disability, and single premium whole life insurance products. oxford increased medicare supplement premium through the reinsurance of a block of policies and by adding direct premium from the acquisition of nai in 1997, increasing premiums by 6.7 million from 1998 and 35.4 million from 1997. oxford's single premium whole life product accounts for an additional 2.9 million of premiums in 1999 over 1998 and 5.5 million over 1997. in the area of credit insurance, oxford increased direct writings as well as reduced the amount ceded to outside reinsurers. these factors contributed to a 3.5 million increase in premium from 1998 and 28.4 million from 1997. as expected, premium decreases resulted from the termination of non essential nai lines, fewer annuitizations and from the sale of nafcic. these changes accounted for an 11.2 million decrease in premiums in 1999 from 1998 and 2.6 million decrease from 1997. net investment and interest income net investment and interest income was 82.0 million, 72.4 million and 65.7

years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the increase during fiscal year 2000 in interest reflects higher average note receivable balances. real estate operations net investment and interest income was 7.0 million, 4.5 million and 0.6 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the increase in fiscal year 2000 is due to interest income received on notes receivable. the increase in

the years ended december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. the decrease in 1999 from 1998 is attributable to a decrease in invested assets and a lower yield on reinvested funds. the increase in 1998 over 1997 resulted from enhanced yield provided by an increased investment in preferred stock. life insurance net investment income was 21.3 million, 19.1 million and 17.8 million for the years ended december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. the increase is due to improved interest rate spreads on the retirement savings products. this improvement was realized as a result of better returns on the investment portfolio. operating expenses operating expenses were 918.8 million, 876.6 million and 818.6 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. details by material

million for 1998 and 1997 respectively. all other underwriting expenses consisted of 13.9 million, 15.5 million and 8.2 million for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. life insurance operating

and losses benefits and losses were 209.6 million, 176.6 million and 175.6 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. details by material segment follow property and casualty benefits and losses incurred were 150.5 million, 118.9 million and 165.9 million for the years ended december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. the increase from 1998 to 1999 resulted from the increase in assumed treaty reinsurance claims. the decrease from 1997 to 1998 is due mainly to the reduction in insurance transactions with u haul. this corresponds to the decrease in the liabilities for unpaid claims and estimated future losses for current and prior policies for those transactions. 18 life insurance benefits incurred were 59.1 million, 57.7 million and 24.4 million for the years ended december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. this increase is primarily due to medicare supplement, which accounts for 4.4 million of benefit increase from 1998 and 27.0 million from 1997. however, in relation to premium, the percentage of medicare supplement benefits dropped by two percentage points in 1999 from 1998. increases in policyholder reserves for the new whole life product increased

acquired nai. details by material segment follow property and casualty the amortization of dac for december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was 13.4 million, 7.4 million and 8.6 million, respectively. the increase from 1998 to 1999 is due mainly to nafcic related dac expense following republic's purchase of nafcic from oxford in december 1998, which increased to 3.8 million from 0.2 million in 1998. also contributing was a 1.9 million increase in the nonaffiliated agents' expense. field underwriting expenses increased due to an increase in 1998 written and unearned premiums. excess worker's compensation program increased due to 1998 commission expenses relating to a settlement agreement with the previous general agent. the decrease from 1997 to 1998 is due to the assumed reinsurance dac

1997, respectively. oxford defers commissions and other policy acquisition costs on single premium business. these costs are amortized as the premium is earned over the term of the policy. oxford continues to increase its single premium credit business in force, thus increasing both the deferred costs on the balance sheet and the subsequent amortization. after oxford purchased nai in 1997, oxford began amortizing the voba asset recognized at purchase. in 1999, oxford did not have dac amortization charges related to nafcic that were present in 1998 1998 amortization was 3.0 million. the

fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the increase in fiscal year 2000 reflects an increase in depreciation expense on the rental truck fleet. the decrease in fiscal year 1999 reflects an increase in the gains from the disposition of property, plant and equipment. during fiscal year 1999, based on an in depth market analysis, the estimated salvage value and useful lives of certain rental equipment was increased. the effect of the change decreased depreciation expense by 11.1 million in fiscal year 1998. the adjustment reflects management's best estimate, based on information currently available, of the estimated salvage value and useful lives of this rental equipment. real estate operations depreciation expense, net before intercompany elimination was 9.3 million, 12.0 million and 6.4 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the decrease in fiscal year 2000 reflects an increase in gains from the disposition of property, plant and equipment and a

estate operations earnings from operations before intercompany elimination were 64.0 million, 60.3 million and 58.1 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. a decrease in intercompany management fees charged contributed to the earnings increase for fiscal year 2000 compared to the prior two fiscal years. property and casualty earnings from operations were 7.9 million, 19.1 million and 0.7 million for the years ended december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. the 1998 to 1999 decrease resulted mainly from republic's writing off the 1995 american bonding receivable, lower than forecasted premium volume in 1999 and higher than expected losses on the agricultural business. the 1997 to 1998 increase is due to decreased underwriting expenses and increased realized gains. life insurance earnings from operations were 14.2 million, 12.2 million and 10.6 million for the years ended december 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. the increase over prior

expense was 81.5 million, 73.7 million and 79.4 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the increase can be attributed to an increase in the average cost of debt in fiscal year 2000 over the past two fiscal years. the average debt level outstanding increased in fiscal year 2000 compared to fiscal year 1999, and decreased in fiscal year 1999 compared to fiscal year 1998. 20
