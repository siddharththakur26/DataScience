NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

We are a multi-faceted oilfield service company that provides services and equipment to oil and
natural gas exploration and production companies, domestically in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico,
Colorado, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, and internationally
in Mexico. We operate in five sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry: directional
drilling services; rental tools; casing and tubing services; compressed air drilling services; and
production services.

We derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and
equipment required to provide a service. The price we charge for our services depends upon several
factors, including the level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive
environment in the particular geographic regions in which we operate. Contracts are awarded based
on price, quality of service and equipment and general reputation and experience of our personnel.
The principal operating costs are direct and indirect labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance
of our equipment, insurance, equipment rentals, fuel, depreciation and general and administrative
expenses.

Basis of Presentation

Our unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
Accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. We
believe that the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate to make the information not
misleading. The unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the interim
periods. These unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2005. The results of operations for the interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year.

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year’s consolidated condensed financial
statements to conform with the current period presentation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty.
Accordingly, our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. While management believes
that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements
are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but are
not limited to, determining the following: allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of
long-lived assets and intangibles, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes
and valuation allowances. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional
information is obtained and as our operating environment changes.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. SFAS No. 154
requires retroactive application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period
financial statements unless it is impracticable. SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in
method of depreciation, amortization or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted
for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS
No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 154 as of January 1, 2006 and the
adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs – an Amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4, which amends the guidance in ARB No. 43 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts
of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. SFAS No. 151 requires that
these items be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires the
allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. We adopted the provisions of SFAS 151, on a prospective basis, as of
January 1, 2006 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R revises
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and focuses on accounting for share-based
payments for services by employer to employee. This statement requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements
based on their grant-date fair values. See Note 3 for a more detailed description of our adoption
of SFAS No. 123R.

NOTE 2 — ACQUISITIONS

Effective January 1, 2006, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Specialty Rental Tools,
Inc., or Specialty, for $83.6 million in cash. The results of Specialty’s operations have been
included in the consolidated financial statements since that date. Specialty, located in
Lafayette, Louisiana, is engaged in the rental of high quality drill pipe, heavy weight spiral
drill pipe, tubing work strings, blow-out preventors, choke manifolds and various valves and
handling tools for oil and natural gas drilling. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Specialty
had revenues of $29.6 million. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase
price to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of
acquisition:

On September 1, 2005, we acquired the casing and tubing service assets of Patterson Services, Inc.
for approximately $15.6 million. These assets are located in Corpus Christi, Texas; Kilgore,
Texas; Lafayette, Louisiana and Houma, Louisiana.

Effective August 1, 2005, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Target Energy Inc.,
or Target, for $1.3 million in cash and forgiveness of a lease receivable of approximately $0.6
million. The purchase price was allocated to the fixed assets of Target. The results of Target are
included in our directional and horizontal drilling segment as their measurement while drilling, or
MWD, equipment is utilized in that segment.

On July 11, 2005, we acquired the compressed air drilling assets of W.T. Enterprises, Inc., or WT,
based in South Texas, for $6.0 million in cash. The equipment includes compressors, boosters, mist
pumps and vehicles. Goodwill of $82,000 and other identifiable intangible assets of $1.5 million
were recorded in connection with the acquisition.

On July 11, 2005, we acquired from M-I its 45% interest in AirComp L.L.C., or AirComp, and a
subordinated note in the principal amount of $4.8 million issued by AirComp, for which we paid M-I
$7.1 million in cash and issued to M-I a $4.0 million subordinated note bearing interest at 5% per
annum. As a result, we now own 100% of AirComp.

On May 1, 2005, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Capcoil Tubing Services, Inc.,
or Capcoil, for $2.7 million in cash, 168,161 shares of our common stock and the payment or
assumption of approximately $1.3 million of debt. Capcoil, located in Kilgore, Texas, is engaged

NOTE 3 – STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

We adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. Compensation cost for awards
granted prior to, but not vested, as of January 1, 2006 would be based on the grant date attributes
originally used to value those awards for pro forma purposes under SFAS No. 123. We adopted SFAS
No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option
pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. Under the
modified prospective method, we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of
December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the
remaining vesting periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. We
estimated forfeiture rates for the first quarter of 2006 based on our historical experience.

The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free rate
of interest is the related U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods within the expected term of the
option at the time of grant. The dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero as we
have historically not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future. The
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock.

Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock-based compensation using Accounting Principle
Board Opinion No. 25. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is recognized for stock options with
an exercise price that is less than the market price on the grant date of the option. For stock
options with exercise prices at or above the market value of the stock on the grant date, we
adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation.
We also adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123 for the stock options granted to our
employees and directors. Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized under APB No. 25.

NOTE 4 – INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

We compute income per common share in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per
Share. SFAS No. 128 requires companies with complex capital structures to present basic and diluted
earnings per share. Basic earnings per share are computed on the basis of the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is
similar to basic earnings per share, but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of
potential common shares (e.g., convertible preferred stock, stock options, etc.) as if they had
been converted. Potential dilutive common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (e.g., those
that increase income per share) are excluded from diluted earnings per share.

The components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows (in thousands, except per
share amounts):

NOTE 5 – GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets are not permitted to be amortized. Goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets remain on the balance sheet and are tested for impairment on an
annual basis, or when there is reason to suspect that their values may have been diminished or
impaired. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets listed on the balance sheet totaled $12.4
million at March 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Based on impairment testing performed during 2005
pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 142, these assets were not impaired.

Intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives.
Definite-lived intangible assets that continue to be amortized under SFAS No. 142 relate to our
purchase of customer-related and marketing-related intangibles. These intangibles have useful
lives ranging from five to ten years. Amortization of intangible assets for the three months ended
March 31, 2006 and 2005 were $384,000 and $166,000, respectively. At March 31, 2006, intangible
assets totaled $6.4 million, net of $3.1 million of accumulated amortization.

NOTE 6 — RESTATEMENT

We understated diluted earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted shares
outstanding for the third quarter of 2003, for each of the first three quarters of 2004, for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 and for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. In addition, we
understated basic earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted average basic
shares outstanding for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. Consequently, we have restated our
financial statements for each of those periods. The incorrect calculation resulted from a
mathematical error and an improper application of SFAS No. 128. The effect of the restatement is
to reduce weighted average diluted shares outstanding for each period and to reduce weighted
average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. Consequently, weighted
average diluted earnings per share were increased for each period and weighted average basic
earnings per share was increased for the quarter ended September 30, 2004.

A restated earnings per share calculation for the three months ended March 31, 2005 reflecting the
above adjustments to our results as previously presented is presented below. The amounts are in
thousands, except for per share amounts.

Senior notes, bank loans and line of credit agreements

On January 18, 2006, we closed on a private offering, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, of $160.0 million aggregate principal amount of our
senior notes. The notes are due January 15, 2014 and bear interest at 9.0%. The proceeds were
used to fund the acquisition of Specialty, to repay existing debt and for general corporate
purposes.

Prior to January 18, 2006, we were party to a July 2005 credit agreement that provided for the
following senior secured credit facilities:




 
•
 
A $13.0 million revolving line of credit. Borrowings were limited to 85% of eligible
accounts receivable plus 50% of eligible inventory (up to a maximum of $2.0 million of
borrowings based on inventory). This line of credit was to be used to finance working
capital requirements and other general corporate purposes, including the issuance of
standby letters of credit. Outstanding borrowings under this line of credit were $6.4
million at a margin above prime and LIBOR rates plus margin averaging approximately 8.1% as
of December 31, 2005.


 

 
•
 
Two term loans totaling $42.0 million. Outstanding borrowings under these term loans
were $42.0 million as of December 31, 2005. These loans were at LIBOR rates plus a margin
which averages approximately 7.8% at December 31, 2005.



Borrowings under the July 2005 credit facilities were to mature in July 2007. Amounts outstanding
under the term loans as of July 2006 were to be repaid in monthly principal payments based on a 48
month repayment schedule with the remaining balance due at maturity. Additionally, during the
second year, we were to be required to prepay the remaining balance of the term loans by 75% of
excess cash flow, if any, after debt service and capital expenditures. The interest rate payable
on borrowings was based on a margin over the London Interbank Offered Rate, referred to as LIBOR,
or the prime rate, and there was a 0.5% fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving line of credit.
The margin over LIBOR was to increase by 1.0% in the second year.

NOTE 8 – DEBT (Continued)

All amounts outstanding under our July 2005 credit agreement were paid off with the proceeds of our
senior notes offering on January 18, 2006. On January 18, 2006, we also executed an amended and
restated credit agreement which provides for a $25.0 million revolving line of credit with a
maturity of January 2010. Our January 2006 amended and restated credit agreement contains
customary events of default and financial covenants and limits our ability to incur additional
indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay dividends or make other distributions, create liens
and sell assets. Our obligations under the January 2006 amended and restated credit agreement are
secured by substantially all of our assets.

Notes payable and real estate loan

On July 11, 2005, we acquired from M-I its 45% equity interest in AirComp and the subordinated note
in the principal amount of $4.8 million issued by AirComp, for which we paid M-I $7.1 million in
cash and issued a new $4.0 million subordinated note bearing interest at 5% per annum. The
subordinated note issued to M-I requires quarterly interest payments and the principal amount is
due October 9, 2007. Contingent upon a future equity offering, the subordinated note is
convertible into up to 700,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to the market
value of the common stock at the time of conversion.

As of December 31, 2005, Allis-Chalmers Tubular Services Inc., or Tubular, had a subordinated note
outstanding and payable to Jens Mortensen, the seller of Tubular and one of our directors, in the
amount of $4.0 million with a fixed interest rate of 7.5%. Interest was payable quarterly and the
final maturity of the note was January 31, 2006. The subordinated note was subordinated to the
rights of our bank lenders. The balance of this subordinated note was repaid in full in January
2006 with proceeds from our senior notes offering.

As part of the acquisition of Mountain Compressed Air Inc., or Mountain Air, in 2001, we issued a
note to the sellers of Mountain Air in the original amount of $2.2 million accruing interest at a
rate of 5.75% per annum. The note was reduced to $1.5 million as a result of the settlement of a
legal action against the sellers in 2003. In March 2005, we reached an agreement with the sellers
and holders of the note as a result of an action brought against us by the sellers. Under the
terms of the agreement, we paid the holders of the note $1.0 million in cash, and agreed to pay an
additional $350,000 on June 1, 2006, and an additional $150,000 on June 1, 2007, in settlement of
all claims. At March 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 the outstanding amounts due were $500,000.

In connection with the purchase of Delta, we issued to the sellers a note in the amount of
$350,000. The note bears interest at 2% and the principal and accrued interest was repaid on its
maturity of April 1, 2006.

In connection with the purchase of Tubular, we agreed to pay a total of $1.2 million to Mr.
Mortensen in exchange for a non-compete agreement. Monthly payments of $20,576 are due under this
agreement through January 31, 2007. In connection with the purchase of Safco-Oil Field Products,
Inc., or Safco,, we also agreed to pay a total of $150,000 to the sellers in exchange for a
non-compete agreement. We are required to make annual payments of $50,000 through September 30,
2007. In connection with the purchase of Capcoil, we agreed to pay a total of $500,000 to two
management employees in exchange for non-compete agreements. We are required to make annual
payments of $110,000 through May 2008. Total amounts due under non-compete agreements at March 31,
2006 and December 31, 2005 were $615,000 and $698,000, respectively.

In 2000 we compensated directors, including current directors Nederlander and Toboroff, who served
on the board of directors from 1989 to March 31, 1999 without compensation, by issuing promissory
notes totaling $325,000. The notes bear interest at the rate of 5.0%. At March 31, 2006 and
December 31, 2005, the principal and accrued interest on these notes totaled approximately $96,000.

We also had a real estate loan which was payable in equal monthly installments of $4,344 with the
remaining outstanding balance due on January 1, 2010. The loan has a floating interest rate based
on prime plus 2.0%. The outstanding principal balance was $548,000 at December 31, 2005. The
balance of this loan was repaid in full in January 2006 with proceeds from our senior notes
offering.

for equipment financing loans were $2.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively. We also have
various capital leases with terms that expire in 2008. As of March 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
amounts outstanding under capital leases were $796,000 and $917,000, respectively. In January 2006,
we prepaid $350,000 of the outstanding equipment loans with proceeds from our senior notes
offering.

NOTE 9 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

We also had options and warrants exercised in the first quarter of 2006, those exercises resulted
in 365,342 shares of our common stock being issued for approximately $972,000. We recognized
$942,000 of compensation expense related to stock options in the first quarter of 2006 that was
recorded as additional paid in capital (see Note 3).

NOTE

ALLIS-CHALMERS ENERGY INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 11 — LEGAL MATTERS

We are named from time to time in legal proceedings related to our activities prior to our
bankruptcy in 1988. However, we believe that we were discharged from liability for all such claims
in the bankruptcy and believe the likelihood of a material loss relating to any such legal
proceeding is remote.

On December 31, 2004, Mountain Air was a defendant in an action brought in April 2004 in the
District Court of Mesa County, Colorado, by the former owner of Mountain Air Drilling Service
Company, Inc., from whom Mountain Air acquired assets in 2001. The plaintiff sought to accelerate
payment of the note issued in connection with the acquisition and sought $1.9 million in damages
(representing principal and interest due under the note), on the basis that Mountain Air failed to
provide financial statements required by the note. We raised several defenses to the plaintiff’s
claim. In March 2005, we reached an agreement with the plaintiff to settle the action and paid to
the plaintiff $1.0 million on April 1, 2005 and agreed to pay an additional $350,000 on June 1,
2006, and $150,000 on June 1, 2007, in settlement of all amounts due under the promissory note and
all other claims.

We are also involved in various other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The
legal proceedings are at different stages; however, we believe that the likelihood of material loss
relating to any such legal proceeding is remote.

NOTE 12 — SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On April 4, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Rogers Oil Tool Services, Inc., or Rogers, based
in Lafayette, Louisiana, for a total consideration of approximately $13.7 million, which includes
$11.3 million in cash, $1.6 million in our common stock and a $750,000 three-year promissory note.
In addition, we purchased all the patents and proprietary technology that Tommie L. Rogers, Rogers’
founder and Chief Executive Officer, developed at Rogers. Rogers provides service for tubing tongs
and casing tongs and by renting and selling specialized automated power tongs to the snubbing and
well control markets. Rogers also rents and sells drill pipe tongs, accessories, hydraulic power
units and hydraulic tong positioners.

In April 2006, we entered into a stock purchase agreement for the acquisition of all of the
outstanding capital stock of DLS Drilling, Logistics & Services Corporation. We anticipate that
the purchase price will consist of $102.3 million in cash and 2.5 million shares of our common
stock. The stock purchase agreement provides that if we are unable to obtain the necessary
financing by August 15, 2006, we must pay to the sellers a cash
break-up fee equal to $1.0 million. DLS currently operates a fleet of 51 rigs, including 20
drilling rigs, 18 workover rigs and 12 pulling rigs in Argentina and
one drilling rig in Bolivia.

In May of 2006, we filed a registration statement for an offering of common stock in the amount of
$80.0 million to fund a portion of the cash purchase price of DLS.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION

This document contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual
results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements.
Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the general condition of
the oil and natural gas drilling industry, demand for our oil and natural gas service and rental
products, and competition. Other factors are identified in our SEC filings, including our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 under the heading “Risk Factors” located
at the end of “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected historical
financial data and our accompanying financial statements and the notes to those financial
statements included elsewhere in this document. The following discussion contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that reflect
our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including,
but not limited to, those discussed above.

Overview of Our Business

We are a multi-faceted oilfield services company that provides services and equipment to oil and
natural gas exploration and production companies, domestically in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico,
Colorado, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and internationally
in Mexico. We currently operate in five sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry:
directional drilling services; rental tools; casing and tubing services; compressed air drilling
services; and production services.

We derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and
equipment required to provide a service. The price we charge for our services depends upon several
factors, including the level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive
environment in the particular geographic regions in which we operate. Contracts are awarded based
on price, quality of service and equipment, and general reputation and experience of our personnel.
The demand for drilling services has historically been volatile and is affected by the capital
expenditures of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which can fluctuate based
upon the prices of oil and natural gas, or the expectation for the prices of oil and natural gas.

The number of working drilling rigs, typically referred to as the “rig count,” is an important
indicator of activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry. The rig count in the U.S.
increased from 862 as of December 31, 2002 to 1,608 on April 30, 2006 according to the Baker Hughes
rig count. Furthermore, directional and horizontal rig counts increased from 283 as of December
31, 2002 to 656 on April 30, 2006, which accounted for 32.8% and 40.8% of the total U.S. rig count,
respectively. Currently, we believe that the number of available drillings rigs is insufficient to
meet the demand for drilling rigs. Consequently, unless a significant number of additional
drilling rigs are brought online, the rig count may not increase substantially despite the strong
demand.

Our cost of revenues represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and
maintenance of our equipment. The principal elements of these costs are direct and indirect labor
and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment, insurance, equipment rentals, fuel and
depreciation. Operating expenses do not fluctuate in direct proportion to changes in revenues
because, among other factors, we have a fixed base of inventory of equipment and facilities to
support our operations, and in periods of low drilling activity we may also seek to preserve labor
continuity to market our services and maintain our equipment.

Restatement

We understated diluted earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted shares
outstanding for the third quarter of 2003, for each of the first three quarters of 2004, for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 and for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. In addition, we
understated basic earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted average basic
shares outstanding for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. Consequently, we have restated our
financial statements for each of those periods. The incorrect calculation resulted from a
mathematical error and an improper application of SFAS No. 128. The effect of the restatement is
to reduce weighted average diluted shares outstanding for each period and to reduce weighted
average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. Therefore, diluted
earnings per share were increased for each period and basic earnings per share were increased for
the quarter ended September 30, 2004. Based on the proper allocation of SFAS No. 128, for the
three months ended March 31, 2005, weighted average diluted shares outstanding was 14,695,000,
compared to the previously reported weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 17,789,000 for
the three months ended March 31, 2005. The effect is to increase diluted earnings per share to
$0.11 for the three months ended March 31, 2005 compared to the $0.09 previously reported for the
period (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements).

Comparison of Three Months Ended March 31, 2006 and 2005

Our revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2006 were $47.0 million, an increase of 143.2%
compared to $19.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005. Revenues increased in all of
our business segments due to acquisitions completed in the second and third quarters of 2005 and
the first quarter of 2006, improved pricing for our services, the addition of operations and sales
personnel, the opening of new operations offices and the purchase of additional equipment.
Revenues increased most significantly at our rental tools segment due to the acquisition of
Specialty Rental Tools, Inc., or Specialty, effective January 1, 2006 and Delta Rental Services
Inc., or Delta, on April 1, 2005, and at the compressed air drilling segment due to the acquisition
of the air drilling assets of W.T. Enterprises, Inc., or WT, on July 11, 2005, and improved pricing
for our services in West Texas. Our directional drilling services segment revenues increased in
the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period due to improved pricing for directional drilling
services, the acquisition of Target Energy, Inc., or Target, which provides
measurement-while-drilling tools, or MWD, the addition of operations and sales personnel, the
opening of new operations offices and the purchase of additional down-hole motors which increased
our capacity and market presence.

Revenues also increased at our casing and tubing services segment due the acquisition of the casing
and tubing assets of Patterson Services, Inc on September 1, 2005, along with improved market
conditions and increased market penetration for our services in South Texas, East Texas, Louisiana
and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Also contributing to increased revenues was the acquisition of
Capcoil Tubing Services, Inc., or Capcoil, as of May 1, 2005 in our production services segment.

Our gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 increased 195.8% to $16.7 million, or 35.4%
of revenues, compared to $5.6 million, or 29.1%, of revenues for the three months ended March 31,
2005. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is due to the acquisition of
Specialty as of January 1, 2006 and the acquisition of Delta as of April 1, 2005, in the high
margin rental tool business. The increase in gross profit is also due to increased revenues at our
compressed air drilling services segment, including the acquisition of the air drilling assets of
WT, increased revenues and improved pricing in the directional drilling services segment, improved
market conditions for our domestic casing and tubing segment and the acquisition of additional
casing and tubing assets in September 2005. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by
an increase in depreciation expense of 264.3% to $3.3 million for the first quarter of 2006
compared to $0.9 million for the first quarter of 2005. The increase is due to additional
depreciable assets resulting from the acquisitions and capital expenditures. Our cost of revenues
consists principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of
our equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. Because many of our costs are fixed, our gross
profit as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues.

General and administrative expense was $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2006 period compared to
$3.0 million for the first quarter of 2005. General and administrative expense increased due to
the additional expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the hiring of additional sales and
administrative personnel. General and administrative expense also increased because of increased
accounting and consulting fees and other expenses in connection with initiatives to strengthen our
internal control processes, costs related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance efforts and increased
corporate accounting and administrative staff. As a percentage of revenues, general and
administrative expenses were 13.8% in the 2006 quarter and 15.5% in the 2005 quarter.

Table of Contents

We adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. With the adoption of SFAS no.
123R, we recorded $0.9 million of expense related to stock options during the three months ended
March 31, 2006. We adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method,
utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our
employee stock options. Under the modified prospective method, we record compensation cost related
to unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair
value of these awards over the remaining vesting periods of those awards with no change in
historical reported earnings. Therefore, we recorded an expense of $0.9 million related to stock
options for the three months ended March 31, 2006. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for our
stock-based compensation using Accounting Principle Board Opinion No. 25. Under APB No. 25,
compensation expense is recognized for stock options with an exercise price that is less than the
market price on the grant date of the option. Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized
under APB No. 25.

Amortization expense was $607,000 in the first quarter of 2006 compared to $394,000 in the first
quarter of 2005. The increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of intangible
assets in connection with our acquisitions and the amortization of deferred financing costs.

Income from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2006 totaled $8.6 million, a 284.2%
increase over income from operations of $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005,
reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross profit, offset in part by increased general and
administrative expenses, stock option expense and amortization.

Our net interest expense was $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $521,000 for
the first quarter of 2005. Interest expense increased in the 2006 quarter due to the increased
borrowings at a higher average interest rate. In January of 2006 we issued $160.0 million of senior notes
bearing interest at 9.0% to fund the acquisition of Specialty, pay off other outstanding debt and
for working capital.

Minority interest in income of subsidiaries for the first quarter of 2006 was $0 compared to
$144,000 for the first quarter of 2005 due to the acquisition of the minority interest in AirComp
L.L.C., or AirComp, as of July 11, 2005.

We had net income of $4.4 million for the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 182.3%, compared to
net income of $1.6 million for the first quarter of 2005.

The following table compares revenues and income from operations for each of our business segments.
Income (loss) from operations consists of revenues less cost of revenues, general and
administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization:

Directional Drilling Services Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 for our directional drilling services segment were
$15.1 million, an increase of 52.0% from the $9.9 million in revenues for the quarter ended March
31, 2005. Income from operations increased 38.7% to $2.6 million for the first quarter of 2006
from $1.9 million for the comparable 2005 period. The improved results for this segment are due to
the increase in drilling activity in the Texas and Gulf Coast areas, improved pricing for
directional and horizontal drilling services, the acquisition of Target as of August 1, 2005, the
establishment of new operations in West Texas and Oklahoma, and the addition of operations and
sales personnel which increased our capacity and market presence. Our increased operating expenses
as a result of the addition of operations and personnel were more than offset by the growth in
revenues and improved pricing for our services.

Rental Tools Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 for the rental tools segment were $10.4 million, from
$373,000 in revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Income from operations increased to
$5.0 million in the 2006 period compared to loss from operations of $80,000 in the 2005 period.
Our rental tools revenues and operating income for the first quarter of 2006 increased compared to
the prior year due primarily due to the acquisitions of Specialty and Delta. The acquisition of
Specialty increased the rental tool revenue by $8.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
Delta was acquired as of April 1, 2005, and Specialty was acquired as of January 1, 2006, the
effective date of their respective acquisitions. Safco-Oil Field Products, Inc., or Safco, Delta
and Specialty were merged in February 2006 to form Allis-Chalmers Rental Tools, Inc

Casing and Tubing Services Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 for the casing and tubing services segment were $9.5
million, an increase of 165.7% from the $3.6 million in revenues for the quarter ended March 31,
2005. Revenues from domestic operations increased to $8.0 million in the 2006 period from $1.9
million in the 2005 period as a result of the acquisition of the casing and tubing assets of
Patterson Services on September 1, 2005, which resulted in increased market penetration for our
services in South Texas, East Texas, Louisiana and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Revenues from Mexico
operations decreased to $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2006 from $1.7 million in the 2005
period. Income from operations increased 39.5% to $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2006 from
$1.3 million in the first quarter of 2005. The increase in this segment’s operating income is due
to our increased revenues from domestic operations. The operating income as a percentage of
revenue decreased to 19.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2006 compared to 37.3% for the same
period of 2005. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues is due to the
increase in domestic revenues as compared to Mexico revenues, which have higher operating income
margins.

Compressed Air Drilling Services Segment

Our compressed air drilling revenues were $9.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006,
an increase of 117.6% compared to $4.2 million in revenues for the three months ended March 31,
2005. Income from operations increased to $2.2 million in the 2006 period compared to income from
operations of $527,000 in the 2005 period. Our compressed air drilling revenues and operating
income for the first quarter of 2006 increased compared to the prior year due primarily due to the
acquisition of the air drilling assets of WT as of July 11, 2005, improved pricing for our services
and our investment in additional equipment.

Production Services Segment

Operations for this segment consist of Downhole Injection Services, LLC, or Downhole which was
acquired December 1, 2004, and Capcoil which was acquired May 1, 2005. Downhole and Capcoil were
merged in February 2006, to form Allis-Chalmers Production Services, Inc. Revenues were $3.0
million for the three months ended March 31, 2006, an increase of 127.1% compared to $1.3 million
in revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2005. Income from operations increased to
$277,000 in the 2006 period compared to loss from operations of $39,000 in the 2005 period. Our
production services revenues and operating income for the first quarter of 2006 increased compared
to the prior year due primarily due to the acquisition of Capcoil.

General Corporate

General corporate expenses increased $1.9 million to $3.3 million for the three months ended March
31, 2006 compared to $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005. The increase was due
to stock option expense of $0.9 million recorded in 2006 with the adoption of SFAS 123R, the
increase in accounting and administrative staff to support the growing organization, increased
franchise taxes based on our increased authorized shares and cost related to our Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance effort.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our on-going capital requirements arise primarily from our need to service our debt, to complete
acquisitions and acquire and maintain equipment, and to fund our working capital requirements. Our
primary sources of liquidity are borrowings under our revolving lines of credit, proceeds from the
issuance of debt and equity securities and cash flows from operations. We had cash and cash
equivalents of $10.7 million at March 31, 2006 compared to $1.9 million at December 31, 2005.

Operating Activities

In the three months ended March 31, 2006, our operating activities used $5.6 million in cash
compared to a use of $822,000 for the same period in 2005. Net income for the three months ended
March 31, 2006 increased to $4.4 million, compared to $1.6 million in the 2005 period. The $4.4
million in net income for the 2006 period includes a charge of $0.9 million related to the
expensing of stock options as required under SFAS No. 123R. Revenues and income from operations
increased in the first three months of 2006 due to acquisitions completed in the first quarter of
2006 and the second and third quarters of 2005, the investment in additional equipment, the opening
of new operations offices and the addition of operations and sales personnel. Non-cash expenses
totaled $4.9 million during the first three months of 2006 consisting of $3.9 million of
depreciation and amortization, $0.9 million from the expensing of stock options, $355,000 of
imputed interest related to the effective date of the Specialty acquisition, $180,000 related to
increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivables, offset by $514,000 on the gain from
asset retirements. Non-cash expenses during the first three months of 2005 totaled $1.5 million,
consisting of depreciation and amortization expense of $1.3 million and minority interest of
$144,000.

During the three months ended March 31, 2006, changes in operating assets and liabilities used
$14.9 million in cash, principally due to an increase of $4.3 million in accounts receivable, an
increase of $1.5 million in inventory, a decrease of $1.3 million in accounts payable, and a
decrease of $11.0 million in an accrued expense, offset in part by an increase of $2.8 million in
accrued interest. Accounts receivable increased due to the increase in our revenues in the first
three months of 2006. Other inventory increased primarily due to increased activity levels. The
decrease in accrued expenses can be attributed to accrued bonuses of Specialty that we paid in
connection with the acquisition. The increase in accrued interest relates to our 9.0% senior
notes.

During the three months ended March 31, 2005, changes in operating assets and liabilities used $3.8
million in cash, principally due to an increase of $3.4 million in accounts receivable, an increase
of $515,000 in inventory and other assets, and a decrease of $92,000 in accrued expenses, offset in
part by an increase in accrued salaries, benefits and payroll taxes of $185,000. Accounts
receivable increased by $3.4 million at March 31, 2005 due to the increase in our revenues in the
first quarter of 2005. Other assets increased due primarily to an increase in prepaid insurance
related to insurance premium deposits required for our policies that went into affect April 1,
2005.

Investing Activities

During the three months ended March 31, 2006, we used $89.8 million in investing activities,
consisting of $83.4 million for the acquisition of Specialty, net of cash received and $7.6 million
for capital expenditures, offset by $1.2 million of proceeds from equipment sales. Included in the
$7.6 million for capital expenditures was $2.6 million for the expansion of our MWD equipment used
in the directional drilling segment and $2.2 million for additional equipment in our compressed air
drilling services segment. A majority of our equipment sales relate to items “lost in hole” by our
customers. During the first three months of 2005, we used $2.7 million in investing activities,
consisting principally of the purchase of equipment of $1.6 million for casing equipment,
approximately $263,000 for the purchase of downhole motors and approximately $779,000 for new
compressed air drilling equipment.

Financing Activities

During the three months ended March 31, 2006, financing activities provided $104.1 million in cash.
We received $161.4 million in proceeds from long-term debt, repaid $43.5 million in borrowings
under long-term debt facilities, repaid $3.0 million in related party debt, repaid $6.4 million
under our line of credit and paid $5.3 in debt issuance costs. We also received $972,000 in
proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants. On January 18, 2006, we closed on a private
offering of $160.0 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes. The notes are due
January 15, 2014 and bear interest at 9.0%. The proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to
fund the Specialty acquisition, to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes. During
the three months ended March 31, 2005, financing activities provided a net of $2.2 million in cash.
We received $2.4 million, net, in borrowings under long-term debt facilities and paid $178,000 in
debt issuance costs.

Table of Contents

Prior to January 18, 2006, we were party to a July 2005 credit agreement that provided for the
following senior secured credit facilities:




 
•
 
A $13.0 million revolving line of credit. Borrowings were limited to 85% of eligible
accounts receivable plus 50% of eligible inventory (up to a maximum of $2.0 million of
borrowings based on inventory). This line of credit was to be used to finance working
capital requirements and other general corporate purposes, including the issuance of
standby letters of credit. Outstanding borrowings under this line of credit were $6.4
million at a margin above prime and LIBOR rates plus margin averaging approximately 8.1% as
of December 31, 2005.


 

 
•
 
Two term loans totaling $42.0 million. Outstanding borrowings under these term loans
were $42.0 million as of December 31, 2005. These loans were at LIBOR rates plus a margin
which averages approximately 7.8% at December 31, 2005.



Borrowings under the July 2005 credit facilities were to mature in July 2007. Amounts outstanding
under the term loans as of July 2006 were to be repaid in monthly principal payments based on a 48
month repayment schedule with the remaining balance due at maturity. Additionally, during the
second year, we were to be required to prepay the remaining balance of the term loans by 75% of
excess cash flow, if any, after debt service and capital expenditures. The interest rate payable
on borrowings was based on a margin over the London Interbank Offered Rate, referred to as LIBOR,
or the prime rate, and there was a 0.5% fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving line of credit.
The margin over LIBOR was to increase by 1.0% in the second year.

All amounts outstanding under our July 2005 credit agreement were paid off with the proceeds of our
senior notes offering on January 18, 2006. On January 18, 2006, we also executed an amended and
restated credit agreement which provides for a $25.0 million revolving line of credit with a
maturity of January 2010. Our January 2006 amended and restated credit agreement contains
customary events of default and financial covenants and limits our ability to incur additional
indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay dividends or make other distributions, create liens
and sell assets. Our obligations under the January 2006 amended and restated credit agreement are
secured by substantially all of our assets.

At March 31, 2006, we had $169.1 million in outstanding indebtedness, of which $166.0 million was
long term debt and $3.1 million was the current portion of long term debt.

On July 11, 2005, we acquired from M-I its 45% equity interest in AirComp and the subordinated note
in the principal amount of $4.8 million issued by AirComp, for which we paid M-I $7.1 million in
cash and issued a new $4.0 million subordinated note bearing interest at 5% per annum. The
subordinated note issued to M-I requires quarterly interest payments and the principal amount is
due October 9, 2007. Contingent upon a future equity offering, the subordinated note is
convertible into up to 700,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to the market
value of the common stock at the time of conversion.

As of December 31, 2005, Allis-Chalmers Tubular Services Inc., or Tubular, had a subordinated note
outstanding and payable to Jens Mortensen, the seller of Tubular and one of our directors, in the
amount of $4.0 million with a fixed interest rate of 7.5%. Interest was payable quarterly and the
final maturity of the note was January 31, 2006. The subordinated note was subordinated to the
rights of our bank lenders. The balance of this subordinated note was repaid in full in January
2006 with proceeds from our senior notes offering.

As part of the acquisition of Mountain Compressed Air Inc., or Mountain Air, in 2001, we issued a
note to the sellers of Mountain Air in the original amount of $2.2 million accruing interest at a
rate of 5.75% per annum. The note was reduced to $1.5 million as a result of the settlement of a
legal action against the sellers in 2003. In March 2005, we reached an agreement with the sellers
and holders of the note as a result of an action brought against us by the sellers. Under the
terms of the agreement, we paid the holders of the note $1.0 million in cash, and agreed to pay an
additional $350,000 on June 1, 2006, and an additional $150,000 on June 1, 2007, in settlement of
all claims. At March 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 the outstanding amounts due were $500,000.

In connection with the purchase of Delta, we issued to the sellers a note in the amount of
$350,000. The note bears interest at 2% and the principal and accrued interest was repaid on its
maturity of April 1, 2006.

Table of Contents

In connection with the purchase of Tubular, we agreed to pay a total of $1.2 million to Mr.
Mortensen in exchange for a non-compete agreement. Monthly payments of $20,576 are due under this
agreement through January 31, 2007. In connection with the purchase of Safco, we also agreed to
pay a total of $150,000 to the sellers in exchange for a non-compete agreement. We are required to
make annual payments of $50,000 through September 30, 2007. In connection with the purchase of
Capcoil, we agreed to pay a total of $500,000 to two management employees in exchange for
non-compete agreements. We are required to make annual payments of $110,000 through May 2008.
Total amounts due under non-compete agreements at March 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 were
$615,000 and $698,000, respectively.

In 2000 we compensated directors, including current directors Nederlander and Toboroff, who served
on the board of directors from 1989 to March 31, 1999 without compensation, by issuing promissory
notes totaling $325,000. The notes bear interest at the rate of 5.0%. At March 31, 2006 and
December 31, 2005, the principal and accrued interest on these notes totaled approximately $96,000.

We also had a real estate loan which was payable in equal monthly installments of $4,344 with the
remaining outstanding balance due on January 1, 2010. The loan has a floating interest rate based
on prime plus 2.0%. The outstanding principal balance was $548,000 at December 31, 2005. The
balance of this loan was repaid in full in January 2006 with proceeds from our senior notes
offering.

We have various equipment financing loans with interest rates ranging from 5% to 8.2% and terms
ranging from 2 to 5 years. As of March 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the outstanding balances
for equipment financing loans were $2.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively. We also have
various capital leases with terms that expire in 2008. As of March 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
amounts outstanding under capital leases were $796,000 and $917,000, respectively. In January 2006,
we prepaid $350,000 of the outstanding equipment loans with proceeds from our senior notes
offering.

We have no off balance sheet arrangements, other than normal operating leases and employee
contracts, that have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources. We do not guarantee obligations of any unconsolidated
entities.

Capital Requirements

We have identified capital expenditure projects that will require up to approximately $10.0 million
for the remainder of 2006, exclusive of any acquisitions. We believe that our current cash
generated from operations, cash available under our credit facilities and cash on hand will provide
sufficient funds for our identified projects.

We intend to implement a growth strategy of increasing the scope of services through both internal
growth and acquisitions. We are regularly involved in discussions with a number of potential
acquisition candidates. The acquisition of assets could require additional financing, which we
currently anticipate would be borrowed under our bank facility. Any such borrowing would require
the consent of our lenders under our bank credit facilities. We also expect to make capital
expenditures to acquire and to maintain our existing equipment. Our performance and cash flow from
operations will be determined by the demand for our services which in turn are affected by our
customers’ expenditures for oil and gas exploration and development, and industry perceptions and
expectations of future oil and natural gas prices in the areas where we operate. We will need to
refinance our existing debt facilities as they become due and provide funds for capital
expenditures and acquisitions. To effect our expansion plans, we will require additional equity or
debt financing and the proceeds of the pending offering. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in raising the additional debt or equity capital or that we can do so on terms that will
be acceptable to us.

Recent Developments

On April 4, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Rogers Oil Tool Services, Inc., or Rogers, based
in Lafayette, Louisiana, for a total consideration of approximately $13.7 million, which includes
$11.3 million in cash, $1.6 million in our common stock and a $750,000 three-year promissory note.
In addition, we purchased all the patents and proprietary technology that Tommie L. Rogers, Rogers’
founder and Chief Executive Officer, developed at Rogers. Rogers provides service for tubing tongs
and casing tongs and by renting and selling specialized automated power tongs to the snubbing and
well control markets. Rogers also rents and sells drill pipe tongs, accessories, hydraulic power
units and hydraulic tong positioners.

In April 2006, we entered into a stock purchase agreement for the acquisition of all of the
outstanding capital stock of DLS Drilling, Logistics & Services Corporation. We anticipate that
the purchase price will consist of $102.3 million in cash and 2.5 million shares of our common
stock. The stock purchase agreement provides that if we are unable to obtain the necessary
financing by August 15, 2006, we must pay to the sellers a cash
break-up fee equal to $1.0 million. DLS currently operates a fleet of 51 rigs, including 20
drilling rigs, 18 workover rigs and 12 pulling rigs in Argentina and
one drilling rig in Bolivia.

In May of 2006, we filed a registration statement for an offering of common stock in the amount of
$80.0 million to fund a portion of the cash purchase price of DLS.

Critical Accounting Policies

Please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 for a description of
other policies that are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of
operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business
operations is discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. No
material changes to such information have occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2006.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. SFAS No. 154
requires retroactive application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period
financial statements unless it is impracticable. SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in
method of depreciation, amortization or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted
for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS
No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statement’. SFAS No. 154 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 154 as of January 1, 2006 and the
adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R revises SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and focuses on accounting for share-based
payments for services by employer to employee. The statement requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements
based on their fair values. We adopted SFAS No. 123R as of January 1, 2006 and used the modified
prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the calculation
of the fair value of our employee stock options. Under the modified prospective method, stock
option awards that are granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2006 will be measured and
accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. Compensation cost for awards granted prior to, but
not vested, as of January 1, 2006 would be based on the grant date attributes originally used to
value those awards for pro forma purposes under SFAS No. 123. See Note 3 of our unaudited
consolidated condensed financial statements for a more detailed description of our adoption of SFAS
No. 123R.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs – an Amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4, which amends the guidance in ARB No. 43 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts
of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. SFAS No. 151 requires that
these items be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires the
allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 151, on a prospective basis, as of
January 1, 2006 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency
exchange risks.

Interest Rate Risk.

Fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable
rate debt obligations expose us to market risk. We are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in
interest rates affecting our adjustable rate debt, and any future refinancing of our fixed rate
debt and our future debt.

At December 31, 2005, we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations on approximately $49.0 million
of notes payable and bank credit facility borrowings carrying variable interest rates. During the
three months ended March 31, 2006, we repaid all variable interest rate debt.

We have also been subject to interest rate market risk for short-term invested cash and cash
equivalents. The principal of such invested funds would not be subject to fluctuating value
because of their highly liquid short-term nature. As of March 31, 2006, we had $9.3 million
invested in short-term investments.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.

We conduct business in Mexico through our Mexican partner, Matyep. This business exposes us to
foreign exchange risk. To control this risk, we provide for payment in U.S. dollars. However, we
have historically provided our partner a discount upon payment equal to 50% of any loss suffered by
our partner as a result of devaluation of the Mexican peso between the date of invoicing and the
date of payment. To date, such payments have not been material in amount.




ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures.

Management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, has evaluated
the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Report, which we refer to as
the Evaluation Date.

As disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
report and under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Restatement,” we understated diluted earnings per share due to an incorrect
calculation of our weighted shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2003, for each of the first
three quarters of 2004, for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 and for the quarter ended
March 31, 2005. In addition, we understated basic earnings per share due to an incorrect
calculation of our weighted average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended September 30,
2004. Consequently, we have restated our financial statements for each of those periods. The
incorrect calculation resulted from a mathematical error and an improper application of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Management has concluded
that the need to restate our financial statements resulted, in part, from the lack of sufficient
experienced accounting personnel, which in turn resulted in a lack of effective control over the
financial reporting process.

As part of our growth strategy over the past five years, we have completed acquisitions of several
privately-held businesses, including closely-held entities. Prior to becoming part of our
consolidated company, these businesses were not required to implement or maintain, and did not
implement or maintain, the disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial
reporting that federal law requires of publicly-held companies such as ours. We are in the process
of creating and implementing appropriate disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls
over financial reporting at each of our recently acquired businesses. However, we have not yet
completed this process and cannot assure you as to when the process will be complete.

25



Table of Contents

In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2005, we failed to timely file a Current Report on Form
8-K relating to the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with recent stock option
and warrant exercises. The current report, which was due to be filed in November 2005, was filed in
February 2006.

As a result of the issues described above, our management has concluded that, as of the Evaluation
Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to enable us to record, process,
summarize, and report information required to be included in our SEC filings within the required
time period, and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial accounting officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There were the following changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period
covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting:




 
•
 
We continued the engagement of an independent internal controls consulting firm which is
in the process of documenting, analyzing, identifying and testing internal control.


 

 
•
 
In January 2006, we hired a certified public accountant to be our new financial
reporting manager, the existing financial reporting manager was promoted to manager of
internal controls.


 

 
•
 
During the quarter we replaced two divisional controllers with certified public
accountants.


 

 
•
 
During the quarter we consolidated most of our accounting functions into one office. We
believe this has resulted in better utilization and supervision of accounting resources.


 

 
•
 
During the quarter we began the process of consolidating our payroll functions to
improve quality control over the process.


 

 
•
 
During the quarter we completed the implementation of our new general ledger accounting
software in all of our subsidiaries existing as of December 31, 2005. We continue to
implement improvements in the way the software is utilized.






PART II. OTHER INFORMATION




ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The legal
proceedings are at different stages; however, we believe that the likelihood of material loss
relating to any such legal proceeding is remote.




ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

During the three months ended March 31, 2006, we issued 313,442 shares of our common stock to
private investors upon the exercise of previously issued warrants. The exercise price of the
warrants was $2.50 per share resulting in total proceeds to us of $783,605. The proceeds were used
in the normal course of operations for general corporate purposes. The transaction was exempt from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Regulation D
promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act.

During the three months ended March 31, 2006, we also issued 400 shares of our common stock to
Robert E. Nederlander, one of our directors, upon the exercise of previously granted stock options.
The exercise price of the options was $13.75 per share resulting in total proceeds to us of
$5,500. The proceeds were used in the normal course of operations for general corporate purposes.
The transaction was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.

issued and outstanding for all purposes and held in escrow by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Escrow
Agent”) until 18 months after the Closing Date (the “Escrow Termination Date”) pursuant
to the terms of an escrow agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B
(the “Escrow Agreement”); provided, however, that if on the Escrow Termination Date any
claims for indemnification have not been resolved or paid in full, such Escrow Termination Date
shall be extended and that portion of the Stock Consideration having a value, determined as of the
Escrow Termination Date, equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of the claims for indemnification
that have not been resolved or paid in full and (ii) US$35 million shall be held in escrow by the
Escrow Agent for so long as any of such claims for indemnification have not been resolved or paid
in full. When a claim has been resolved or paid in full, the portion of the Stock Consideration
having a value equal to the amount of the claim that has been resolved or paid in full, determined
at the time the claim has been resolved or paid in full, shall no longer be subject to the
provisions hereof. At any time following the Closing and prior to the Escrow Termination Date, the
Escrow Agent will release the Stock Consideration to Sellers provided that Sellers deliver to
Escrow Agent either (i) a letter of credit in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
C issued by a commercial bank listed in the Escrow Agreement or any other commercial bank
reasonably acceptable to Buyer in the amount of the lesser of (x) the value of the portion of the
Stock Consideration to be released from escrow and (y) US$35 million (or, in the event Sellers have
previously paid amounts under the indemnification provisions hereof, an amount equal to US$35
million less such amounts previously paid) that may be drawn upon as specified in the Escrow
Agreement to satisfy any Seller’s indemnification obligations hereunder or (ii) a copy of an
insurance policy in form and substance reasonable acceptable to Buyer issued by an insurance
company reasonably acceptable to Buyer that will provide the Escrow Agent with the lesser of (x)
the value of the portion of the Stock Consideration to be released from escrow and (y) US$35
million (or, in the event Sellers have previously paid amounts under the indemnification
provisions hereof, an amount equal to US$35 million less such amounts previously paid) in coverage
for damages arising under this Agreement that would otherwise be payable by Sellers pursuant to the
indemnification provisions hereof. Such letter of credit or insurance policy would by its terms
remain in full force and effect until the Escrow Termination Date. On the Escrow Termination Date,
the Escrow Agent shall deliver to Sellers the remaining Stock Consideration or, as the case may be,
any letter of credit or release the insurance policy delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to
this Section 2.3.

     (b) On and after the Escrow Termination Date, Sellers shall be jointly and severally liable
for any indemnity obligation under Article VII. Sellers agree that during the period from
the Escrow Termination Date until the termination of the period during which claims can be asserted
by Buyer under Article VII, the aggregate shareholder equity of Sellers shall not be less
than US$35 million (or, in the event Sellers have previously paid amounts under the indemnification
provisions of this Agreement, an amount equal to US$35 million less such amounts previously paid)
(the “Post Termination Date Cap Amount”). On the Escrow Termination Date and annually
thereafter, within 30 days after completion of Sellers’ audited annual financial statements,
Sellers shall provide to Buyer a letter (a “Confirmation Letter”) from their auditors confirming that the aggregate Sellers’ shareholders equity is not less than the
Post Termination Date Cap Amount. In addition, during the calendar month that is the sixth month

6



 

after the date of a Confirmation Letter, Sellers shall provide to Buyer a letter from their
auditors that there has not been any change since the date of such last Confirmation Letter that
reduces the aggregate shareholder equity of Sellers below the then applicable Post Termination Date
Cap Amount.

     Section 4.26 Securities Laws.

contract, undertaking, agreement, understanding or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or
pledge to any Person any part or all of the Stock Consideration which such Seller is acquiring, or
any interest therein, nor has any present plans to enter into the same. Each Seller agrees that it
will not transfer any of the Stock Consideration except in compliance with applicable United States
and other applicable securities laws.

     (b) Each Seller is an “accredited investor” within the meaning of Regulation D under the
Securities Act and was not organized solely for the purpose of acquiring any of the Stock
Consideration. Each Seller has adequate means of providing for its current needs and
contingencies, has no need now, and anticipates no need in the foreseeable future, to sell its
portion of the Stock Consideration, and currently has sufficient net worth and financial liquidity
to afford a complete loss of its investment in the Buyer. Each Seller has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters so that such Seller is capable of evaluating the
merits and risks of an investment in the Buyer and has made such evaluation. Each Seller fully
understands that the Stock Consideration is a speculative investment which involves a high degree
of risk of loss of such Seller’s entire investment. No person or entity, other than the Buyer or
its authorized representatives, has offered the Stock Consideration to any Seller. Each Seller is
able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Stock Consideration.

     (c) Each Seller understands that the Buyer has not registered the Stock Consideration under
the Securities Act, and each Seller agrees that the Stock Consideration may not be sold or
transferred or offered for sale or transfer by it without registration under the Securities Act or
the availability of an exemption therefrom. Each Seller has had an opportunity to ask questions of
and receive answers from the management and authorized representatives of the Buyer, and to review
any other relevant documents and records concerning the business of the Buyer, including all of the
Buyer Reports (as defined in Section 5.7), and the terms and conditions of this investment,
and that any such questions have been answered to such Seller’s full satisfaction. Each Seller
understands that no Governmental Authority has passed upon or made any recommendation or
endorsement of an investment in the Stock Consideration.

     Section 4.27 Customers. Since March 31, 2006, none of the customers set forth on
Schedule 4.27 has cancelled or otherwise modified its relationship with the Company or any
Subsidiary and no such Person has advised Sellers of any intention to do so and, to the knowledge
of any Seller, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not adversely affect
any of such relationships if the Company continues to conduct the Business in a manner consistent
with past practices.

22

has been affected in any material way as a result of flood, fire, explosion or other casualty.

to the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of or in connection with the transfer of assets from

Argentina. The proceedings described in Schedule 4.8 are not liabilities for purposes of
this Section 4.29. Attached as Schedule 4.29 is a true copy of the Memorandum
dated April 17, 2006 received by the Company from the Company’s tax consultants relating to such
transfer of assets.

     Section 4.30 No Other Representation or Warranties. EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE IV, SELLERS ARE NOT MAKING ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WRITTEN, ORAL OR STATUTORY, CONCERNING THE SHARES, EQUITY INTEREST,
THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT OR THE BUSINESS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY OR ANY OF THE

REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY TO BUYER WITH RESPECT TO ANY FINANCIAL PROJECTION OR FORECAST RELATING
TO THE BUSINESS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY OR ANY OF THE SUBSIDIARIES.

or notifications to any Governmental Authority or third party are necessary in connection with the

     (d) Buyer and Sellers shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from
any Governmental Authority whose permit, consent, approval, order, waiver or authorization is

     Section 6.8 Further Assurances. Each of the parties hereto shall execute such documents and other papers and perform such
further acts as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof and consummate the

agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement.

     Section 6.10 Updated Schedules.

     (a) Prior to Closing, Sellers shall supplement and/or otherwise amend its disclosure
schedules, including by the addition of new schedules with respect to any representations and
warranties of Sellers in this Agreement for which no schedule was provided as of the date hereof
(the disclosure schedules as supplemented and/or otherwise amended and any such new schedules, the

agreements of Sellers contained in this Agreement are untrue or inaccurate in any respect, then
Buyer shall inform Sellers of such fact promptly following Buyer’s obtaining actual knowledge of
such fact. In the event Buyer fails to inform Seller of such fact as required pursuant to this
Section 6.10, such failure will constitute a waiver of Buyer’s right to seek

33



 

indemnification as a result of such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement being untrue or
inaccurate because of such fact.

     (c) If at any time on or before the Closing Date, Sellers obtain any actual knowledge

such fact. In the event Sellers fail to inform Buyer of such fact as required pursuant to this

untrue or inaccurate because of such fact.

     Section 6.11 Access To Records After Closing Date. From and after the Closing Date,
each of the parties shall permit the other party reasonable access to any records or other
documents with respect to the Company or the Subsidiaries in its possession, and the right to
duplicate such records or other documents at such party’s own expense, to the extent that the

they authorize or permit any of their Affiliates, the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their
respective advisors, representatives, officers or directors (collectively, the “Seller
Representatives”), directly or indirectly, to (a) solicit, initiate, encourage or take any
action to solicit, initiate or encourage, any inquiries or communications or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, or (b) participate or engage in any
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to or take any other action with the

Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. Sellers shall promptly notify each Seller
Representative of its obligations under this Section 6.12. Without limiting the foregoing,
it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth above by the Company, any Subsidiary
or any other Seller Representative, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of
any Seller, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.12 by Sellers.

Mutual Release substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the “Mutual
Release”) pursuant to which each Seller (on the one hand) and the Company (on the other hand)
will release one another and their respective Affiliates from all pre-Closing obligations except as
set forth in agreements to be executed at Closing.

34



 

     (a) Non-Compete. During the period from the Closing Date until the third anniversary

shall cause their respective Affiliates to not, without prior written consent of Buyer, directly or
indirectly, solicit for hire or hire, any Person currently employed by the Company or any
Subsidiary; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not prevent any Seller or any
Affiliate of a Seller, without such consent, from employing any employee who (i) contacts such
party directly at his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by or
encouragement from such party, (ii) responds to a mass media solicitation or advertisement

the date of execution of this Agreement or (ii) the end of the Restricted Period, Sellers and Buyer
shall keep confidential and retain in strictest confidence, and shall not use for the benefit of
themselves or others in any way that may be competitive with, or could be detrimental to either

secrets, customer lists, details of client or consultant contracts, pricing policies, operational
methods, marketing plans or strategies, product or service development techniques or plans,
business acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition plans, methods of manufacture, technical
processes, designs and design projects, inventions and research projects of the Sellers, Buyer,
the Company or any Subsidiary learned by either Sellers or Buyer heretofore or hereafter. The
obligations and restrictions imposed on Sellers and Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.14(c)
shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than
as a result of a disclosure by Sellers or Buyer, (ii) becomes available to either Sellers or Buyer
on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than Sellers or Buyer, the Company or any
Subsidiary, but only if such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with either Sellers

information to Sellers or Buyer by a contractual, legal, fiduciary or other obligation, (iii) is
independently developed by Sellers or Buyer without reference to any confidential matters of
Sellers, Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary, or (iv) is requested or required to be disclosed by
law (including by oral question or written request for information or documents in any legal
proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar legal proceeding).

irreparably harmed in the event any of the provisions of this Section 6.14 are breached.
Accordingly, Sellers agree that Buyer shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of the

addition to any other remedy to which Buyer may be entitled, at law or in equity or pursuant to
this Agreement.

into the Investor Rights Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

     Section 6.16 Termination Fee.

     (a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(iii)
because a representation or warranty made by a Seller in Article IV hereof has either been
breached or has become untrue, and such breach or untruth is not the result of an intentional act
on the part of such Seller, then Sellers shall pay Buyer promptly, but in no event later than two
Business Days after the date of such termination, a fee of US$1,000,000, which amount shall be
payable in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer.

     (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(iv) and
the sole reason for the failure to consummate the transaction prior to the time set forth in
Section 10.1(a)(iv) is the failure to satisfy the condition set forth in Section
8.1(j), then if and only if Buyer shall not have failed to secure financing for the Cash
Consideration solely as a consequence of a pending or threatened labor strike affecting the Company
or any Subsidiary, then Buyer shall pay Sellers promptly, but in no event later than two Business
Days after the date of such termination, a fee of US$1,000,000, which amount shall be payable in
cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Sellers.

     (c) Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreement regarding the payment of
fees contained in this Section 6.16 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and that, in the absence of such agreement, Buyer and Sellers would not have
entered into this Agreement, and (ii) the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement
under the conditions described in this Section 6.16 are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.16 are reasonable
forecasts of the actual damages which may be incurred under such circumstances. The amount payable
pursuant to this Section 6.16 constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall
be the sole monetary remedy in the event of termination of this Agreement as described in this
Section 6.16.

necessary steps so that, as directed by Buyer, as of the Closing Date or immediately thereafter,

the event such boards of directors or similar managing or governing bodies consist of not more than
three appointees in the aggregate; provided, however, if such boards of directors or similar
managing or governing bodies consist of more than three appointees in the aggregate, Buyer shall
appoint, or cause to be appointed, two designees of Seller to such boards of directors or similar
managing or governing bodies.

     Section 6.19

     Buyer has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the operations, technology,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company and
the Subsidiaries and acknowledges that Sellers have provided Buyer with access to records of the
Company and the Subsidiaries. In entering into this Agreement, Buyer has relied solely upon its
own investigation and analysis, except as and only to the extent expressly set forth in this
Agreement with respect to the representations and warranties of Seller in Article IV and
subject to the limitations and restrictions contained in this Agreement.

Financial Statements, the Interim Financial Statements or disclosed in Schedule 4.14.

     (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, all sales, use,
transfer, gains, stamp, duties, recording and similar Taxes incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by Buyer, and Buyer shall, at its own
expense, accurately file or cause to be filed all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to such Taxes and timely pay all such Taxes. If required by applicable law, Sellers
will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or such other documentation.

     Section 7.2 Elections. Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries not to, amend or revoke
any Tax election if such action would adversely affect Sellers, or any Person (other than the
Company and the Subsidiaries) as to whom or with whom Sellers have filed a consolidated return,
with respect to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, or any Tax refund with
respect thereto.

     Section 7.3 Tax Indemnification.

37



 

     (a) Sellers agree to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns, and the Company and each Subsidiary from
and against any Tax Deficiency (and any related attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by any of
them based upon or arising out of: (i) Taxes imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary with respect
to taxable events occurring or taxable periods ending on or before March 31, 2006; (ii) with
respect to taxable periods beginning before March 31, 2006 and ending after March 31, 2006, Taxes
imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary which are allocable to the portion of such taxable period
ending on March 31, 2006; (iii) any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.14; and (iv) the failure by Sellers to perform any unwaived covenant or agreement
in this Article VII on their part to be performed.

     (b) If a claim for a Tax Deficiency due for the periods ending on or before March 31, 2006
which is to be borne by the Sellers as per Section 7.3(a) shall be made by any Taxing
Authority, Sellers shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such claim and may in
their sole discretion and at their sole expense pursue or forego any and all administrative
appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto, and
may, in their sole discretion, either pay the Tax Deficiency claimed and sue for a refund where
applicable law permits such refund suits or contest such claim according to the relevant
proceedings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers may not settle or compromise any such Tax
Deficiencey claim without the consent of Buyer; provided, however, that such consent to settlement
or compromise shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. In any event, the Buyer may
participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such Tax Deficiency claim but in any case, final
decision on the defense shall be adopted by the Party who has agreed to bear the cost of such Tax
Deficiency.

     (c) All matters relating in any manner to Tax indemnification obligations and payment of Taxes
shall be governed exclusively by this Article VII; provided, however, that Section
9.6(a) and Section 9.6(b) hereof shall govern as to when and to what extent claims for
indemnification hereunder may be made. The provisions of this Article VII shall survive
until 90 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations relating to the
relevant tax.

     Section 7.4 Miscellaneous. Sellers and Buyer agree to treat all payments made by them
to or for the benefit of the other (including any payments to the Company or any Subsidiary) under
this Article VII and under other indemnity provisions of this Agreement as adjustments to
the Purchase Price solely for applicable income tax purposes.

     (a) Except as may be otherwise specified in this Agreement with regard to any specific
representation and warranty, the representations and warranties of the parties set forth in this
Agreement shall terminate on the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date; provided, however,
that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1, Section 4.2,
Section 4.3, Section 4.5, Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 shall survive
indefinitely, (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.13 shall

regard to any and all tolling or other extensions of the applicable statute of limitations in
effect prior to the Closing Date, provided any extension or tolling of the applicable statute of
limitation caused by the Company after the Closing Date shall not extend the applicable statute of
limitation for purposes of this Section 9.1(a)). Notice with respect to any claim in
respect of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty shall be in writing and
shall be given to the party against which such claim is asserted on or before the date on which
such representation or warranty terminates. Neither Sellers nor Buyer shall have any liability
whatsoever with respect to any representation or warranty after the date on which such
representation or warranty terminates unless and to the extent that proper notice with respect to a
claim in respect of an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty shall be given to
the party against which such claim is asserted on or before the date on which such representation
or warranty expires.

     (b) The covenants and agreements made by the parties in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing Date in accordance with their respective terms but, if Closing occurs, any covenant and
agreement to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date shall be of no further force and effect
after the Closing Date.

     (c) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that prior to Closing, the only remedy for a breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller shall be Buyer’s option to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to and to the extent permitted by Section 10.1(a)(iii), subject to Section
6.16(a).

     (d) No party hereto (or its Affiliates) shall, under any circumstance, be liable to any other
party (or its Affiliates) for any consequential, exemplary, special, incidental or punitive damages
claimed by such other party under the terms of or due to any breach of this Agreement, including
but not limited to, loss of revenue of income, cost of capital, or loss of business reputation or
opportunity.

     Section 9.2 Obligation of Sellers to Indemnify. Subject to the limitations set forth
in Section 9.1 and Section 9.6, Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Buyer and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, and their respective successors and
assigns, from and against any Loss incurred by any of them based upon or arising out of (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty made by Sellers in this Agreement; and (ii) the failure by
Sellers to perform any unwaived covenant or agreement in this Agreement on its part to be
performed.

     Section 9.3 Obligation of Buyer to Indemnify. Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 9.1 and Section 9.6, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Sellers and their directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, and their respective successors and
assigns, from and against any Loss incurred by any of them based upon or arising out of (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement; and (ii) the failure by
Buyer to perform any unwaived covenant or agreement in this Agreement on its part to be performed.

     Section 9.4 Notice and Opportunity to Defend Against Third Party Claims.

42



 

     (a) Promptly after receipt from any third party by either party hereto (the
“Indemnitee”) of a notice of any demand, claim or circumstance that, immediately or with
the lapse of time, would give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of
any action, proceeding or investigation (an “Asserted Liability”) that may result in a Loss
for which indemnification may be sought hereunder, the Indemnitee shall give written notice thereof
(the “Claims Notice”) to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.2 or 9.3 (the “Indemnifying Party”); provided, however, that a failure to
give such notice shall not prejudice the Indemnitee’s right to indemnification hereunder except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced or forfeits substantive rights or defenses as
a result of such failure. The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable
detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be
suffered by the Indemnitee. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 9.4 with
regard to Claims Notices shall be deemed to affect the limitations set forth in Section
9.1.

     (b) The Indemnifying Party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense and by its
own counsel, any Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or defend such
Asserted Liability, it shall, within 20 Business Days following its receipt of the Claims Notice
notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the
Indemnitee of its election as herein provided or contests its obligation to provide indemnification
under this Agreement, the Indemnitee may pay, compromise or defend such Asserted Liability.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnitee may settle or
compromise any Asserted Liability without the consent of the other party; provided, however, that
such consent to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. In any event, the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party may
participate, at their own expense, in the defense of such Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying
Party chooses to compromise or defend any Asserted Liability, the Indemnitee shall make available
to the Indemnifying Party any books, records or other documents within its control that are
necessary or appropriate for such defense.

     Section 9.5 Tax Indemnification. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article
IX or any other provision of this Agreement, any issue or matter relating to Taxes shall be
governed solely by Article VII, except that the survival of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 4.14 shall be governed by both Article VII and
Section 9.1 hereof and that the provisions of Section 9.6(a) and (b) shall apply to
Article VII as noted in Article VII and Section 9.6(a) and Section
9.6(b).

     Section 9.6 Limits on Indemnification.

     (a) No party shall have any right to seek indemnification under this Agreement with respect to
Losses contemplated by Article VII, Section 9.2 or Section 9.3 that would
otherwise be indemnifiable hereunder (including Losses incurred by all other Indemnitees affiliated
with or related to such party) until such Losses exceed US$1,000,000 in the aggregate (the
“Threshold”), provided that Losses contemplated by Article VII, Section 9.2
or Section 9.3 must equal or exceed US$25,000 to count towards the Threshold and to be
indemnifiable pursuant to such sections, it being understood by the parties that once the Threshold
has been exceeded then the

43



 

Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all Losses (other than Losses
that are less than US$25,000), including those Losses comprising the Threshold; provided, however,
that the provisions of this Section 9.6(a) shall not apply to (x) any breach by Sellers of
the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.1, Section 4.2,
Section 4.3, Section 4.5, and Section 4.29, or (y) the failure by any party
to this Agreement to perform any unwaived covenant or agreement in this Agreement on its part to be
performed. After the Closing, the remedies provided by Article VII or this Article
IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the parties to this Agreement with respect to any
dispute arising from, or related to, this Agreement, except in the case of fraud and except that
injunctive relief (including specific performance) shall continue to be available to the extent
such remedy is in respect of a then surviving representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

     (b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the aggregate liability of Sellers under
Article VII and this Article IX shall be limited to an amount equal to
US$35,000,000; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this Section 9.6(b)
shall not apply to (i) any breach by Sellers of the representations, warranties and covenants
contained in Section 4.1, Section 4.2, Section 4.3, Section 4.5 and
Section 4.29, or (ii) the failure by Sellers to perform any unwaived covenant or agreement
in this Agreement on its part to be performed. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement,
solely with respect to any breach by Sellers of the representations, warranties and covenants
contained in Section 4.29, the liability of Sellers shall be limited to an amount equal to
the Purchase Price. Furthermore, subject to the preceding provisions of this Section
9.6(b), prior to (but not on or after) the Escrow Termination Date, Sellers’ indemnification obligations hereunder shall be satisfied solely out of the assets
held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.3; provided, however, that if the aggregate
value of the Stock Consideration in escrow has been reduced as a result of an indemnifiable breach
of a representation or warranty made by Sellers in Article IV and as a result of such
breach, the aggregate value of the assets in escrow is insufficient to satisfy any such
indemnification obligation up to $35 million (or, in the event Sellers have previously paid amounts
under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement, an amount equal to $35 million less such
amounts previously paid), then to the extent such reduction in value was the result of the
indemnifiable breach of representation or warranty by Sellers, Sellers shall be liable in respect
of such indemnification obligations severally and not jointly (with such liability assigned based
upon the identity of the misrepresenting party); provided, further, however, that Sellers’
indemnification obligations in respect of the matters addressed in the proviso to the first
sentence of this Section 9.6(b) and the matters addressed in the second sentence of this
Section 9.6(b) shall not be limited to the assets, if any, held by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to Section 2.3, but instead, shall be satisfied first out of such assets, and
thereafter Sellers shall remain liable in respect of any such indemnification obligations that
remain unstatisfied out of such escrowed assets, with such liability being assigned severally and
not jointly. Except as expressly otherwise provided in Section 2.3(b) and the introduction
to Article IV, the liability of Sellers under this Agreement shall be several and not
joint.

     (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the liability of Buyer under this
Article IX shall be limited to an amount equal to US$35,000,000; provided, however, that
the limitation set forth in this Section 9.6(c) shall not apply to the failure by Buyer to
perform any unwaived covenant or agreement in this Agreement on its part to be performed.

44



 

     Section 9.7 Netting of Losses

     The amount of any Losses incurred by either Sellers or Buyer for which indemnification is
provided under this Article IX shall take into account (a) in the case of Sellers’
indemnification obligations under Section 9.2 of this Agreement or Buyer’s indemnification
obligations under Section 9.3 of this Agreement, (i) any amounts recovered by the
Indemnitee pursuant to any indemnification by, or indemnification agreement with, any third party,
and (ii) any insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement received or
recoverable in connection with any such Losses and (b) with respect to Losses in excess of
US$5,000,000, the Tax consequences associated with such Losses and the recovery thereof. If the
amount to be netted hereunder from any payment required under Section 9.2 or Section
9.3 of this Agreement is determined after payment by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Article IX, the Indemnitee shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such
determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this
Article IX had such determination been made at the time of such payment.

     Section 9.8 Exclusive Remedies

     The provisions of this Article IX and Article VII set forth the exclusive
rights and remedies of Buyer and Sellers to seek or obtain damages or any other remedy or relief
whatsoever from any party with respect to matters arising under or in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

of such termination from the party terminating this Agreement to the other party.

terminated pursuant to Section 10.1, all obligations of the parties hereto under this
Agreement shall terminate and there shall be no liability of either party hereto to the other party

6.16, and (ii) that, subject to Section 9.1(c), nothing herein will relieve any party

pursue all available legal and equitable remedies.

will not exercise any rights the undersigned may have to require registration with the SEC of any
proposed offering or sale of a Relevant Security (including without limitation pursuant to this
Agreement).

     Section 4. Registration Rights.

     (a) Shelf Registration Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date (but no later than 30 after the Closing Date, unless a later date is agreed to in
writing by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities), the Company shall file with
the SEC a shelf registration statement on Form S-1 (or, if the Company is eligible to use such
form, Form S-3) relating to the registration of the offer and resale by the Holders of all of the
Registrable Securities (the “Registration Statement”); provided, however, that the Company shall
not be obligated to effect any such registration pursuant to this Section 4(a), or keep such
registration or the Registration Statement effective pursuant to Section 4(b)(i), during any
Blackout Period.

     (b) Registration Procedures. In the case of each registration, qualification, or
compliance effected by the Company pursuant to Section 4(a), the Company will keep each Holder
including securities therein reasonably advised in writing (which may include e-mail) as to the
initiation of each registration, qualification, and compliance and as to the completion thereof.
In addition, the Company hereby agrees as follows with respect to the Registration Statement.

     (i) The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to become and remain effective at least for a period ending with the first to
occur of (A) the sale by the Holders of all Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement, (B) the availability under Rule 144 for the Holders to immediately,
freely resell without restriction or filing with the SEC all Registrable Securities covered
by the Registration Statement, or (C) the date that is two years after the SEC Effective
Date (provided, however, that if the Company files the Registration Statement on Form S-1
and subsequently becomes eligible to use Form S-3, it may file a post-effective amendment to
such Form S-1 on Form S-3 prior to the end of such period and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement as amended to become effective until
the end of such period) (in any such case, the “Effectiveness Period”). At any time after
the end of the Effectiveness Period, if (a) the Holders Beneficially Own Registrable
Securities representing more than 10% of the fully diluted equity interests in the Company
(calculated giving effect to the exercise of all outstanding options, warrants and other
rights to purchase to acquire any Common Stock of the Company) or (b) any nominee designated
by the Investors pursuant to Section 2(a) is a member of the Board, then (x) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the written request of Holders of greater than 50% of the
Registrable Securities, the Company shall file with the SEC another shelf registration
statement on Form S-1 (or, if the Company is eligible to use such form, Form S-3) relating
to the registration of the offer and resale by the Holders of all of the Registrable
Securities, (y) the provisions of this Agreement

6



 

(including without limitation the provisions of Section 4(a) and Section 4(b)) shall
apply to such registration statement and (z) such registration statement shall be deemed to
be the Registration Statement (as defined in Section 4(a)) for purposes of this Agreement.

     (ii) If the Registration Statement becomes subject to review by the SEC, the Company
will promptly respond to all comments and diligently pursue resolution of any comments to
the satisfaction of the SEC.

     (iii) The Company will prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to
the Registration Statement and any prospectus used in connection therewith as may be
reasonably necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective during the Effectiveness
Period, and will comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement during such period in
accordance with the intended method(s) of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in
such Registration Statement.

     (iv) The Company will furnish, without charge, to each Holder (A) a reasonable number
of copies of the Registration Statement (including any exhibits thereto other than exhibits
incorporated by reference), each amendment and supplement thereto as such Holder may
request, (B) such number of copies of the prospectus included in such Registration Statement
(including each preliminary prospectus and any other prospectus filed under Rule 424 under
the Securities Act) as such Holder may request, in conformity with the requirements of the
Securities Act, and (C) such other documents as such Holder may reasonably request in order
to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holder, but only
during the Effectiveness Period.

     (v) The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the
Registrable Securities under such other applicable securities or blue sky laws of such
jurisdictions as any Holder reasonably requests as may be necessary for the marketability of
the Registrable Securities (such request to be made by the time the Registration Statement
is deemed effective by the SEC) and do any and all other acts and things which may be
reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such Holder to consummate the disposition in
such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holder; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this paragraph (v),
(B) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or (C) consent to general service
of process in any such jurisdiction.

     (vi) As promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event, the Company will
notify each Holder of such Registrable Securities at any time when a prospectus relating
thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of any event
which comes to the Company’s attention if as a result of such event the prospectus included
in the Registration Statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and the Company shall promptly prepare and furnish to such Holder a
supplement or amendment to such prospectus (or prepare and file appropriate reports under
the Exchange Act) so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable
Securities, such prospectus shall

7



 

not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
unless suspension of the use of such prospectus otherwise is authorized herein or in the
event of a Blackout Period, in which case no supplement or amendment need be furnished (or
Exchange Act filing made) until the termination of such suspension or Blackout Period.

     (vii) The Company will comply, and continue to comply during the period that the
Registration Statement is effective under the Securities Act, in all material respects with
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and with all applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by the Registration Statement.

     (viii) As promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event, the Company will
notify each Holder of Registrable Securities being offered or sold pursuant to the
Registration Statement of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order or other suspension of
effectiveness of the Registration Statement.

     (ix) The Company will permit the Holders of Registrable Securities being included in
the Registration Statement and their legal counsel, at such Holders’ sole cost and expense
to review and have a reasonable opportunity to comment on the Registration Statement and all
amendments and supplements thereto at least two Business Days prior to their filing with the
SEC.

     (x) The Company will make available for inspection by any Holder and any Inspector
retained by such Holder, at such Holder’s sole expense, all records as shall be reasonably
necessary to enable such Holder to exercise its due diligence responsibility, and cause the
Company’s officers, directors, and employees to supply all information which such Holder or
any Inspector may reasonably request for purposes of such due diligence; provided, however,
that such Holder shall hold in confidence and shall not make any disclosure of any record or
other information which the Company determines in good faith to be confidential, and of
which determination such Holder is so notified at the time such Holder receives such
information, unless (w) such Holder had, or obtained, knowledge of such information without
violation of or protection under any agreements with the Company or, to its knowledge any
third party, (x) the disclosure of such record is reasonably necessary to avoid or correct a
misstatement or omission in the Registration Statement and a reasonable time prior to such
disclosure the Holder shall have informed the Company of the need to so correct such
misstatement or omission and the Company shall have failed to correct such misstatement of
omission, (y) the release of such record is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order
from a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction or (z) the information in such
record has been made generally available to the public other than by disclosure in violation
of this Agreement or any other agreement. The Company shall not be required to disclose any
confidential information in such records to any Inspector until and unless such Inspector
shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company with respect thereto,
containing terms substantially similar to those set forth in this Section 4(b)(x), which
agreement shall permit such Inspector to disclose records to the Holder who has retained
such Inspector. Each Holder agrees that it shall, upon learning that disclosure of such

8



 

records is sought in or by a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction or
through other means, give prompt notice to the Company and allow the Company, at the
Company’s expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain a
protective order for, the records deemed confidential. The Company shall hold in confidence
and shall not make any disclosure of information concerning a Holder provided to the Company
pursuant to this Agreement unless (A) disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary
to comply with federal or state securities laws, (B) disclosure of such information to the
SEC’s Staff of the Division of Corporation Finance is reasonably necessary to respond to
comments raised by such staff in its review of the Registration Statement, (C) disclosure of
such information is reasonably necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in
the Registration Statement, (D) release of such information is ordered pursuant to a
subpoena or other order from a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction, or (E)
such information has been made generally available to the public other than by disclosure in
violation of this or any other agreement. The Company agrees that it shall, upon learning
that disclosure of such information concerning a Holder is sought in or by a court or
governmental body of competent jurisdiction or through other means, give prompt notice to
such Holder and allow such Holder, at such Holder’s expense, to undertake appropriate action
to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain a protective order for, such information.

     (xi) The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all the
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be listed or quoted on the
principal securities market on which securities of the same class or series issued by the
Company are then listed or traded.

     (xii) The Company will provide a transfer agent and registrar, which may be a single
entity, for the Registrable Securities at all times.

     (xiii) The Company will cooperate with the Holders of Registrable Securities being
offered pursuant to the Registration Statement to facilitate the timely preparation and
delivery of certificates (not bearing any restrictive legends) representing Registrable
Securities to be offered pursuant to the Registration Statement and enable such certificates
to be in such denominations or amounts as the Holders may reasonably request and registered
in such names as the Holders may request.

     (xiv) The Company will take all other reasonable actions necessary to expedite and
facilitate disposition by the Holders of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement, including without limitation making its chief executive officer,
president, chief financial officer and other appropriate officers and personnel available to
participate in marketing efforts with respect to any registered underwritten public
offering.

     (c) Suspension of Offers and Sales. Each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees
that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind
described in Section 4(b)(vi) or of the commencement of an Blackout Period, such Holder shall
discontinue and suspend disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration
Statement until such Holder’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by Section 4(b)(vi) or notice of the end of the Blackout Period, and, if so directed

9



 

by the Company, such Holder shall deliver to the Company (at the Company’s expense) all copies
(including, without limitation, any and all drafts), other than permanent file copies, then in such
Holder’s possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of
receipt of such notice.

     (d) Registration Expenses. All expenses incident to the Company’s performance of or
compliance with this Agreement, including without limitation all registration and filing fees,
messenger and delivery expenses, printing expenses, internal expenses (including without limitation
all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), all
fees and expenses associated with filings required to be made with the NASD, as may be required by
the rules and regulations of the NASD, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky
laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with blue sky
qualifications of the Registrable Securities), rating agency fees, the fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the listing of the securities to be registered on all securities exchanges on
which similar securities issued by the Company are then quoted or listed, fees and disbursements of
counsel for the Company and its independent certified public accountants, and the fees and expenses
of any other persons retained by the Company, in connection with the registration hereunder
(collectively, the “Registration Expenses”) will be borne by the Company, but not including any
roadshow expenses, fees and expenses of counsel for the Holders and any underwriting, broker or
dealer discounts or commissions attributable to the sale of Registrable Securities (which are
hereinafter referred to as “Selling Expenses”). All Selling Expenses shall be borne solely by the
Holders.

     (e) Information by Holder. The Holder or Holders of Registrable Securities included
in the Registration Statement shall furnish to the Company such information required under
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act regarding such Holder or Holders and the distribution
proposed by such Holder or Holders as the Company may request in writing. No Holder of Registrable
Securities will be entitled to have such Registrable Securities included in a Registration
Statement if such Holder does not furnish such information requested by the Company.

     (f) Indemnification.

     (i) In the event of the offer and sale of Registrable Securities held by Holders under
the Securities Act, the Company shall, and hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, each Holder, its directors, officers, partners, each other
person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities, and
each other person, if any, who controls or is under common control with such Holder or any
such underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, and expenses to which the Holder or any
such director, officer, partner or underwriter or controlling person may become subject
under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities
or expenses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof)
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in (A) the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
or (B) in any materials or information provided to investors by, or with the written
approval of, the

10



 

Company in connection with the marketing of the offering of the Shares (“Marketing
Materials”), including any road show or investor presentations made to investors by the
Company (whether in person or electronically), or any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein in light of the circumstances in which they were made not misleading, and the
Company shall reimburse the Holder, and each such director, officer, partner, underwriter
and controlling person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in
connection with investigating, defending or settling any such loss, claim, damage,
liability, action or proceeding; provided that the foregoing shall not apply, and the
Company shall not be liable, in any such case (A) to the extent that any such loss, claim,
damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or
is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged
omission from such Registration Statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus, summary prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information furnished to the Company through an instrument duly executed by or
on behalf of such Holder specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation thereof,
or (B) to the extent that the Holders failed to comply with the terms of the plan of
distribution mechanics described in the applicable prospectus. Such indemnity shall remain
in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Holders, or any such director, officer, partner, underwriter or controlling person and shall
survive the transfer of such shares by the Holder.

     (ii) As a condition to including any Registrable Securities to be offered by a Holder
in the Registration Statement, each such Holder agrees to be bound by the terms of this
Section 4(f) and to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
Company, its directors and officers, and each other person, if any, who controls the Company
within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, legal counsel and accountants for
the Company, any underwriter, any other Holder selling securities in such Registration
Statement and any controlling person within the meaning of the Securities Act of any such
underwriter or other Holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or
several, to which the Company or any such director or officer or controlling person may
become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, (A) insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement in or omission or alleged omission from such Registration Statement, any
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, if such statement or alleged statement or omission or
alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company through an instrument duly executed by or on behalf of such Holder
specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation thereof, or (B) to the extent
that the Holders failed to comply with the terms of the plan of distribution mechanics
described in the applicable prospectus. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company, or any such director,
officer, partner, underwriter or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such shares by the Holder, and such Holder shall reimburse the Company, and each such director,
officer, legal counsel and accountants, underwriter, other Holder, and controlling person
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating, defending, or

11



 

settling and such loss, claim, damage, liability, action, or proceeding; provided,
however, that such indemnity agreement found in this Section 4(f)(ii) shall in no event
exceed the gross proceeds from the offering received by such Holder.

     (iii) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of
any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in Section 4(f)(i) or Section
4(f)(ii) (including any governmental action), such indemnified party shall, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the
indemnifying party of the commencement of such action; provided, however, that the failure
of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
indemnifying party of its obligations under Section 4(f)(i) or Section 4(f)(ii), except to
the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give
notice. In case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in the
reasonable judgment of counsel to such indemnified party a conflict of interest between such
indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist or the indemnified party may have defenses
not available to the indemnifying party in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party
shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying
party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof, unless
in such indemnified party’s reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such
indemnified and indemnifying parties arises in respect of such claim after the assumption of
the defenses thereof or the indemnifying party fails to defend such claim in a diligent
manner, other than reasonable costs of investigation. Neither an indemnified nor an
indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected
without its consent. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified
party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement, which does not include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified
party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and without limiting any of the
rights set forth above, in any event any party shall have the right to retain, at its own
expense, counsel with respect to the defense of a claim.

     (iv) In the event that an indemnifying party does or is not permitted to assume the
defense of an action pursuant to Section 4(f)(iii) or in the case of the expense
reimbursement obligation set forth in Section 4(f)(i) and Section 4(f)(ii), the
indemnification required by Section 4(f)(i) and Section 4(f)(ii) shall be made by periodic
payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and
when bills received or expenses, losses, damages, or liabilities are incurred.

     (v) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4(f) is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall (A) contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or
expense as is appropriate to reflect the proportionate relative fault of the indemnifying
party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other (determined by reference to,

12



 

among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or omission relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified
party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission), or (B) if the allocation provided by
clause (A) above is not permitted by applicable law or provides a lesser sum to the
indemnified party than the amount hereinafter calculated, not only the proportionate
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, but also the relative
benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the
other, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. No indemnified party guilty
of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any indemnifying party who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

     (vi) Indemnification similar to that specified in the preceding subsections of this
Section 4(f) (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Company and each Holder
of Registrable Securities with respect to any required registration or other qualification
of securities under any federal or state law or regulation or governmental authority other
than the Securities Act.

     Section 5. Miscellaneous.

     (a) Assignment of Rights; Successors and Permitted Assignees. No Holder may assign
its rights under this Agreement to any party without the prior written consent of the Company;
provided, however, that a Holder may assign its rights under this Agreement without such
restrictions to a Permitted Assignee as long as (i) such transfer or assignment is effected in
accordance with applicable securities laws; (ii) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to
become subject to the terms of this Agreement as a Holder; and (iii) the Company is given written
notice by such Holder of such transfer or assignment, stating the name and address of the
transferee or assignee and identifying the Shares with respect to which such rights are being
transferred or assigned. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, Permitted Assignees, executors
and administrators of the parties hereto.

     (b) Notices. All notices or other communications which are required or permitted
under this Agreement shall be in writing and sufficient if delivered by hand, by facsimile
transmission, by registered or certified mail, postage pre-paid, by electronic mail, or by courier

The Investors acknowledge that by the operation of this Section 5(e), the holders of a majority of
the outstanding Registrable Securities may have the right and power to diminish or eliminate all
rights of the Holders under this Agreement.

     (f) Headings and Cross References. The headings of the several sections and
subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the

illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

and agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT B
to Stock Purchase Agreement

FORM OF
ESCROW AGREEMENT

     Escrow Agreement dated as of the effective date (the “Effective Date”) set forth on Schedule 1
attached hereto (“Schedule 1”) by and among the buyer identified on Schedule 1 (the “Buyer”), the
sellers identified on Schedule 1 (the “Sellers”) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as escrow agent
hereunder (the “Escrow Agent”).

     WHEREAS, the Buyer and the Sellers are parties to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement dated
April [___], 2006 (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which the Buyer has agreed to acquire
from the Sellers all of the issued and outstanding shares of DLS Drilling Logistics and Services
Corporation, for cash and stock consideration, the stock consideration being particularly described
on Schedule 1 (the “Stock Consideration”).

     WHEREAS, the Buyer and the Sellers have agreed to deposit in escrow with the Escrow Agent the
Stock Consideration (the “Escrow Shares”) and corresponding stock powers with respect to such
Escrow Shares (“Stock Powers”), which Stock Powers are delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(e) of the
Stock Purchase Agreement, and the Buyer and Sellers wish such deposit to be subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants hereinafter set
forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1. Appointment. The Buyer and the Sellers hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as their
escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such
appointment under the terms and conditions set forth herein.

     2. Escrow Shares; Stock Powers. Simultaneous with the execution and delivery of this
Escrow Agreement, the Sellers are depositing with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Shares and Stock
Powers. During the term of this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Shares and Stock Powers shall be held
by the Escrow Agent; provided that Sellers shall be entitled to (i) exercise all voting rights with
respect to the Escrow Shares, and (ii) all distributions or dividends received by the Escrow Agent
in connection with the Escrow Shares shall promptly, without any written instruction, be paid over
to Sellers’ account, in the case of cash distributions, or delivered to Sellers’ address in the
case of distributions other than cash, as specified in Schedule 1. Periodic statements will be
provided to the Buyer and the Sellers reflecting the number of Escrow Shares held under the Escrow
Agreement. The Buyer and the Sellers, upon written request, will receive a statement of
transaction details upon completion of any securities transaction in the Escrow Shares without any
additional cost.

     3. Substitute for the Escrow Shares. At any time during the term of this Escrow Agreement the Escrow Agent will release all or a
portion of the Escrow Shares to Sellers provided that Sellers deliver to Escrow Agent either (i) a
letter of credit issued by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., RBC Royal Bank or Citigroup Inc. in form and
substance attached hereto as Exhibit A in the amount of the lesser of (a) the aggregate value of
the Escrow Shares to be

 



 

released and (b) US$35 million (or, in the event Sellers have previously
paid amounts under the indemnification provisions under the Stock Purchase Agreement (whether
directly or indirectly through the escrow), an amount equal to US$35 million less such amounts
previously paid) that may be drawn upon as specified in the Escrow Agreement to satisfy any of
Sellers’ indemnification obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement or (ii) a copy of an
insurance policy in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer issued by an insurance
company reasonably acceptable to Buyer in the amount of the lesser of (a) the aggregate value of
the Escrow Shares to be released and (b) US$35 million (or, in the event Sellers have previously
paid amounts under the indemnification provisions under the Stock Purchase Agreement (whether
directly or indirectly through the escrow), an amount equal to US$35 million less such amounts
previously paid). The termination date of such letter of credit or insurance policy shall be 10
business days after the date that is 18 months from the effective date of this Escrow Agreement
(the “Substitute Collateral Termination Date”); provided that if the Escrow Termination Date is
extended as provided under Section 6, Sellers shall, within the period between the date that is 18
months from the effective date of this Escrow Agreement and the Substitute Collateral Termination
Date, substitute the existing letter of credit or insurance policy with a new letter of credit or
insurance policy that has a revolving monthly term and balance in an amount that is equal to the
lesser of (i) the amount of the claims for indemnification that have not been resolved or paid in
full prior to the Substitute Collateral Termination Date and (ii) the balance under the letter of
credit or insurance policy that is being replaced (or, in the event Sellers have previously paid
amounts in satisfaction of their indemnification obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement
(whether directly or indirectly through the escrow), an amount equal to such balance less such
amounts previously paid) (the “Substitute Collateral Amount”), which substitute letter of credit or
insurance policy shall be reduced each month upon renewal by the amount of the claims for the
indemnification that have been resolved or paid in full prior to such renewal; provided further,
that if the Escrow Termination Date is extended and by the third business day prior to the
Substitute Collateral Termination Date the Sellers have failed to replace the letter of credit or
insurance policy that is terminating on the Substitute Collateral Termination Date with a new
letter of credit or insurance policy in an amount that is equal to the Substitute Collateral
Amount, the Escrow Agent shall be required to draw down an amount of cash proceeds under the
existing letter of credit or insurance policy on the Substitute Collateral Termination Date in an
amount equal to the Substitute Collateral Amount. Until distribution, such cash proceeds shall be
invested in a JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. money market account, and any interest accruing on the
balance in such account shall be for the benefit of Sellers, and paid over monthly to Sellers’
account set forth on Schedule 1.

     4. Distribution in Respect of Sellers’ Indemnities under the Stock Purchase Agreement. If the Buyer delivers to the Escrow Agent a certificate of the Buyer, executed by an
authorized officer of the Buyer (a “Buyer’s Indemnity Certificate”), which Buyer’s Indemnity
Certificate shall:

          (a) state that the Buyer is entitled to indemnification under Article 9 of the Stock
Purchase Agreement (an “Indemnification Item”);

          (b) state the aggregate amount of such Indemnification Item; and

2



 


          (c) specify the nature and amount of each individual Indemnification Item,

then the Escrow Agent shall, promptly upon receipt of such Buyer’s Indemnity Certificate, deliver a
copy of such Buyer’s Indemnity Certificate via facsimile to the Sellers at the address provided for
in Schedule 1.

     If the Sellers object to any amount claimed in connection with any Indemnification Item
specified in any Buyer’s Indemnity Certificate, the Sellers shall, within 5 business days after
delivery by the Escrow Agent to the Sellers of such Buyer’s Indemnity Certificate, deliver to the
Escrow Agent a certificate (a “Sellers’ Indemnity Certificate”), (i) specifying each such amount to
which the Sellers object and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the nature and basis for each
such objection. Promptly upon receipt of a Sellers’ Indemnity Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall
deliver a copy of such Sellers’ Indemnity Certificate to the Buyer. If the Escrow Agent shall not
have received a Sellers’ Indemnity Certificate objecting to the amount claimed with respect to an
Indemnification Item within 5 business days after delivery to the Sellers of a Buyer’s Indemnity
Certificate specifying such Indemnification Item, the Sellers shall be deemed to have acknowledged
the correctness of the amount claimed on such Buyer’s Indemnity Certificate with respect to such
Indemnification Item and the Escrow Agent shall promptly thereafter transfer to the Buyer an amount
of Escrow Shares equal to the full amount claimed in the Buyer’s Indemnity Certificate as
calculated in accordance with Section 5 (or draw down the letter of credit for the benefit of the
Buyer or make a claim against the insurance policy in the event such letter of credit or insurance
policy has been substituted by the Sellers for the Escrow Shares).

     If the Escrow Agent receives, within 5 business days after delivery to the Sellers of a
Buyer’s Indemnity Certificate, a Sellers’ Indemnity Certificate objecting to the amount claimed
with respect to any Indemnification Item specified in such Buyer’s Indemnity Certificate, the
amount so objected to shall be held by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall transfer to the
Buyer, out of the Escrow Account a number of Escrow Shares equal to the amount claimed in the
Buyer’s Indemnity Certificate but not contested in the Sellers’ Indemnity Certificate as calculated
in accordance with Section 5 (or draw down the letter of credit for the benefit of the Buyer or
make a claim on the insurance policy in the event such letter of credit or insurance policy has
been substituted by the Sellers for the Escrow Shares), and shall not release additional Escrow
Shares (or cause the letter of credit to be drawn down further or a claim to be paid under the
insurance policy substituted for the Escrow Shares) except in accordance with either (i) written
instructions executed both by an authorized officer of the Buyer and by the Sellers or (ii) a Final
Judgment (as defined below), promptly after which time the Escrow Agent shall transfer to the Buyer
a number of Escrow Shares (or cause the letter of credit to be drawn or the claim to
the paid under the insurance policy) in an amount equal to the full amount set forth in the
written instructions or the judgment, as the case may be. A “Final Judgment” means the final,
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York.

     If the Buyer delivers to the Escrow Agent a certificate of the Buyer, executed by an
authorized officer of the Buyer (a “Buyer’s Release Certificate”), which Buyer’s Release
Certificate states that an Indemnification Item, in a specific amount, was satisfied by the Sellers
independent of this Escrow Agreement, then the Escrow Agent shall promptly upon receipt of such
Buyer’s Release Certificate transfer to the Sellers an amount of Escrow Shares equal to the

3



 

full
amount identified in Buyer’s Release Certificate as calculated in accordance with Section 5 (or
reduce by such amount the outstanding balance on the letter of credit or the coverage under the
insurance policy in the event such letter of credit or insurance policy has been substituted by the
Sellers for the Escrow Shares).

     At any time the Escrow Shares are distributed under this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent
shall deliver to the recipient (whether Buyer or Sellers) Stock Powers corresponding to the Escrow
Shares so delivered to such recipient.

     5. Valuing the Shares to be Released from Escrow. For purposes of valuing the Escrow
Shares under Sections 3 and 4 of this Agreement, the price per share shall be the “Average Trading
Price”, which means the Weighted Average Period Price (defined below) of the Escrow Shares for the
period of 5 Trading Days (defined below) ending immediately prior to the date that is 2 business
days prior to the date on which (i) all or a portion of the Escrow Shares will be distributed by
the Escrow Agent to Buyer in satisfaction of Sellers’ indemnity obligation under the Stock Purchase
Agreement as provided in Section 4, (i) Sellers elect to substitute a letter of credit for the
Escrow Shares, or (iii) Sellers elect and Buyer agrees to substitute an insurance policy for the
Escrow Shares. “Weighted Average Period Price” of the Escrow Shares for any period means the
quotient of (a) the sum of the Daily Dollar Trading Volume for each day during such period divided
by (b) the aggregate number of shares of Escrow Shares traded during such period. “Daily Dollar
Trading Volume” for each Trading Day during any period, means the Volume-Weighted Average Daily
Price (defined below) for such Trading Day multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of Buyer’s
common stock traded on such Trading Day. “Volume-Weighted Average Daily Price,” on any Trading Day,
means the volume-weighted average price for the Escrow Shares on the AMEX (defined below), during
the period beginning at 9:30:01 a.m., New York City time (or such other time as is the official
open of trading at the AMEX) and ending at 4:00:00 p.m., New York City time (or such other time as
is the official close of trading at the AMEX), as reported by Bloomberg Financial Services through
its “Volume at Price” (LNG A [Equity] VAP [Go]) functions (or any successor function, or if there
is no such function or such successor function, then as calculated by a nationally recognized
investment bank). The volume-weighted average price shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent.
“Trading Day” means a day during which trading in securities generally occurs on the AMEX. “AMEX”
means the American Stock Exchange.

     6. Escrow Termination Date. The Escrow Shares shall be held in escrow for 18 months from the effective date of this
Escrow Agreement (the “Escrow Termination Date”), and at the close of business on the Escrow
Termination Date the Escrow Agent shall provide Sellers a notice that details the balance of such
Escrow Shares, if any, held by the Escrow Agent, which shall be released to Sellers as promptly as
possible after such date; provided that if on the Escrow Termination Date Buyer provides written
notice to the Escrow Agent (with copy to Sellers) that claims, for indemnification under the Stock
Purchase Agreement, have not been resolved or paid in full, the Escrow Termination Date shall be
extended and the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold only that number of Escrow Shares having a
value, determined in accordance with Section 5, as of the Escrow Termination Date equal to the
lesser of (i) the amount of the claims for indemnification that have not been resolved or paid in
full and (ii) US$35 million (or, in the event Sellers have previously paid amounts in respect of
their

4



 

indemnification obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement (whether directly or
indirectly through the escrow), an amount equal to US$35 million less such amounts previously
paid).

     7. Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are
expressly set forth herein and no duties shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability
under and no duty to inquire as to the provisions of any agreement other than this Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or refraining from
acting upon any written notice, instruction or request furnished to it hereunder and believed by it
to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow
Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of
any such document. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments which may be due it
or in connection with the Escrow Shares. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken
or omitted by it in good faith except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the Escrow Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of
any loss to the Buyer or Seller. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of
its duties hereunder directly or through agents or attorneys (and shall be liable only for the
careful selection of any such agent or attorney) and may consult with counsel, accountants and
other skilled persons to be selected and retained by it. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for
anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of
any such counsel, accountants or other skilled persons. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall
be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands
from any party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Escrow
Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be
to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise in writing by all
of the other parties hereto or by a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Anything in this Escrow Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow
Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever
(including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

     8. Succession. The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by
giving 10 days advance notice in writing of such resignation to the other parties hereto specifying
a date when such resignation shall take effect. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to withhold
an amount equal to any amount due and owing to the Escrow Agent, plus any costs and expenses the
Escrow Agent shall reasonably believe may be incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the
termination of the Escrow Agreement. Any corporation or association into which the Escrow Agent
may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association
to which all or substantially all the escrow business of the Escrow Agent’s corporate trust line of
business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without further
act.

     9. Fees. The Buyer and each Seller agrees jointly and severally to (i) pay the Escrow
Agent upon execution of this Escrow Agreement and from time to time thereafter reasonable
compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder, which unless otherwise agreed in writing
shall be as described in Schedule 1 attached hereto, and (ii) pay or reimburse the Escrow Agent
upon request for all expenses, disbursements and advances, including

5



 

reasonable attorney’s fees and
expenses, incurred or made by it in connection with the preparation, execution, performance,
delivery, modification and termination of this Escrow Agreement.

     10. Indemnity. The Buyer and each Seller shall jointly and severally indemnify,
defend and save harmless the Escrow Agent and its directors, officers, agents and employees (the
“indemnitees”) from all loss, liability or expense (including the fees and expenses of in house or
outside counsel) arising out of or in connection with (i) the Escrow Agent’s execution and
performance of this Escrow Agreement (including, but not limited to, the Escrow Agent’s delivery of
notices contemplated under Section 4 of this Escrow Agreement) except in the case of any indemnitee
to the extent that such loss, liability or expense is due to the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such indemnitee, or (ii) its following any instructions or other directions from the
Buyer or the Seller, except to the extent that its following any such instruction or direction is
expressly forbidden by the terms hereof. The parties hereto acknowledge that the foregoing
indemnities shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this
Escrow Agreement. The parties hereby grant the Escrow Agent a lien on, right of set-off against
and security interest in the Escrow Shares (or substitute letter of credit or insurance policy) for
the payment of any claim for indemnification, compensation, expenses and amounts due hereunder.

     11. Account Opening Information/TINs.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT

For accounts opened in the US:

     To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal
law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When an account is opened, the Escrow Agent will
ask for information that will allow us to identify relevant parties.

For non-US accounts:

     To help in the fight against the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities we are
required along with all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that
identifies each person who opens an account. When you open an account, we will ask for information
that will allow us to identify you.

TINs:

     The Buyer and each Seller represent that its correct Taxpayer Identification Number (“TIN”)
assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or any other taxing authority is set forth in
Schedule 1. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Buyer and each Seller shall provide the Escrow
Agent with a fully executed W-8 or W-9 IRS form, which shall include the Buyer’s and Sellers’ TIN.
In addition, all dividends or other income earned under the Escrow Agreement shall be promptly be
paid to Sellers to the account set forth in Schedule 1 and reported by Sellers to the Internal
Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. Escrow Agent shall report and, as required withhold
any taxes as it determines may be required by any law or regulation in effect at

6



 

the time of the
distribution. In the absence of timely direction, all proceeds of the Escrow Fund shall be
retained in the Escrow Fund and reinvested from time to time by the Escrow Agent as provided in
Section 3. In the event that any earnings remain undistributed at the end of any calendar year,
Escrow Agent shall report to the Internal Revenue Service or such other authority such earnings as
it deems appropriate or as required by any applicable law or regulation or, to the extent
consistent therewith, as directed in writing by the Buyer and the Seller. In addition, Escrow
Agent shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate
authorities.

     12. Notices. All communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
be duly given and received:

          (a) upon delivery if delivered personally or upon confirmed transmittal if by
facsimile;

          (b) on the next Business Day (as hereinafter defined) if sent by overnight courier; or

          (c) four (4) Business Days after mailing if mailed by prepaid registered mail, return
receipt requested, to the appropriate notice address set forth on Schedule 1 or at such
other address as any party hereto may have furnished to the other parties in writing by
registered mail, return receipt requested.

     Notwithstanding the above, in the case of communications delivered to the Escrow Agent
pursuant to (ii) and (iii) of this Section 10, such communications shall be deemed to have been
given on the date received by the Escrow Agent. In the event that the Escrow Agent, in its sole discretion, shall determine that an emergency exists, the Escrow Agent may use such other
means of communication as the Escrow Agent deems appropriate. “Business Day” shall mean any day
other than a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which the Escrow Agent located at the notice
address set forth on Schedule 1 is authorized or required by law or executive order to remain
closed.

     13. Security Procedures. In the event funds transfer instructions are given (other
than in writing at the time of execution of this Escrow Agreement, as indicated in Schedule 1
attached hereto), whether in writing or by telecopier, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on
Schedule 2 hereto (“Schedule 2”), and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone
purporting to be the person or persons so designated. Each funds transfer instruction shall be
executed by an authorized signatory, a list of such authorized signatories is set forth on Schedule
2. The undersigned is authorized to certify that the signatories on Schedule 2 are authorized
signatories. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a writing
actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact
any of the authorized representatives identified in Schedule 2, the Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of
your executive officers, (“Executive Officers”), which shall include the titles of ______, as the Escrow Agent may select. Such “Executive Officer” shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent a fully executed Incumbency Certificate, and the Escrow Agent may

7



 

rely upon the
confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The Escrow Agent and the beneficiary’s
bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying numbers
provided by the Buyer or the Seller to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiary’s bank,
or (iii) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for any payment
order it executes using any such identifying number, even when its use may result in a person other
than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiary’s
bank or an intermediary bank designated. The parties to this Escrow Agreement acknowledge that
these security procedures are commercially reasonable.

     14. Miscellaneous. The provisions of this Escrow Agreement may be waived, altered,
amended or supplemented, in whole or in part, only by a writing signed by all of the parties
hereto. Neither this Escrow Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder may be assigned in whole
or in part by any party, except as provided in Section 6, without the prior consent of the other
parties. This Escrow Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of
New York. Each party hereto irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of venue, forum
non-conveniens or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to service of process by mail or in
any other manner permitted by applicable law and consents to the jurisdiction of the courts located
in the State of New York. The parties further hereby waive any right to a trial by jury with
respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising or relating to this Escrow Agreement. No
party to this Escrow Agreement is liable to any other party for losses due to, or if it is unable
to perform its obligations under the terms of this Escrow Agreement because of, acts of God, fire,
floods, strikes, equipment or transmission failure, or other causes reasonably beyond its control. This Escrow Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. Receipt of the Escrow Shares (or substituted letter of credit or insurance policy)
shall be confirmed by Escrow Agent as soon as practicable by account statement, and any
discrepancies in any such account statement shall be noted by Sellers to Escrow Agent within 30
calendar days after receipt thereof. Failure to inform Escrow Agent in writing of any
discrepancies in any such account statement within said 30-day period shall conclusively be deemed
confirmation of such account statement in its entirety. In the event of any discrepancy or
inconsistency between the provisions of this Escrow Agreement and the provisions of the Stock
Purchase Agreement, the provisions hereof shall prevail and be deemed to reflect the intent and
understanding of the parties hereto.
