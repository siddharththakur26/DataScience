Board of
    Directors; Committees

    board of directors currently has three standing committees: the
    Audit Committee, the Nominating Committee and the Compensation
    Committee.



    5



 


Audit
    Committee

 

    Our Audit Committee consists of three directors,
    Mr. McConnaughy and Mr. Germack, who serve as
    Co-Chairmen,
    and Mr. Nederlander. All of our Audit Committee members are
    “independent” under the applicable American Stock
    Exchange and SEC rules regarding audit committee membership. Our
    board of directors has determined that Mr. Germack
    qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert”
    under applicable SEC rules and regulations governing the
    composition of the Audit Committee. We pay Mr. Germack an
    additional $30,000 per year for serving as our audit committee
    financial expert.

 

    The Audit Committee assists our board of directors in fulfilling
    its oversight responsibility by overseeing and evaluating
    (i) the conduct of our accounting and financial reporting
    process and the integrity of the financial statements that will
    be provided to stockholders and others; (ii) the
    functioning of our systems of internal accounting and financial
    controls; and (iii) the engagement, compensation,
    performance, qualifications and independence of our independent
    auditors. Our board of directors adopted a written Audit
    Committee charter in March 2002, which was amended in May 2004.
    The charter is reviewed annually and revised as appropriate. A
    copy of the Audit Committee charter is available on our website
    (www.alchenergy.com).

 

    The independent auditors have unrestricted access and report
    directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee meets
    privately with, and has unrestricted access to, the independent
    auditors and all of our personnel. The Audit Committee has
    selected UHY Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp CPAs, LLP as
    our independent auditors for the fiscal years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2006.

 

    The Audit Committee held 6 meetings during 2005.

 

Compensation
    Committee

 

    The Compensation Committee consists of two independent,
    non-employee directors, Thomas E. Kelly and Thomas O.
    Whitener, Jr. The Compensation Committee formulates and
    oversees the execution of our compensation strategies, including
    by making recommendations to our board of directors with respect
    to compensation arrangements for senior management, directors
    and other key employees. The Compensation Committee also
    administers our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan. Our board of
    directors has adopted a charter for the Compensation Committee,
    a copy of which is available on our website
    (www.alchenergy.com).

 

Nominating
    Committee

 

    The Nominating Committee of our board of directors was
    established in January 2005 to select nominees for the board of
    directors. The Nominating Committee consists of
    Mr. Nederlander, as Chairman, and Mr. Whitener, both
    of whom are independent as defined for such purpose by the
    American Stock Exchange. We have no formal procedure pursuant to
    which stockholders may recommend nominees to our board of
    directors or Nominating Committee, and the board of directors
    believes that the lack of a formal procedure will not hinder the
    consideration of qualified nominees. The Nominating Committee
    utilizes a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating
    nominees for directors. Candidates may come to the attention of
    the Nominating Committee through current board members,
    stockholders and other persons. Our board of directors has
    adopted a charter for the Nominating Committee, a copy of which
    is available on our website (www.alchenergy.com).

    the fair market value on the exercise date.

 


    (3) 


    The 5% and 10% assumed rates of appreciation are prescribed by
    the rules and regulations of the SEC and do not represent our
    estimate or projection of the future trading prices of our
    common stock. The calculations assume annual compounding and
    continued retention of the options or the underlying common
    stock by the optionee for the full option term of ten years.
    Unless the market price of the common stock actually appreciates
    over the option term, no value will be realized by the optionee
    from these option grants. Actual gains, if any, on stock option
    exercises are dependent on numerous factors, including, without
    limitation, our future performance, overall business and market
    conditions, and the optionee’s continued employment with us
    throughout the entire vesting period and option term, which
    factors are not reflected in this table.

Employment
    Agreements With Management

 

    We have entered into written employment agreements with our
    executive officers as described below. Each employment agreement
    (other than the agreement of Mr. Keane, which is described
    below) provides that if the executive officer’s employment
    is terminated by us for any reason other than “cause,”
    as defined in the employment agreement, or death or disability,
    or if the executive officer is “Constructively
    Terminated,” as defined in the agreement (which definition
    includes a change in control of us if the executive officer does
    not continue employment with us or our successor), then he is
    entitled to receive his then current salary for the entire term
    of his contract, reduced by any amounts he earns for services
    during the severance period.

 

    Munawar H. Hidayatallah serves as our Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer pursuant to the terms of a three-year
    employment agreement dated as of April 1, 2004. Under the
    terms of the employment agreement, Mr. Hidayatallah
    receives an annual base salary of $400,000 subject to annual
    increase in the discretion of the board of directors. In
    addition, Mr. Hidayatallah is entitled to receive a bonus
    in an amount equal to 100% of his base salary if he meets
    certain strategic objectives specified in the agreement, and if
    he meets some but not all of such objectives may be granted a
    bonus as determined by the Compensation Committee of the board
    of directors. Mr. Hidayatallah received a signing bonus of
    $230,000 but will be required to return a pro rata portion of
    such bonus if his employment is terminated for any reason prior
    to April 1, 2007. Pursuant to the agreement, we also
    maintain a term life insurance policy in the amount of
    $2,500,000 the proceeds of which would be used to repurchase
    shares of our common stock from Mr. Hidayatallah’s
    estate in the event of his death. The number of shares purchased
    would be determined based upon the fair market value of our
    common stock, as determined by a third party experienced in
    valuations of this type, appointed by us.

 

    David Wilde serves as President and Chief Operating Officer
    pursuant to the terms of a three-year employment agreement dated
    as of April 1, 2004. Under the terms of the employment
    agreement, Mr. Wilde receives an annual base salary of
    $300,000 subject to annual review and potentially an increase by
    our board of directors, and Mr. Wilde is entitled to
    receive a bonus in an amount equal to up to 100% of his base
    salary, 50% of which is based on meeting quarterly and annual
    operating income targets. The bonus calculation is subject to
    adjustment in subsequent years.

 

    Victor M. Perez serves as our Chief Financial Officer pursuant
    to the terms of a three-year employment agreement dated as of
    July 26, 2004. Under the terms of the employment agreement,
    Mr. Perez receives an



    12



 

    annual base salary of $240,000 subject to annual review and
    potentially an increase by our board of directors. In addition,
    Mr. Perez is entitled to receive a bonus in an amount equal
    to up to 50% of his base salary if he meets certain strategic
    objectives specified in his employment agreement.

 

    Terrence P. Keane, President and Chief Executive Officer of our
    subsidiary AirComp L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company,
    is employed pursuant to an employment agreement dated
    July 1, 2003, which has a term of four years. Under the
    terms of this agreement, Mr. Keane is entitled to base
    salary of $164,000 and to a bonus of up to 90% of his base
    salary based upon AirComp meeting earnings targets established
    by AirComp’s Management Committee. If Mr. Keane’s
    employment is terminated by AirComp without cause or by
    Mr. Keane for good reason (as such terms are defined in the
    agreement), Mr. Keane will be entitled to receive his
    accrued bonus, if any, and to continue to receive salary and
    medical benefits for a period of six months. In addition, if a
    change in control (as defined in the agreement) occurs with
    respect to AirComp, and Mr. Keane does not accept
    employment with AirComp’s successor, then Mr. Keane
    will be entitled to receive his accrued bonus, if any, to
    continue to receive salary for a period of 24 months, and
    to continue to receive medical benefits for a period of
    12 months.

 

    David Bryan was appointed as the President and Chief Operating
    Officer of Strata in February 2005 pursuant to the terms of a
    three-year employment agreement dated as of April 1, 2004.
    Under the terms of the employment agreement, Mr. Bryan
    receives an annual base salary of $175,000 subject to annual
    review and potentially an increase by our board of directors. In
    addition, Mr. Bryan is entitled to receive a bonus based on
    Strata’s earnings before taxes, interest and depreciation
    provided that Strata met designated minimum earnings targets and
    provided further that such bonus shall not exceed 100% of
    Mr. Bryan’s base salary. The bonus calculation is
    subject to adjustment in subsequent years.

 

Board
    Compensation

 

    Our policy is to pay our independent directors a fee of
    $5,000 per quarter beginning in 2005.
    Messrs. Hidayatallah, Mortensen and Toboroff are not deemed
    independent for this purpose. Each independent director serving
    on a committee of the board of directors will receive $1,250
    quarterly for service on such committee and each independent
    director serving as chairman of a committee of the board of
    directors will receive an additional $1,250 per quarter for
    acting as chairman of such committee. In addition, our
    “audit committee financial expert” receives $7,500 on
    a quarterly basis. In 2004 we did not pay directors any
    compensation for their services as directors. Directors are also
    compensated for
    out-of-pocket
    travel expenses.

 

    In April 2004, we entered into an oral consulting agreement with
    Mr. Toboroff pursuant to which we paid him $10,000 per
    month during the 2005 fiscal year to advise us regarding
    financing and acquisition opportunities. Effective as of the
    first quarter of 2006, we pay Mr. Toboroff $12,000 per
    month pursuant to the agreement.

 

Compensation
    Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

 

    The Compensation Committee of our board currently consists of
    Messrs. Kelly and Whitener. Neither of these individuals
    has been our officer or employee at any time. No current
    executive officer has ever served as a member of the board of
    directors or compensation committee of any other entity (other
    than our subsidiaries) that has or has had one or more executive
    officers serving as a member of our board or our Compensation
    Committee.

 

    Mr. Whitener is a principal of Energy Spectrum, from whom
    we acquired Strata in February 2002. On April 2, 2004,
    Energy Spectrum converted all of its Series A Preferred
    Stock, including accrued dividend rights, into
    1,718,090 shares of common stock and has subsequently sold
    such common stock.

 

    Mr. Kelly was an owner and founder of Downhole Injection
    Systems, LLC, which we purchased in December 2004.
    Mr. Kelly received 117,138 shares of our common stock
    and $306,800 for his interest in Downhole Injection Systems,
    LLC. Mr. Kelly subsequently sold all but 14,201 of his
    shares in August of 2005.

ITEM 12.  


SECURITY
    OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND
    RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS




 

Security
    Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management

 

    The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of
    outstanding shares of our common stock as of April 28, 2006
    for:

 







 
    • 


    our named executive officers;


 

 
    • 


    each of our other directors;


 

 
    • 


    all of our directors and executive officers as a group; and


 

 
    • 


    each other person known by us to be a beneficial owner of more
    than 5.0% of our outstanding common stock.



 

    Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules
    of the SEC. Under the rules of the SEC, a person is deemed to be
    a “beneficial owner” of a security if that person has
    or shares “voting power,” which includes the power to
    vote or to direct the voting of such security, or
    “investment power,” which includes the power to
    dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A
    person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities
    of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership
    within 60 days. Under these rules, more than one person may
    be deemed a beneficial owner of the same securities and a person
    may be deemed a beneficial owner of securities as to which he
    has no economic interest. Except as indicated by footnote, the
    persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment
    power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by
    them, subject to community property laws where applicable.

Equity
    Compensation Plans Not Approved by Security Holders

 

    These plans comprise the following:

 

    In 1999 and 2000, the Board compensated former and continuing
    Board members who had served from 1989 to March 31, 1999
    without compensation by issuing promissory notes totaling
    $325,000 and by granting stock options to these same
    individuals. Options to purchase 4,800 shares of common
    stock were granted with an exercise price of $13.75. These
    options vested immediately and expire in March 2010. As of
    December 31, 2005, none of these options had been exercised.

 

    On May 31, 2001, our Board granted to one of our directors,
    Leonard Toboroff, an option to purchase 100,000 shares of
    common stock at $2.50 per share, expiring in October 2011.
    The option was granted for services provided by
    Mr. Toboroff to OilQuip prior to our merger with OilQuip
    Rentals, Inc., including providing financial advisory services,
    assisting in OilQuip’s capital structure and assisting
    OilQuip in finding strategic acquisition opportunities. As of
    December 31, 2005, none of these options have been
    exercised.

 

    In February 2001, we issued warrants to purchase
    233,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of
    $0.75 per share and warrants to purchase 67,000 shares
    of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share
    in connection with a subordinated debt financing. The warrants
    to purchase 233,000 shares were redeemed during December
    2004 for $1.5 million. The remaining 67,000 warrants are
    currently outstanding and expire in February 2011.

 

    In connection with the private placement in April 2004, we
    issued warrants for the purchase of 800,000 shares of our
    common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. A

CERTAIN
    RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS




 

    In July 2005, we entered into a lease of a yard in Buffalo,
    Texas which is part owned by our Chief Operating Officer, David
    Wilde. The monthly rent is $3,500. In September of 2005, we
    entered into a four year lease for a yard in Kilgore, Texas for
    $4,300 per month and a four-year lease for a yard in Corpus
    Christi, Texas for $3,500 per month with Gary Edwards, the
    President of Allis-Chalmers Tubular Services, Inc.

 

    Alya H. Hidayatallah, the daughter of our Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer, Munawar H. Hidayatallah, has served as our
    Vice President — Planning and Development since
    April 2005. In 2005, we paid Ms. Hidayatallah a salary at a
    rate of $80,000 per annum.

 

    In April 2004, we entered into an oral consulting agreement with
    Leonard Toboroff pursuant to which we paid him $10,000 per
    month during the 2005 fiscal year to advise us regarding
    financing and acquisition

    opportunities. Effective as of the first quarter of 2006, we pay
    Mr. Toboroff $12,000 per month pursuant to the
    agreement.

 

    As of December 31, 2005, Jens Mortensen, one of our
    directors, was the holder of a subordinated note payable (having
    a stated principal amount of $4.0 million and an annual
    interest rate of 7.5%), which we issued to him in connection
    with our acquisition of Tubular Services (of which
    Mr. Mortensen is a former equity holder). As of
    December 31, 2005, we owed Mr. Mortensen
    $3.0 million in principal and $60,000 in accrued interest
    on the subordinated note, all of which we paid in January 2006.
    We also owe Mr. Mortensen $267,000 under the terms of a
    non-compete agreement. During the year ended December 31,
    2005, we paid $247,000 to Mr. Mortensen under the terms of
    this non-compete agreement. We also leased a yard from
    Mr. Mortensen on a monthly basis and paid rent of $16,800
    during the year ended December 31, 2005.
