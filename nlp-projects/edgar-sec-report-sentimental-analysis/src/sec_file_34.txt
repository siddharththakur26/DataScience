PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



 
 
 
 
 




Note 1
 
-

 
The financial statements included in this report reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the Corporation’s consolidated financial position at September 30,
2003 and December 31, 2002, and the consolidated results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2003 and 2002 and the consolidated cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and
2002. The unaudited results of operations for the interim periods reported are not necessarily indicative of results to
be expected for the full year.


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
Certain notes and other information have been condensed or omitted from these interim financial statements. These
statements, therefore, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes
included in the 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders, which have been incorporated by reference in the Corporation’s Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, as updated by Form 8-K filed on November 6, 2003. Certain information in the
financial statements and notes has been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.


 
 
 
 
 


Note 2
 
-

 
In the first nine months of 2003, the Corporation took initiatives to reshape its portfolio of exploration and
production segment assets to reduce costs, lengthen reserve lives, provide capital for investment and reduce debt.


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
In the first quarter of 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude oil producing properties in Colombia (acquired in 2001
as part of the Triton acquisition), plus $10 million in cash, for an additional 25% interest in natural gas reserves in
the joint development area of Malaysia and Thailand. The exchange resulted in a charge to income of $51 million before
income taxes, which the Corporation reported as a loss from discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2003. The
loss on this exchange included a $43 million pre-tax adjustment of the book value of the Colombian assets to fair value
resulting primarily from a revision in crude oil reserves. The loss also included $26 million from the recognition in
earnings of the value of related hedge contracts at the time of the exchange. These items were partially offset by
pretax earnings in Colombia prior to the exchange of $18 million. At the time of the exchange, the exploration and
production segment included the net book value of fixed assets in Colombia of $670 million and a related deferred income
tax liability of $142 million.


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
In this exchange transaction, the Corporation acquired the 50% interest in a corporate joint venture that it did not
already own. Prior to the exchange, the Corporation accounted for its 50% interest in the corporate joint venture using
the equity method. Because of the exchange, the joint venture became a wholly owned subsidiary and now is consolidated.


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
In the second quarter of 2003, the Corporation sold producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, the Jabung Field
in Indonesia and several small United Kingdom fields. The aggregate proceeds from these sales were $445 million and the
pre-tax gain from disposition was $248 million. With respect to the assets sold in the second quarter of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



 
 
 
 
 




 
 
 
 
2003, the net
book value of fixed assets at the time of sale was approximately $295 million and the related dismantlement and deferred
tax liabilities were approximately $160 million. Income from operations of these assets prior to sale amounted to $40
million in the first nine months of 2003.


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
Sales and other operating revenues (net of intercompany sales) from discontinued operations were $97 million and $291
million in the first nine months of 2003 and 2002, respectively. The net production from fields sold or exchanged in
2003 at the time of disposition was approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
During the third quarter of 2003, the Corporation completed the exchange of its 25% equity investment in Premier Oil plc
for a 23% interest in Natuna Sea, Block A, in Indonesia.


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
On October 1, 2003, the Corporation exchanged 14% interests in the Scott and Telford fields in the United Kingdom for an
additional 22.5% interest in the Llano Field in the Gulf of Mexico and $17 million in cash. The exchange increases the
Corporation’s working interest in the Llano Field to 50% and decreases its interest in the Scott Field to 21% and the
Telford Field to 17%

The Corporation records compensation expense for nonvested common stock awards ratably over the vesting period, which is
generally five years. The Corporation uses the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options. Because
the exercise prices of employee stock options equal or exceed the market price of the stock on the date of grant, the
Corporation does not recognize compensation expense.


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options for pro forma
disclosure. Using the fair value method, stock option expense would be recognized over the one-year vesting period.
The following pro forma financial information presents the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the
Corporation used the fair value method for stock options granted during the previous year (in millions, except per share
data):

Note 12
 
-

 
On January 1, 2003, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations as
required by FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Previously, the Corporation had accrued
the estimated costs of dismantlement, restoration and abandonment, less estimated salvage values, of offshore
oil and gas production platforms and pipelines using the units-of-production method. This cost was reported as
a component of depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation. Using the new accounting method required by
FAS No. 143, the Corporation now recognizes as a liability legally required asset retirement obligations for
oil and gas production facilities in the period in which they are incurred based on the estimated fair value.
The Corporation capitalizes the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset.


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
The cumulative effect of this change on prior years resulted in a credit to income of $7 million (net of income
taxes of $18 million) or $0.08 per share, basic and diluted. The cumulative effect is included in income for
the nine months ended September 30, 2003. The effect of the change on the results for the nine months ended
September 30, 2003, compared with the previous accounting method, was to increase income before the cumulative
effect of the accounting change by $4 million, after-tax ($0.05 per share diluted).


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
The following table describes changes to the Corporation’s asset retirement obligations (in millions):

If FAS No. 143 had been applied beginning January 1, 2002 (rather than
at January 1, 2003), the pro forma liability for asset retirement
obligations at that date would have been $537 million. Assuming the
accounting change had been applied retroactively to January 1, 2002
(rather than January 1, 2003), there would not have been a material
change in income from continuing operations or net income.


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
The Corporation has adopted Emerging Issues Task Force abstract 02-3,
Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading
Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management
Activities. In accordance with EITF 02-3, the Corporation began
accounting for trading inventory purchased after October 25, 2002 at
the lower of cost or market. Inventory purchased prior to this date
was marked-to-market and reflected in income currently. Beginning
January 1, 2003, the Corporation accounted for all trading inventory at
the lower of cost or market. This accounting change did not have a
material effect on the Corporation’s income or financial position.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FIN
46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which is effective for
fourth quarter reporting. The Corporation does not presently anticipate
any material effect on its financial position or results of operations
from this Interpretation.


 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
The oil and gas industry is currently discussing the appropriate
balance sheet classification of oil and gas mineral rights held by
lease or contract. The Corporation classifies these assets as property,
plant and equipment in accordance with its interpretation of FAS No. 19
and common industry practice. There is also a view that these mineral
rights are intangible assets as defined in FAS No. 141, Business
Combinations, and, therefore, should be classified separately on the
balance sheet as intangible assets. If the accounting for mineral
rights held by lease or contract is ultimately changed, the Corporation
believes that any such reclassification of mineral rights could amount
to approximately $2.4 billion at September 30, 2003 and $2.2 billion at
December 31, 2002, if the Corporation is required to include the
purchase price allocated to hydrocarbon reserves obtained in
acquisitions of oil and gas properties. The determination of this
amount is based on the Corporation’s current understanding of this
evolving issue and how the provisions of FAS No. 141 might be applied
to oil and gas mineral rights. This potential balance sheet
reclassification would not affect results of operations or cash flows.

third quarter of 2003 included an income tax benefit of $30 million reflecting the recognition for United States income tax purposes of certain prior
year foreign exploration expenses. Results for the third quarter of 2002 included an after-tax impairment charge of $207 million ($318 million before
income taxes). Net income for the first nine months of 2003 was $574 million compared with $153 million in the first nine months of 2002. The after-tax
results by major operating activity for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 were as follows (in millions, except per share

      In the discussion which follows, the financial effects of certain
transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews
segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in
its explanation of variances in segment earnings. Such after-tax
amounts may be considered to be non-GAAP financial measures.
Management believes that they are a preferable method of explaining
variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a
transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts
are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax
jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.

      After reflecting the after-tax variances in the table above,
exploration and production earnings in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2003 decreased by $62 million and $210 million compared
with the corresponding periods of 2002. These decreases were
primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas sales volumes.

Results of Operations (Continued)
      The Corporation’s oil and gas production, on a barrel-of-oil
equivalent basis, decreased by 23% in the third quarter and 17% in the
first nine months of 2003 compared
with the corresponding periods of 2002. Approximately one-half of the
decreases are due to asset sales and the Colombia/JDA exchange. The
remainder of the decreases are principally due to natural decline in
the United States and North Sea and reduced production from the Ceiba
Field in Equatorial Guinea.


      In the third quarter of 2003, the Corporation exchanged its 25%
equity investment in Premier Oil Plc for a 23% interest in the
Indonesian Natuna A Field. In the fourth quarter, the Corporation has
also exchanged 14% interests in the Scott and Telford fields in the
United Kingdom for an additional 22.5% interest in the Llano Field in
the Gulf of Mexico, plus $17 million in cash. Production from the
Llano Field is scheduled to commence mid-year 2004.


      These transactions along with asset sales and the Colombia/JDA
exchange in the first half of the year will contribute to a decline in
production in 2004. Production in 2004 is expected to be
approximately 12% below projected full year 2003 production of
approximately 370 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Approximately 40% of the decline is due to asset sales and exchanges
and the remainder is due to natural decline.


      Production expenses increased in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting higher per barrel costs,
including increased transportation, insurance and workover costs.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were lower in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2003 principally reflecting
lower production volumes. General and administrative expenses
relating to exploration and production activities were comparable in
the third quarter of 2003 and 2002, but higher in the first nine
months of 2003, largely due to 2003 charges for accrued severance in
London, Aberdeen and Houston and costs of a reduction in leased office
space in London. Exploration expense was lower in the third quarter
of 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting the timing of exploration
drilling and higher capitalization of drilling costs in the 2003
quarter.


      After-tax foreign currency losses amounted to $3 million ($2
million gain before income taxes) in the third quarter of 2003 and $16
million ($15 million before income taxes) in the first nine months of
2003, compared with income of $11 million and $15 million ($6 million
and $25 million before income taxes) in the corresponding periods of
2002. The pre-tax amounts of foreign currency gains and losses are
included in non-operating income (expense) in the income statement.


      The effective income tax rate for exploration and production
operations in the first nine months of 2003 was 52%. This rate
includes income taxes in excess of the United States statutory rate in
several producing areas, such as the United Kingdom and Norway. It
also reflects the income tax deduction for the Corporation’s hedging
results at only the U.S. statutory rate. In addition, certain
expenses in foreign jurisdictions are not deductible for income tax
purposes, or are benefited at rates equal to or below the U.S.
statutory rate. Each of these factors

increases the Corporation’s
overall exploration and production effective income tax rate. The
full year 2003 exploration and production effective income tax rate is
expected to be comparable to the rate for the first nine months of the
year.


      The Corporation’s future exploration and production earnings may
be impacted by volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and
natural gas, reserve and production changes, fluctuations in foreign
exchange rates and changes in tax rates.


Refining and Marketing
      Refining and marketing income amounted to $89 million in the
third quarter of 2003 compared with $70 million in the corresponding
period of 2002. For the first nine months of 2003, refining and
marketing earnings were $272 million compared with income of $65
million in 2002. Refining and marketing earnings include the
following after-tax items in the third quarter and first nine months
of 2003 and 2002 (in millions):

was $9 million.

The pre-tax amount of this charge was $35 million.


      HOVENSA
      The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income was $43 million in
the third quarter of 2003 compared with a loss of $6 million in the
third quarter of 2002. The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income in
the first nine months of 2003 was $108 million compared with a loss of
$50 million in the first nine months of 2002. The increase was due to
higher refining margins and sales volumes in both periods compared to
the prior year. Income taxes on the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s
results are not recorded due to available loss carryforwards.


      The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s crude runs amounted to
218,000 barrels per day in the first nine months of 2003 compared with
175,000 barrels per day in the first nine months of 2002. The fluid
catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for a portion of the
first half of 2002. Crude runs were reduced in 2002 due to downtime
at this unit and low refining margins. HOVENSA is currently

receiving
its contracted quantities of crude oil from PDVSA after political
disturbances in Venezuela earlier in the year interrupted crude oil
deliveries.


      Refining and marketing earnings also included interest income of
$23 million (before and after income taxes) in the first nine months
of 2003 and $27 million in the first nine months of 2002 on the note
received from PDVSA V.I. in connection with the formation of the joint
venture.


      Retail, energy marketing and other
      Retail gasoline operations were more profitable in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2003 than in the corresponding
periods of 2002, reflecting higher margins and increased sales volumes
at gasoline stations. Earnings from energy marketing activities were
also higher in the third quarter and first nine months of 2003.
Energy marketing earnings were particularly strong during the early
part of 2003 reflecting increased margins and sales volumes from the
colder winter. Results of the Port Reading refining facility also
improved in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting improved refining
margins.


      Total refined product sales volumes increased by 11% to 114
million barrels in the first nine months of 2003 compared with the
same period of 2002. The increase was largely due to higher demand
for distillates and residual fuel oils.


      The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives.
The Corporation also takes trading positions in addition to its
hedging program. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading
activities, including its share of the earnings of the trading
partnership, amounted to income of $3 million ($8 million before
income taxes) in the third quarter of 2003 and income of $15 million
($26 million before income taxes) in the first nine months of 2003.
Trading activities resulted in losses of $14 million ($20 million
before income taxes) in the third quarter of 2002 and income of $4
million ($8 million before income taxes) in the first nine months of
2002.


      Refining and marketing earnings will likely continue to be
volatile reflecting competitive industry conditions and supply and
demand factors, including the effects of weather.


Corporate
      Net corporate expenses were $25 million in the third quarter and
$73 million in the first nine months of 2003, compared with $23 and
$56 million in the same periods of 2002. Corporate expenses in the
first nine months of 2003 include after-tax charges of $15 million
($27 million before income taxes) from early repayment of debt. The
amount in the corresponding period of 2002 was $4 million ($10 million
before income taxes). The pre-tax expense for early debt repayment is
recorded in other non-operating income (expense) in the income
statement.

Results of Operations (Continued)
Interest
      After-tax interest expense amounted to $42 million in the third
quarter of 2003 compared with $36 million in the third quarter of 2002
($73 million and $61 million before income taxes, respectively). In
the first nine months of 2003, after-tax interest expense amounted to
$132 million compared with $127 million in the same period of 2002
($224 million and $194 million before income taxes). Interest
incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of 2003 was lower
than in 2002 because of debt reduction, however, the reduction in
interest incurred was more than offset by lower interest capitalized
in 2003. Pre-tax capitalized interest amounted to $31 million in the
first nine months of 2003 compared with $75 million in the
corresponding period of 2002.


Discontinued Operations
      In the first quarter of 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude
oil producing properties in Colombia, plus $10 million in cash, for an
additional 25% interest in Block A-18 in the joint development area of
Malaysia and Thailand. The exchange resulted in an after-tax charge
to income in the first quarter of 2003 of $47 million ($51 million
before income taxes), which the Corporation reported as a loss from
discontinued operations. The loss on this exchange included a $43
million adjustment of the book value of the Colombian assets to fair
value. The loss also included $17 million from the recognition in
earnings of the value of related hedge contracts at the time of the
exchange. These items were partially offset by after-tax earnings in
Colombia prior to the exchange of $13 million.


      In the second quarter of 2003, the Corporation sold Gulf of
Mexico Shelf properties, the Jabung Field in Indonesia and several
small United Kingdom fields for $445 million. An after-tax gain from
these asset sales of $175 million ($248 million before income taxes)
was included in discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2003.
Discontinued operations in the first nine months of 2003 also
includes $40 million of income from operations prior to the sales of
these assets.


Change in Accounting Principle
      The Corporation adopted FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, effective January 1, 2003. A net after-tax
gain of $7 million resulting from the cumulative effect of this
accounting change was recorded at the beginning of the year. At the
date of adoption, a liability of $556 million representing the
estimated fair value of the Corporation’s required dismantlement
obligations was recorded on the balance sheet. In addition, a
dismantlement asset of $311 million was recorded, as well as
accumulated depreciation of $203 million.

quarter and 28% in the first nine months of 2003, compared with the
corresponding periods of 2002. These increases principally reflect
higher sales volumes of refined products and the increased selling
price of purchased natural gas in energy marketing operations.


Liquidity and Capital Resources
      Net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in
operating assets and liabilities, amounted to $1,159 million in the
first nine months of 2003 compared with $1,427 million in the first
nine months of 2002.


      In 2003, the Corporation has taken initiatives to reshape its
portfolio of producing assets to reduce future costs, lengthen its
reserve to production ratio, and provide capital for investment in new
fields and funds to reduce debt. The Corporation exchanged producing
properties in Colombia for an increased interest in a non-producing
property under development in the joint development area of Malaysia
and Thailand. The Corporation’s Colombia properties (acquired in 2001
as part of the Triton acquisition), plus $10 million in cash, were
exchanged for an additional 25% interest in natural gas reserves in
the joint development area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA). The JDA
production facilities are complete, but production will not commence
until the construction of a natural gas pipeline and gas plant is
completed by the purchasers of the gas. It is anticipated that
production will begin in late 2005. The Corporation also sold certain
producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, the Jabung Field in
Indonesia, several small United Kingdom fields and an interest in a
shipping joint venture. The aggregate proceeds from these sales were
$508 million. The net production from fields sold or exchanged at the
time of disposition was approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent
per day.


      In the third quarter of 2003, the Corporation completed the
exchange of its 25% equity investment in Premier Oil plc for a 23%
interest in Natuna Sea Block A in Indonesia, plus approximately $10
million in cash (including closing adjustments). Current production
from the Corporation’s 23% interest in Natuna is approximately 5,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day.


      In October 2003, the Corporation exchanged 14% interests in the
Scott and Telford fields in the United Kingdom for an additional 22.5%
interest in the Llano Field in the Gulf of Mexico and $17 million in
cash. The exchange increases the Corporation’s working interest in
the Llano Field to 50% and decreases its interest in the Scott Field
to 21% and the Telford Field to 17%. Production from the United
Kingdom interests being transferred was approximately 10,000 barrels
per day in the third quarter of 2003. Production from the
Corporation’s 50% interest in the Llano Field is scheduled to commence
in the second quarter of 2004.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)
      The asset sales accelerated cash flows into 2003 that would have
been received over the productive lives of the assets. The proceeds
from asset sales, as well as operating cash flow, will provide capital
for the development of new fields, as well as funds to repay debt.
The Corporation believes the overall impact of its program of asset
sales and exchanges of properties has not reduced its liquidity in the
short-term or over the next five years.


      Based on current estimates of production, capital expenditures
and other variables, and assuming quarter-end oil and gas prices, the
Corporation anticipates it will fund its future operations, including
capital expenditures and required debt repayment, with cash flow from
operations, and, when necessary, available borrowing capacity under
its presently undrawn, committed revolving credit agreement totaling
$1.5 billion, and proceeds of issuances of securities under the shelf
registration described below. The Corporation’s revolving credit
agreement expires in 2006 and the Corporation expects it will be able
to arrange a new committed facility at that time, if required. It is
possible that there will be a modest increase in total debt over the
next five quarters.


      On November 6, 2003, the Corporation filed a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3. This registration, when effective, will allow
the Corporation to issue from time to time the following securities:
debt securities, shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock and
warrants to purchase common stock, preferred stock or debt securities.
The aggregate initial offering price of all securities that could be
issued by the Corporation under the registration statement will not
exceed $1,500 million. The proceeds, if any, will be used for general
corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions and the reduction or refinancing of
existing indebtedness.


      Total debt decreased by $502 million at September 30, 2003 from
$4,992 million at December 31, 2002. The Corporation’s debt to
capitalization ratio was 48.8% at September 30, 2003 compared with
54.0% at December 31, 2002.


      At September 30, 2003, loan agreement covenants allow the
Corporation to borrow an additional $3.3 billion for the construction
or acquisition of assets. The amount that can be borrowed under the
loan agreements for the payment of dividends is $1.2 billion. At
September 30, 2003, the Corporation has $1.5 billion of additional
borrowing capacity available under its revolving credit agreement and
has additional unused lines of credit for $206 million under
uncommitted arrangements with banks.


      The Corporation has lease financings, a portion of which are
leveraged lease financings not included in its balance sheet,
primarily related to retail gasoline stations. The net present value
of the financings is $462 million at September 30, 2003, using
interest rates inherent in the leases. The Corporation’s September 30
debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 48.8% to 51.2% if the
lease financings were included.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)
      While the Corporation continues to maintain investment grade
credit ratings, two rating agencies have reduced their ratings of the
Corporation’s debt during 2003. The rating changes did not result in
the termination or reduction of any of the Corporation’s debt or
leasing capacity, nor were principal or interest payments accelerated.
The Corporation’s commercial paper ratings have also been reduced,
which has restricted its
ability to access the commercial paper market. However, it has $1.5
billion in unused revolving credit capacity available. Certain
contracts with hedging and trading counterparties require additional
cash margin or collateral of up to approximately $43 million because
of the downgrade. The Corporation estimates the change in credit
ratings increased financing costs by less than $1 million annually.


      In October 2003, one rating agency placed the Corporation’s
long-term debt and commercial paper ratings under review for possible
downgrade. If the Corporation’s credit rating were to be reduced by
this agency below investment grade, the Corporation may be required to
provide additional security under a lease with remaining payments of
$39 million and to comply with more stringent financial covenants
contained in debt instruments assumed in the Triton acquisition,
unless it elects to defease these obligations. The Corporation would
have been in compliance with such covenants as of the balance sheet
date. In addition, the amount of cash margin or collateral required
under contracts with hedging and trading counterparties at September
30, 2003 would increase by approximately $64 million. A downgrade
below investment grade would increase annual financing costs by $5
million.


      The Corporation and PDVSA equally guarantee the payment of the
value of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than
PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on
the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at September
30, 2003 amounted to $96 million.


      In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding, in
proportion to its 50% interest, to the extent HOVENSA does not have
funds to meet its senior debt obligations prior to coker financial
completion, as defined. At September 30, 2003, the Corporation’s
pro-rata share of HOVENSA’s senior debt was $84 million after
deducting HOVENSA funds available for debt service. In October 2003,
coker financial completion was achieved and the maximum pro-rata share
of funding became $40 million. After completion of construction
required to meet final low sulfur fuel regulations, this amount
reduces to $15 million.


      In connection with the sale of six vessels in 2002, the
Corporation agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate on these
vessels for up to five years. The support agreement requires that if
the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is less than
the stipulated support rate in the agreement the Corporation will pay
to the buyer the difference between the contracted rate and the
stipulated rate. At January 1, 2003, the charter support reserve was
$48 million. During the first nine months of 2003, the Corporation
paid $3 million of charter support, reducing the reserve to $45
million.

      In the second quarter of 2003, the Corporation recorded an
after-tax charge of $23 million for accrued severance and a reduction
in leased office space in London. The pre-tax amount of this charge
was $38 million, of which $21 million relates to leased office space.
The remainder of $17 million relates to severance for positions that
were eliminated in London, Aberdeen and Houston. Through September
30, approximately $4 million of the severance has been paid. Over
700 employee and contractor positions have been or will be eliminated
or will be transferred to other operators. Approximately 280
employees will be receiving severance, which will be paid principally
in the fourth quarter and 2004. Additional accruals for severance and
lease costs of approximately $22 million before income taxes are
anticipated over the next several quarters. The
estimated annual savings from this cost reduction initiative is
approximately $50 million before income taxes.


      Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2003 were $1,015
million of which $958 million related to exploration and production
activities. Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2002
were $1,207 million, including $1,101 million for exploration and
production. Capital expenditures for the remainder of 2003 are
currently estimated to be approximately $420 million. These
expenditures are expected to be funded by available cash or cash flow
from operations. Capital expenditures in 2004 excluding acquisitions,
if any, are currently expected to be $1.5 billion.


Market Risk Disclosure
      In the normal course of business, the Corporation is exposed to
commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural
gas, refined products and electricity. In the disclosures that
follow, these operations are referred to as non-trading activities.
The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50%
voting interest in a trading partnership. These activities are also
exposed to commodity risks principally related to the prices of crude
oil, natural gas and refined products.


      Instruments: The Corporation uses forward commodity contracts,
foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps and options in the
Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are
widely traded instruments with standardized terms.


      Quantitative Measures: The Corporation uses value-at-risk to
monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non-trading
activities. The value-at-risk model uses historical simulation and
the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at
a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second
order sensitivities for options. The potential change in fair value
based on commodity price risk is presented in the non-trading and
trading sections below.


      Non-Trading: The Corporation’s non-trading activities include
hedging of crude oil and natural gas production. Futures and swaps
are used to fix the selling prices

Market Risk Disclosure (Continued)
of a portion of the Corporation’s future production and the related
gains or losses are an integral part of the Corporation’s selling
prices. As of September 30, the Corporation has open hedge positions
equal to 60% of its estimated 2003 worldwide crude oil production for
the period October 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003, 60% of estimated 2004
worldwide crude oil production and 15% of estimated 2005 production.
The average price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) related open hedge
positions is $26.38 in 2003, $24.62 in 2004 and $25.03 in 2005. The
average price for Brent related open hedge positions is $24.34 in
2003, $23.74 in 2004 and $23.79 in 2005. Approximately 15% of the
Corporation’s hedges are WTI related and the remainder are Brent. The
Corporation has no open hedges of natural gas production at September
30, 2003. As market conditions change, the Corporation may adjust its
hedge positions.


      The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined
petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses
futures and swaps to fix the purchase prices of commodities to be sold
under fixed-price sales contracts.


      The Corporation estimates that at September 30, 2003, the
value-at-risk for commodity related derivatives that are settled in
cash and used in non-trading activities was $41 million ($50 million
at December 31, 2002). The results may vary from time to time as
hedge levels change.


      Trading: The trading partnership in which the Corporation has a
50% voting interest trades energy commodities and derivatives. The
accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the
Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own
account. These strategies include proprietary position management and
trading to enhance the potential return on assets. The information
that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the
Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts.


      In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in
crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices, primarily in North
America and Europe. Trading positions include futures, swaps and
options. In some cases, physical purchase and sale contracts are used
as trading instruments and are included in the trading results.


      Derivative trading transactions are marked-to-market and are
reflected in income currently. Total net realized gains, before
income taxes, for the first nine months of 2003 amounted to $35
million and net unrealized gains were $68 million. The following
table provides a compilation of the factors affecting the changes in
fair value of trading contracts in the first nine months of 2003 and
represents 100% of the trading partnership and other trading
activities (in millions):

Critical Accounting Policies
      Accounting policies affect the recognition of assets and
liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet and revenues and
expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can
affect net income, stockholders’ equity and various financial
statement ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies
generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.



 
24


Table of Contents
PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)

       



Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)
      As explained below there are significant differences in the way
long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for
impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets,
including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
recovered. Long-lived assets are tested at the lowest level for which
cash flows are identifiable and are largely independent of the cash
flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the
long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted
future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss
is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair
value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated future net
cash flows.


      In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future
net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future
prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices
and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes
of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the
risks involved. The projected production volumes represent reserves,
including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a
stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes,
prices and timing of production are consistent with internal
projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas
prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ
from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net
cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of actual
prices on the last day of the year.


      The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived exploration and
production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future
production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices,
operating and capital costs and the timing of future production, which
are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The
Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes
on oil and gas fields were reduced. Significant extended declines in
crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset
impairments.


      The Corporation has recorded $977 million of goodwill in
connection with the purchase of Triton. Factors contributing to the
recognition of goodwill included the strategic value of expanding
global operations to access new growth areas outside of the United
States and the North Sea, obtaining critical mass in Africa and
Southeast Asia, and synergies, including cost savings, improved
processes and portfolio high grading opportunities. In accordance
with FAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but must be tested
for impairment annually. FAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be tested
for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units
used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined
primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A
reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one
level below an operating segment. A component is a reporting unit if
the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial
information is available and segment management regularly reviews the
operating results of that component. However,


 
25


Table of Contents
PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)

       



Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)
two or more components
of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single
reporting unit if the components have similar economic
characteristics. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a
reporting unit if all of its components are economically similar.


      Within the exploration and production operating segment there are
currently two components: (1) Americas and West Africa and (2) Europe,
North Africa and Asia. Each component has a manager who reports to
the segment manager. The Corporation has determined the components
have similar economic characteristics and, therefore, aggregates the
components into a single reporting unit – the exploration and
production operating segment. As a result, goodwill has been assigned
to the exploration and production operating segment. If the
Corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such
that there was more than one operating segment or if its components
were no longer economically similar, goodwill would be assigned to two
or more reporting units. The goodwill would be allocated to any new
reporting units using a relative fair value approach in accordance
with FAS No. 142. Goodwill impairment testing for lower level
reporting units could result in the recognition of an impairment that
would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of
aggregation.


      The Corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be
recovered through the operation of the exploration and production
segment as a whole and it evaluated the following characteristics in
determining that the components are economically similar:




•
 
The Corporation operates its exploration and production
segment as a single, global business.




•
 
Each component produces oil and gas.




•
 
The exploration and production processes are similar in each component.




•
 
The methods used by each component to market and distribute oil and gas are similar.




•
 
Customers of each component are similar.




•
 
The components share resources and are supported by a
worldwide exploration team and a shared services organization.


      The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the exploration and
production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash
flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the expected
risked present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated
market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for
potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business
opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased
market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market
valuation of similar exploration and production companies.


      The determination of the fair value of the exploration and
production operating segment depends on judgments about oil and gas
reserves, future prices, timing of


 
26


Table of Contents
PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)

       



Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)
future net cash flows and market
premiums. The effect of synergies is embedded in the value of
producing assets, known developments and exploration assets.
Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices,
reduced reserve estimates or failure to realize synergies could lead
to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production
operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. In
addition, changes in management structure or sales or dispositions of
a portion of the exploration and production segment may result in
goodwill impairment.


      As explained above, there are significant differences in the way
long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for
impairment testing. Consequently, there may be impairments of
individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the $977
million of goodwill assigned to the exploration and production
segment. In 2002, the Corporation recognized asset impairments
because reduced estimates of oil and gas production volumes caused the
expected undiscounted cash flows of the assets to be lower than the
asset carrying amounts. No impairment of goodwill exists because the
fair value of the overall exploration and production operating segment
continues to exceed its recorded book value.


      The Corporation has two operating segments: (1) exploration and
production and (2) refining and marketing. Management has determined
that these are its operating segments because, in accordance with FAS
No. 131, these are the segments of the Corporation (i) that engage in
business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are
incurred, (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the
Corporation’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about
resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance
and (iii) for which discrete financial information is available. Mr.
John B. Hess, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation, is the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) as defined
in FAS No. 131, because he is responsible for performing the functions
within the Corporation of allocating resources to and assessing the
performance of the Corporation’s operating segments. Mr. Hess uses
only the operating results of each segment as a whole to make
decisions about resources to be allocated to each segment and to
assess the segment performance. The CODM manages each segment
globally and does not regularly review the operating results of any
component (e.g., geographic area) or asset within each segment or any
information by geographical location, oil and gas property or project,
subsidiary or division, to make decisions about resources to be
allocated or to assess performance. While the CODM does review and
approve initial corporate funding for a new project using information
about the project, he does not review subsequent operating results by
project after the initial funding. Each operating segment has one
manager. The segment managers are responsible for allocating
resources within the segments, reviewing financial results of
components within the segments, and assessing the performance of the
components. The CODM evaluates the performance of the segment
managers based on performance metrics related to each manager’s
operating segment as a whole. The Board of Directors of the
Corporation does not receive more detailed information than that used
by the CODM to operate and manage the Corporation.

Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)
      The oil and gas industry is currently discussing the appropriate
balance sheet classification of oil and gas mineral rights held by
lease or contract. The Corporation classifies these assets as
property, plant and equipment in accordance with its interpretation of
FAS No. 19 and common industry practice. There is also a view that
these mineral rights are intangible assets as defined in FAS No. 141,
Business Combinations, and, therefore, should be classified separately
on the balance sheet as intangible assets. If the accounting for
mineral rights held by lease or contract is ultimately changed, the
Corporation believes that any such reclassification of mineral rights
could amount to approximately $2.4 billion at September 30, 2003 and
$2.2 billion at December 31, 2002, if the Corporation is required to
include the purchase price allocated to hydrocarbon reserves obtained
in acquisitions of oil and gas properties. The
determination of this amount is based on the Corporation’s current
understanding of this evolving issue and how the provisions of FAS No.
141 might be applied to oil and gas mineral rights. This potential
balance sheet reclassification would not affect results of operations
or cash flows.

Item 1.
 
Legal Proceedings




On August 11, 2003 a purported class action complaint was filed in the
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey by Michael
Kennedy, on behalf of himself and other class members, against Amerada
Hess Corporation, John B. Hess, John Y. Schreyer, members of the
Registrant’s Employee Benefit Plans Committee and other unnamed
fiduciaries. The members of the purported class are participants in
Registrant’s Savings and Stock Bonus Plan who maintained investments
through the Plan in the Registrant’s common stock between February 9,
2001 and the present (the “Class Period”). The complaint alleges that
the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under the Employment
Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) resulting in losses to
plaintiff in Registrant’s common stock during the Class Period. This
complaint is substantially identical to an earlier purported class
action complaint filed by Martin Falk in May 2003. Registrant
believes these actions are without merit.



As reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-K annual report for 2002,
over the last five years, many refiners have entered into consent
agreements to resolve EPA’s assertions that these facilities were
modified or expanded without complying with New Source Review
regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain
circumstances and other regulations which impose emissions control
requirements. These consent agreements, which arise out of an EPA
enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities,
have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and
required significant capital expenditures to install emissions control
equipment. EPA contacted the Corporation and HOVENSA regarding the
petroleum refinery initiative in August, 2003. While EPA has not made
any specific assertions that the Corporation or HOVENSA violated the
New Source Review regulations, the Corporation and HOVENSA expect to
have further discussions with EPA regarding the petroleum refining
initiative.



The Corporation, along with other companies engaged in refining and
marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits and claims related
to the use of the methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A
series of substantially identical lawsuits, many involving water
utilities or governmental entities, have been recently filed in
jurisdictions across the United States against refiners and producers
of MTBE. The principal allegation is that gasoline containing MTBE is
a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable for
damage to groundwater resources and required to take remedial action
to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of
MTBE. Additional property damage and personal injury lawsuits and
claims related to the use of MTBE are expected. Prior product
liability based litigation has been resolved without a material effect
on the Corporation and the United States Congress is considering a
limitation on product liability lawsuits for the use of MTBE in
gasoline. While the damages claimed in these actions is substantial,
Registrant believes, based on current factual and legal
circumstances, that these actions will not have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition.
