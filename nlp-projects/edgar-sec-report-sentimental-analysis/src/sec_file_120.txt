NOTES
      TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS









 
      


(Unaudited)










1.  


The
      accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
      been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
      for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q
      and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not
      include all of the information and footnotes required by generally
      accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the
      opinion of management, these financial statements contain all adjustments,
      consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the
      financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
      indicated. Results of operations for the periods presented herein are not
      necessarily indicative of results of operations for the entire
      year.  The condensed consolidated financial statements include
      the accounts of AMR Corporation (AMR or the Company) and its wholly owned
      subsidiaries, including (i) its principal subsidiary American Airlines,
      Inc. (American) and (ii) its regional airline subsidiary, AMR Eagle
      Holding Corporation and its primary subsidiaries, American Eagle Airlines,
      Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. (collectively, AMR Eagle). The condensed
      consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of variable
      interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. For
      further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and
      footnotes included in AMR’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 21,
      2009 (the Form 8-K).  The Form 8-K reflects retrospective
      application of the Company’s accounting for convertible debt under
      Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position APB 14-1 (FSP APB
      14-1), “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in
      Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement),” which was
      adopted on January 1, 2009, as required.  Further, in connection
      with preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements and in
      accordance with the recently issued Statement of Financial Accounting
      Standards No. 165 “Subsequent Events” (SFAS 165), the Company evaluated
      subsequent events after the balance sheet date of June 30, 2009 through
      July 15, 2009.






During
the first and second quarters of 2009, the Company experienced continued
significant weakening of the revenue environment, especially in international
markets, due to the worldwide economic recession.  Lower revenues,
coupled with the recent severe disruptions in the capital markets and other
sources of funding, and the recent increase in fuel prices, have negatively
impacted the Company and significantly impacted its results of operations and
cash flows for the three and six months ended June 30,
2009.  Consequently, the Company’s liquidity has been negatively
affected as unrestricted cash and short-term investments decreased from
$3.1 billion as of December 31, 2008 to $2.8 billion at June 30,
2009.  In addition, the Company may not be able to improve its
liquidity position for the remainder of 2009 if the overall industry revenue
environment does not improve and if the Company is unable to obtain adequate
additional funding.

 
The Company also remains
heavily indebted and has significant obligations.  As of the date of
this Form 10-Q, the Company believes it can access sufficient liquidity
to fund its operations and obligations for the remainder of 2009, including
repayment of debt and capital leases, capital expenditures and other contractual
obligations.  However, no assurance can be given that the Company will
be able to do so.


In June
2009, in response to the challenges it faces, the Company announced further
capacity reductions in an effort to balance supply and demand.  AMR
will reduce mainline seating capacity by approximately 7.5 percent for the full
year 2009 versus 2008.  The reduction consists of an approximately 9.0
percent reduction in mainline domestic capacity and more than 4.0 percent
reduction in mainline international capacity compared to the year ending
December 31, 2008.  As a result, for the quarter ending September 30,
2009, AMR expects mainline domestic capacity to decline by approximately 10.5
percent and mainline international capacity to decline by 6.0 percent compared
to the quarter ending September 30, 2008.

Through
June 30, 2009, the Company secured approximately $470 million of financing
through loans on certain aircraft and the sale leaseback financing of certain
aircraft.  The Company also issued pass through trust certificates on
July 7, 2009 (as described in Note 5 to these condensed consolidated financial
statements) raising approximately $520 million to finance both currently owned
aircraft and future aircraft deliveries.  Exclusive of these
transactions, the Company estimates that it has at least $3.7 billion in
unencumbered assets and other sources of liquidity and the Company continues to
evaluate the most cost-effective alternatives to raise additional
capital.  The Company’s possible financing sources primarily include:
(i) a limited amount of additional secured aircraft debt or sale leaseback
transactions involving owned aircraft; (ii) leases of or debt secured by new
aircraft deliveries; (iii) debt secured by other assets; (iv) securitization of
future operating receipts; (v) the sale or monetization of certain assets; (vi)
unsecured debt; and (vii) issuance of equity and/or equity-like securities.
Besides unencumbered aircraft, the Company’s most likely sources of liquidity
include the financing of AAdvantage program miles and takeoff and landing slots
and the sale or financing of certain of the Company’s business units and
subsidiaries, such as AMR Eagle.

 
For
additional information regarding the Company’s possible financing sources, see
Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.

In June 2009, American entered
      into an amendment to a purchase agreement with The Boeing Company
      (Boeing). Pursuant to the
      amendment, American
      exercised rights to purchase an additional eight 737-800
      aircraft and the delivery dates of certain
      aircraft were rescheduled.  As a result,
      American’s total
      737-800 purchase commitments for 2009 (including nine aircraft that have
      been delivered as of June 30, 2009) have increased from 29 as of March 31,
      2009 to 31 as of
      June 30, 2009, and
      American’s 737-800 purchase commitments for 2010 have increased from 39 as of
      March 31, 2009 to 45 as of June 30, 2009.  American’s 737-800
      purchase commitments remain at eight in 2011.  In addition to
      these aircraft, American has firm commitments for eleven 737-800 aircraft
      and seven Boeing 777 aircraft scheduled to be delivered in
      2013-2016.




 
As of
June 30, 2009, payments for American’s 737-800 and 777 aircraft purchase
commitments will approximate $716 million for the remainder of 2009, $1.3
billion in 2010, $354 million in 2011, $217 million in 2012, $399 million in
2013, and $556 million for 2014 and beyond. These amounts are net of purchase
deposits currently held by the manufacturer.
 
American
previously arranged backstop financing which, together with other financing arranged through the date
of this filing, including the pass through certificate financing referred
to in Note 5 in these condensed consolidated financial statements, covers all of
its 2009-2011 Boeing 737-800 aircraft deliveries, subject to certain terms and
conditions (including, in the case of one of the financing arrangements covering
twelve aircraft, a condition that at the time of borrowing, the Company has a
certain amount of unrestricted cash and short term investments).
 

AMR's
subsidiaries lease various types of equipment and property, primarily aircraft
and airport facilities.  The future minimum lease payments required
under capital leases, together with the present value of such payments, and
future minimum lease payments required under operating leases that have initial
or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of June 30,
2009, were (in millions):

At June
30, 2009 the Company was operating 180 jet aircraft and 39 turboprop aircraft
under operating leases and 77 jet aircraft under capital leases.





 
      


On
      December 18, 2007, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objection
      (SO) against 26 airlines, including the Company.  The SO alleges
      that these carriers participated in a conspiracy to set surcharges on
      cargo shipments in violation of European Union (EU) law.  The SO
      states that, in the event that the allegations in the SO are affirmed, the
      Commission will impose fines against the Company.  The Company
      intends to vigorously contest the allegations and findings in the SO under
      EU laws, and it intends to cooperate fully with all other pending
      investigations.  Based on the information to date, the Company
      has not recorded any reserve for this exposure for the quarter ended June
      30, 2009. In the event that the SO is affirmed or other investigations
      uncover violations of the U.S. antitrust laws or the competition laws of
      some other jurisdiction, or if the Company were named and found liable in
      any litigation based on these allegations, such findings and related legal
      proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the Company. 









3.  


Accumulated
      depreciation of owned equipment and property at June 30, 2009 and December
      31, 2008 was $10.2 billion and $9.9 billion,
      respectively.  Accumulated amortization of equipment and
      property under capital leases at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was
      $541 million and $536 million,
respectively.









4.  


As
      discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in the Form
      8-K, the Company has a valuation allowance against the full amount of its
      net deferred tax asset. The Company currently provides a valuation
      allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that
      some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The
      Company’s deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased approximately
      $20 million during the six months ended June 30, 2009 to $2.8 billion as
      of June 30, 2009, including the impact of comprehensive income for the six
      months ended June 30, 2009 and changes from other
    adjustments.





The
Company estimates that the unrecognized tax benefit recorded under Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes”, may decrease during the next twelve months based on anticipated
resolution of a pending Internal Revenue Service Appeals process. Changes in the
unrecognized tax benefit will have no impact on the effective tax rate due to
the existence of the valuation allowance.





5.


As
      of June 30, 2009, AMR had issued guarantees covering approximately $1.2
      billion of American’s tax-exempt bond debt and American had issued
      guarantees covering approximately $425 million of AMR’s unsecured
      debt.  In addition, as of June 30, 2009, AMR and American had
      issued guarantees covering approximately $284 million of AMR Eagle’s
      secured debt and AMR has issued guarantees covering an additional $2.0
      billion of AMR Eagle’s secured
debt.





The
Company adopted FASB Staff Position APB 14-1 (FSP APB 14-1), “Accounting for
Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion
(Including Partial Cash Settlement)” as of January 1, 2009, and the adoption
impacted the historical accounting for the 4.25 percent senior convertible notes
due 2023 (the 4.25 Notes) and the 4.50 percent senior convertible notes due 2024
(the 4.50 Notes), and resulted in increased interest expense of approximately
$14 million for the three months ended June, 30 2008 and increased interest
expense of approximately $5 million and $26 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  In addition, the adoption
resulted in an increase to paid in capital of $207 million with an offset to
accumulated deficit of $206 million and current portion of long term debt of $1
million as of January 1, 2009.  The impact to loss per share was an
increase of $0.06 for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and an increase of $0.02
and $0.11 for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008.  The
Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K on April 21, 2009 to reflect the
adoption of FSP APB 14-1 for the 2008, 2007 and 2006 financial
statements.

The 4.25
Notes were retired in 2008.  In the first quarter of 2009, AMR
retired, by purchasing with cash $318 million principal amount of its 4.50
Notes.  Virtually all of the holders of the 4.50 Notes exercised their
elective put rights and the Company purchased and retired these notes at a price
equal to 100 percent of their principal amount.  Under the terms of
the 4.50 Notes, the Company had the option to pay the purchase price with cash,
stock, or a combination of cash and stock, and the Company elected to pay for
the 4.50 Notes solely with cash.

During
the six months ended June 30, 2009, the Company raised approximately $204
million under loans secured by various aircraft. The loans generally bear
interest at a LIBOR-based (London Interbank Offered Rate) variable rate with a
fixed margin which resets quarterly and are due in installments through
2019.

American
has a secured $433 million term loan credit facility with a final maturity on
December 17, 2010 (the Credit Facility).  American’s obligations under
the Credit Facility are guaranteed by AMR.  The Credit Facility
contains a covenant (the Liquidity Covenant) requiring American to maintain, as
defined, unrestricted cash, unencumbered short term investments and amounts
available for drawing under committed revolving credit facilities of not less
than $1.25 billion for each quarterly period through the life of the Credit
Facility.  AMR and American were in compliance with the Liquidity
Covenant as of June 30, 2009.  In addition, the Credit Facility
contains a covenant (the EBITDAR Covenant) requiring AMR to maintain a ratio of
cash flow (defined as consolidated net income, before interest expense (less
capitalized interest), income taxes, depreciation and amortization and rentals,
adjusted for certain gains or losses and non-cash items) to fixed charges
(comprising interest expense (less capitalized interest) and
rentals).  In June 2009, AMR and American entered into an amendment to
the Credit Facility which waived compliance with the EBITDAR Covenant for the
quarter ended June 30, 2009; however, even absent this waiver the Company would
have complied with this covenant as of June 30, 2009.  In addition,
the amendment reduced the minimum ratios AMR is required to satisfy to 0.95 to
1.00 for the one, two and three quarter periods ending September 30, 2009,
December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010, respectively, to 1.00 to 1.00 for the four
quarter period ending June 30, 2010, and to 1.05 to 1.00 for the four quarter
period ending September 30, 2010.

Given the
volatility of fuel prices and revenues, uncertainty in the capital markets and
uncertainty about other sources of funding, and other factors, it is difficult
to assess whether the Company will be able to continue to comply with the
Liquidity Covenant and the EBITDAR Covenant, and there are no assurances that it
will be able to do so.  Failure to comply with these covenants would
result in a default under the Credit Facility which — if the Company did not
take steps to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate, the default — could
result in a default under a significant amount of its other debt and lease
obligations, and otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company and its
ability to sustain its operations.
 
On July
7, 2009, American closed a $520 million Pass Through Trust Certificates (the
Certificates) financing covering four Boeing 777-200ER aircraft owned by
American and 16 of American’s next 59 Boeing 737-800
deliveries.  Equipment notes underlying the Certificates bear interest
at 10.375% per annum and principal and interest on the notes are payable in
semi-annual installments with a balloon payment at maturity in
2019.  Approximately $153.7 million of the proceeds from the sale of
the Certificates were received by American at closing in exchange for equipment
notes secured by the four Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, which were treated as debt
at the time of issuance of the Certificates.  The remainder of the
proceeds is being held in escrow for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates.  When American finances each of the 16 Boeing 737-800
aircraft under this arrangement, an allocable portion of the proceeds will be
released to American in exchange for equipment notes secured by the individual
aircraft and such debt will be recorded by American.  American
currently expects that it will use the escrowed proceeds of the Certificates to
finance 16 Boeing 737-800 aircraft to be delivered to American between July 2009
and March 2010, but American could elect to use this financing on any 16 of its
next 59 Boeing 737-800 aircraft deliveries currently scheduled for delivery
between July 2009 and October 2010.
 
In
addition, a third party is holding collateral from American to cover interest
distributable on the Certificates prior to when the 16 Boeing 737-800 aircraft
are delivered and the related equipment notes are issued.
 
Once
fully issued, American will hold variable interests in the pass through trusts
created for the Certificates, but is not expected to be the primary
beneficiary.

Unrealized gains or losses on short term investments, restricted cash and

recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at each measurement
date.

In April
2009, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position SFAS
107-1 and Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 28-1, “Interim
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB
28-1).  The FSP amends SFAS 107, “Disclosures about Fair Values of
Financial Instruments,” to require disclosures about fair value of financial
instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial
statements.  The FSP also amends APB Opinion 28, “Interim Financial
Reporting," to require those disclosures in all interim financial
statements.  The FSP is effective for interim periods ending after
June 15, 2009.  The Company has adopted FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB 28-1
and has provided the additional disclosures required.





 
      


The
      fair values of the Company's long-term debt were estimated using quoted
      market prices where available.  For long-term debt not actively
      traded, fair values were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses,

      similar types of borrowing
arrangements.

The
Company has no required 2009 contributions to its defined benefit pension plans
under the provisions of the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004 and the Pension
Protection Act of 2006.  The Company’s estimates of its defined
benefit pension plan contributions reflect the current provisions of the Pension
Funding Equity Act of 2004 and the Pension Protection Act of
2006.  The Company expects to contribute approximately $13 million to
its retiree medical and other benefit plan in 2009.
 
In
December 2008, the FASB affirmed Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff
Position SFAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit
Plan Assets” (FSP SFAS 132(R)-1).  FSP SFAS 132(R)-1 requires
additional disclosures about assets held in an employer’s defined benefit
pension or other postretirement plan, primarily related to categories and fair
value measurements of plan assets.  The FSP is effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2009 and will only impact the disclosures of the
Company’s pension assets.

As
      a result of the revenue environment, high fuel prices and the Company’s
      restructuring activities, including its capacity reductions, the Company
      has recorded a number of charges during the last few
      years.  The following table
      summarizes the components of the Company’s special charges, the remaining
      accruals for these charges and the capacity reduction related charges (in

As
      part of the Company's risk management program, it uses a variety of
      financial instruments, primarily heating oil option and collar contracts,
      as cash flow hedges to mitigate commodity price risk.  The
      Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
      trading purposes.  As of June 30, 2009, the Company had fuel
      derivative contracts outstanding covering 26 million barrels of jet fuel
      that will be settled over the next 24 months.  A deterioration
      of the Company’s liquidity position may negatively affect the Company’s
      ability to hedge fuel in the
future.





For the
quarter and six months ended June 30, 2009, the Company recognized an increase
of approximately $197 million and $465 million, respectively, in fuel expense on
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to its fuel
hedging agreements, including the ineffective portion of the
hedges.  For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2008, the
Company recognized a decrease of approximately $340 million and $447 million,
respectively, in fuel expense related to its fuel hedging agreements including
the ineffective portion of the hedges.  The net fair value of the
Company’s fuel hedging agreements at June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
representing the amount the Company would pay to terminate the agreements (net
of settled contract assets), totaled $30 million and $450 million, respectively,
which excludes a payable related to contracts that settled in the last month of
each respective reporting period.  As of June 30, 2009, the Company
estimates that during the remainder of 2009 it will reclassify from Accumulated
other comprehensive loss into fuel expense approximately $190 million in net
losses (based on prices as of June 30, 2009) related to its fuel derivative
hedges, including losses from terminated contracts with a bankrupt counterparty
and unwound trades.

The
Company includes changes in the fair value of certain derivative financial
instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities in comprehensive income. For the three month
periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, comprehensive income (loss) was $99
million and $(839) million, respectively, and for the six month periods ended
June 30, 2009 and 2008, comprehensive income (loss) was $(87) million and $(1.0)
billion, respectively. Total comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31,
2008 was $(6.0) billion.  The difference between net
earnings (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for the three and six month
periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 is due primarily to the accounting for the
Company’s derivative financial instruments and the Company’s pension
plans.

The
Company is also exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by
counterparties to these financial instruments, and although no assurances can be
given, the Company does not expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet its
obligations.  The credit exposure related to these financial
instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair
value at the reporting date, reduced by the effects of master netting
agreements.  To manage credit risks, the Company selects
counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single
counterparty under defined guidelines, and monitors the market position of the
program and its relative market position with each counterparty. The Company
also maintains industry-standard security agreements with a number of its
counterparties which may require the Company or the counterparty to post
collateral if the value of selected instruments exceed specified mark-to-market
thresholds or upon certain changes in credit ratings.
 
As of
June 30, 2009, the aggregate fair value of all cash flow derivatives qualifying
under SFAS 133 with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a
liability position is $58 million, for which the Company had posted collateral
of $59 million. The Company was over-collateralized as of June 30, 2009 due to a
timing lag in collateral reconciliation with a certain
counterparty.
 
In
addition to the Company’s qualifying cash flow hedges, American has hedges that
were effectively unwound as in 2008 that are recorded as assets and liabilities
on the balance sheet.  The fair value of these offsetting positions
not designated as hedges under SFAS 133 as of June 30, 2009 was a $76 million
asset recorded in Fuel derivative contracts and a $76 million liability recorded
in Fuel derivative liability.

Item
      2.  Management's
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations






Forward-Looking
Information

Statements
in this report contain various forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which represent the Company's
expectations or beliefs concerning future events.  When used in this
document and in documents incorporated herein by reference, the words "expects,"
"plans," "anticipates," “indicates,” “believes,” “forecast,” “guidance,”
“outlook,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “targets” and similar expressions
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Similarly, statements that
describe the Company’s objectives, plans or goals are forward-looking
statements.  Forward-looking statements include, without limitation,
the Company’s expectations concerning operations and financial conditions,
including changes in capacity, revenues, and costs; future financing plans and
needs; the amounts of its unencumbered assets and other sources of liquidity;
fleet plans; overall economic and industry conditions; plans and objectives for
future operations; regulatory approvals and actions, including the Company’s
application for antitrust immunity with other oneworld alliance members; and
the impact on the Company of its results of operations in recent years and the
sufficiency of its financial resources to absorb that impact.  Other
forward-looking statements include statements which do not relate solely to
historical facts, such as, without limitation, statements which discuss the
possible future effects of current known trends or uncertainties, or which
indicate that the future effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot be
predicted, guaranteed or assured.  All forward-looking statements in
this report are based upon information available to the Company on the date of
this report.  The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update
or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information,
future events, or otherwise.  Guidance given in this report regarding
capacity, fuel consumption, fuel prices, fuel hedging, and unit costs, and
statements regarding expectations of regulatory approval of the Company’s
application for antitrust immunity with other oneworld members are
forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking
statements are subject to a number of factors that could cause the Company’s
actual results to differ materially from the Company’s
expectations.  The following factors, in addition to other possible
factors not listed, could cause the Company’s actual results to differ
materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements:  the
materially weakened financial condition of the Company, resulting from its
significant losses in recent years; weaker demand for air travel and lower
investment asset returns resulting from the severe global economic downturn; the
Company’s need to raise substantial additional funds and its ability to do so on
acceptable terms; the ability of the Company to generate additional revenues and
reduce its costs; continued high and volatile fuel prices and further increases
in the price of fuel, and the availability of fuel; the Company’s substantial
indebtedness and other obligations; the ability of the Company to satisfy
existing financial or other covenants in certain of its credit agreements;
changes in economic and other conditions beyond the Company’s control, and the
volatile results of the Company’s operations; the fiercely and increasingly
competitive business environment faced by the Company; potential industry
consolidation and alliance changes; competition with reorganized carriers; low
fare levels by historical standards and the Company’s reduced pricing power;
changes in the Company’s corporate or business strategy; government regulation
of the Company’s business; conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks;
uncertainties with respect to the Company’s international operations; outbreaks
of a disease (such as SARS, avian flu or the H1N1 virus) that affects travel
behavior; labor costs that are higher than those of the Company’s competitors;
uncertainties with respect to the Company’s relationships with unionized and
other employee work groups; increased insurance costs and potential reductions
of available insurance coverage; the Company’s ability to retain key management
personnel; potential failures or disruptions of the Company’s computer,
communications or other technology systems; losses and adverse publicity
resulting from any accident involving the Company’s aircraft; changes in the
price of the Company’s common stock; and the ability of the Company to reach
acceptable agreements with third parties.  Additional information
concerning these and other factors is contained in the Company’s Securities and
Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to the Company’s 2008
Form 10-K, as updated by the Form 8-K and Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.



 



 






 



Overview


The
Company recorded a net loss of $390 million in the second quarter of 2009
compared to a net loss of $1.5 billion in the same period last year (second
quarter 2008 results include the $1.1 billion impact of the write down of the
McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and Embraer RJ-135 fleets and certain related long-lived
assets to their estimated fair values due to capacity reductions made in
response to unprecedentedly high fuel expenses).  The Company’s second
quarter 2009 loss is primarily attributable to a significant decrease in
passenger revenue due to lower traffic and passenger yield.  The
Company is experiencing significantly weaker
demand for air travel driven by the continuing severe downturn in the global
economy.  Mainline passenger revenue decreased by $1.1 billion
to $3.7 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same
period last year.  Mainline passenger unit revenues decreased 16.0
percent for the second quarter due to a 15.4 percent decrease in passenger yield
(passenger revenue per passenger mile) compared to the same period in 2008 and a
load factor decrease of approximately one point.




In
addition, during the second quarter of 2009, there was an outbreak of the H1N1
Influenza virus which had an estimated $50 to $80 million adverse revenue impact
throughout the Company’s network, but primarily on operations to and from
Mexico.  As a part of the second quarter 2009 net loss, the Company
also incurred approximately $70 million in non-recurring charges related to the
sale of certain aircraft and the grounding of leased Airbus A300 aircraft prior
to lease expiration.


The Company implemented capacity reductions in 2008 and
in the first quarter of 2009 in response to record high fuel
prices.  These capacity reductions have somewhat mitigated the
weakening of demand and in June 2009, the Company announced additional
capacity reductions in a further effort to balance supply and
demand.  AMR will reduce mainline seating capacity by approximately
7.5 percent for the full year 2009 versus 2008.  The reduction
consists of an approximately 9.0 percent reduction in mainline domestic capacity
and more than 4.0 percent reduction in mainline international capacity compared
to the year ending December 31, 2008.  As a result, for the quarter
ending September 30, 2009, AMR expects mainline domestic capacity to decline by
approximately 10.5 percent and mainline international capacity to decline by 6.0
percent compared to the quarter ending September 30, 2008.  No
assurance can be given that any capacity reductions or other steps the Company
may take will be adequate to offset the effects of reduced
demand.


The
decrease in total passenger revenue was partially offset by significantly lower
year over year fuel prices; the Company paid an average of $1.90 per gallon in
the second quarter 2009 compared to an average of $3.19 per gallon in the same
period of 2008, including effects of hedging.

The
Company’s unit costs excluding fuel and special charges were greater for the
quarter ended June 30, 2009 than for the same period in 2008, and are expected
to be higher for each period for the remainder of 2009 compared to the
corresponding prior year period.  Factors driving the increase include
increased defined benefit pension expenses (due to the stock market decline in
2008) and retiree medical and other expenses, and cost pressures associated with
the Company’s previously announced capacity reductions and dependability
initiatives.

In
reaction to these challenges, the Company has continued to work to implement and
maintain several key actions designed to help it manage through these near term
challenges while seeking to position itself for long-term success, including the
range of service charges introduced in 2008 to generate additional revenue,
execution of its fleet renewal and replacement plan, initiatives to improve
dependability and on-time performance, and an initiative to strengthen its
global network through the application pending with the U.S. Department of
Transportation for global antitrust immunity with four members of the oneworld global
alliance.



 



 





 

The Company’s ability to
become profitable and its ability to continue to fund its obligations on an
ongoing basis will depend on a number of factors, many of which are largely
beyond the Company’s control.  Certain risk factors that affect
the Company’s business and financial results are discussed in the Risk Factors
listed in Item 1A in the 2008 Form 10-K and as amended in Item 1A in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30,
2009.  In addition, most of the Company’s largest domestic
competitors and several smaller carriers have filed for bankruptcy in the last
several years and have used this process to significantly reduce contractual
labor and other costs.  In order to remain competitive and to improve
its financial condition, the Company must continue to take steps to generate
additional revenues and to reduce its costs.  Although the Company has
a number of initiatives underway to address its cost and revenue challenges,
some of these initiatives involve changes to the Company’s business which it may
be unable to implement.  In addition, the Company expects that, as
time goes on, it will be progressively more difficult to identify and implement
significant revenue enhancement and cost savings initiatives.  The
adequacy and ultimate success of the Company’s initiatives to generate
additional revenues and reduce costs are not known at this time and cannot be
assured. Moreover, whether the Company’s initiatives will be adequate or
successful depends in large measure on factors beyond its control, notably the
overall industry environment, including passenger demand, yield and industry
capacity growth, and fuel prices. It will be very difficult for the Company to
continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis, and to return to
profitability, if the overall industry revenue environment does not improve
substantially or if fuel prices were to increase and persist for an extended
period at high levels.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Significant Indebtedness and
Future Financing

The Company remains
heavily indebted and has significant obligations (including substantial pension
funding obligations), as described more fully under Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in
the Form 8-K. Indebtedness
is a significant risk to the Company as discussed in the Risk Factors listed in
Item 1A in the 2008 Form 10-K and as amended in Item 1A in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.  During 2006, 2007,
2008 and 2009 (through the date of this filing), the Company raised an aggregate
of approximately $3.4 billion in financing to fund capital commitments (mainly
for aircraft and ground properties), debt maturities, and employee pension
obligations, and to bolster its liquidity.  As of the date of this
Form 10-Q, although the Company believes it can access sufficient
liquidity to fund its operations and obligations for the remainder of 2009,
including repayment of debt and capital leases, capital expenditures and other
contractual obligations, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able
to do so.  To meet the Company’s
commitments, to maintain sufficient liquidity and because the Company has
significant debt, lease and other obligations in the next several years,
including commitments to purchase aircraft, as well as substantial pension
funding obligations (refer to Contractual Obligations in Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” in the Form 8-K), the Company will need
access to substantial additional funding.  

As of
June 30, 2009, the Company is required to make scheduled principal payments of
approximately $779 million on long-term debt and approximately $85 million in
payments on capital leases, and the Company expects to spend approximately $1.0
billion on capital expenditures for the remainder of 2009.  In
addition, the global economic downturn, potential increases in the amount of
required reserves under credit card processing agreements, and the obligation to
post cash collateral on fuel hedging contracts have negatively impacted, and may
in the future negatively impact, the Company’s liquidity.

Despite
the current disruptions in the capital markets, in the six months ended June 30,
2009, the Company obtained an aggregate of approximately $470 million of
financing under loans secured by various aircraft and sale leaseback financings
of certain aircraft



 



 






 



The
Company’s possible financing sources primarily include: (i) a limited amount of
additional secured aircraft debt or sale leaseback transactions involving owned
aircraft; (ii) leases of or debt secured by new aircraft deliveries; (iii) debt
secured by other assets; (iv) securitization of future operating receipts; (v)
the sale or monetization of certain assets; (vi) unsecured debt; and (vii)
issuance of equity and/or equity-like securities. Besides unencumbered aircraft,
the Company’s most likely sources of liquidity include the financing of
AAdvantage program miles and takeoff and landing slots, and the sale or
financing of certain of the Company’s business units and subsidiaries, such as
AMR Eagle.  The Company’s ability to obtain future financing is
limited by the value of its unencumbered assets.  A very large
majority of the Company’s aircraft assets (including most of the aircraft
eligible for the benefits of Section 1110 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) are
encumbered.  Also, the market value of these aircraft assets has
declined in recent years, and may continue to decline.  The Company
believes it has at least $3.7 billion in unencumbered assets and other sources
of liquidity as the date of this filing. However, the
availability and level of the financing sources described above cannot be
assured, particularly in light of the Company’s and American’s financial results
in recent years, the Company’s and American’s substantial indebtedness, the
difficult revenue environment they face, their reduced credit ratings, recent
historically high fuel prices, and the financial difficulties experienced in the
airline industry.  In addition, the global economic downturn and
recent severe disruptions in the capital markets and other sources of funding have resulted in greater
volatility, less liquidity, widening of credit spreads and substantially more
limited availability of funding.  The inability of the Company to
obtain necessary additional funding on acceptable terms would have a material
adverse impact on the Company and on its ability to sustain its
operations.

The
Company’s substantial indebtedness and other obligations have important
consequences.  For example, they: (i) limit the Company’s ability to
obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on
which such funding could be obtained; (ii) require the Company to dedicate a
substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its
indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for
other purposes; (iii) make the Company more vulnerable to economic downturns;
and (iv) limit the Company’s ability to withstand competitive pressures and
reduce its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic
conditions.

In June 2009, American entered into an
amendment to a purchase agreement with Boeing.  Pursuant to the
amendment, American exercised rights to purchase an additional eight 737-800
aircraft and the delivery dates of certain
aircraft were rescheduled.  As a result, American’s total 737-800 purchase
commitments for 2009 (including nine aircraft that have been delivered as of
June 30, 2009) have increased from 29 as of March 31, 2009 to 31 as of June 30, 2009, and American’s
737-800 purchase commitments for 2010 have increased from 39 as of March 31,
2009 to 45 as of June 30, 2009.  American’s 737-800 purchase
commitments remain at eight in 2011.  In addition to these aircraft,
American has firm commitments for eleven 737-800 aircraft and seven Boeing 777
aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2013-2016.

As of
June 30, 2009, payments for American’s 737-800 and 777 aircraft purchase
commitments will approximate $716 million for the remainder of 2009, $1.3
billion in 2010, $354 million in 2011, $217 million in 2012, $399 million in
2013, and $556 million for 2014 and beyond. These amounts are net of purchase
deposits currently held by the manufacturer.

American
previously arranged backstop financing which, together with other financing arranged through the date
of this filing, including the pass through certificate financing referred
to in the following paragraph, covers all of its 2009-2011 Boeing 737-800
aircraft deliveries, subject to certain terms and conditions (including, in the
case of one of the financing arrangements covering twelve aircraft, a condition
that at the time of borrowing, the Company has a certain amount of unrestricted
cash and short term investments).

As more
fully described in Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, on
July 7, 2009, American obtained financing for four Boeing 777-200ER aircraft
owned by American and 16 Boeing 737-800 aircraft to be delivered to American
through the issuance of the Certificates which raised $520
million.  The Certificates bear interest at 10.375% per
annum.  A majority of the proceeds were placed in
escrow.  As American takes delivery of each Boeing 737-800 aircraft it
finances under this arrangement, American will issue equipment notes secured by
such aircraft to the trust, which will purchase such notes with an allocable
portion of the escrowed funds.  American will use such funds to
finance the purchase of the aircraft and the Company will record the principal
amount of such equipment notes as debt on its consolidated balance
sheet.

The
Company’s continued aircraft replacement strategy, and its execution of that
strategy, will depend on such factors as future economic and industry conditions
and the financial condition of the Company.



 



 






 



Credit Facility
Covenants

American
has a secured $433 million term loan credit facility with a final maturity on
December 17, 2010. American’s obligations under the Credit
Facility are guaranteed by AMR.  The Credit Facility contains a
covenant (the Liquidity Covenant) requiring American to maintain, as defined,
unrestricted cash, unencumbered short term investments and amounts available for
drawing under committed revolving credit facilities of not less than $1.25
billion for each quarterly period through the life of the Credit
Facility.  AMR and American were in compliance with the Liquidity
Covenant as of June 30, 2009.  In addition, the Credit Facility
contains a covenant (the EBITDAR Covenant) requiring AMR to maintain a ratio of
cash flow (defined as consolidated net income, before interest expense (less
capitalized interest), income taxes, depreciation and amortization and rentals,
adjusted for certain gains or losses and non-cash items) to fixed charges
(comprising interest expense (less capitalized interest) and
rentals).  In June 2009, AMR and American entered into an amendment to
the Credit Facility which waived compliance with the EBITDAR Covenant for the
quarter ended June 30, 2009; however, even absent this waiver the Company would
have complied with this covenant as of June 30, 2009.  In addition,
the amendment reduced the minimum ratios AMR is required to satisfy to 0.95 to
1.00 for the one, two and three quarter periods ending September 30, 2009,
December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010, respectively, to 1.00 to 1.00 for the four
quarter period ending June 30, 2010, and to 1.05 to 1.00 for the four quarter
period ending September 30, 2010.

Given the
volatility of fuel prices and revenues, uncertainty in the capital markets and
uncertainty about other sources of funding, and other factors, it is difficult
to assess whether the Company will be able to continue to comply with the
Liquidity Covenant and the EBITDAR Covenant, and there are no assurances that it
will be able to do so.  Failure to comply with these covenants would
result in a default under the Credit Facility which — if the Company did not
take steps to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate, the default — could
result in a default under a significant amount of its other debt and lease
obligations, and otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company and its
ability to sustain its operations.

Credit Card Processing and
Other Reserves

American
has agreements with a number of credit card companies and processors to accept
credit cards for the sale of air travel and other services.  Under
certain of American’s current credit card processing agreements, the related
credit card company or processor may hold back, under certain circumstances, a
reserve from American’s credit card receivables.

Under one
such agreement, which was recently amended, the amount of such reserve generally
is based on the amount of unrestricted cash (not including undrawn credit
facilities) held by the Company and the processor’s exposure to the Company
under the agreement.  Given the volatility of fuel prices and
revenues, uncertainty in the capital markets and uncertainty about other sources
of funding, and other factors, it is difficult to forecast the required amount
of such reserve at any time.  The amount of the reserve was $154
million as of June 30, 2009.  The agreement limits the maximum amount
of the reserve (determined as described above) during the period ending February
15, 2010, and the Company currently estimates such maximum amount during that
period to be approximately $300 million.  However, if current
conditions persist, absent a waiver or modification of the agreement, such
required amount could be substantially greater after such period.

Pension Funding
Obligation

The
Company is required to make minimum contributions to its defined benefit pension
plans under the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA), the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004 and the Pension
Protection Act of 2006. The Company is not required to make any 2009
contributions to its defined benefit pension plans under the provisions of these
acts.

Although
the Company is not required to make contributions to its defined benefit pension
plans in 2009, based on current funding levels of the plans, the Company expects
that the amount of the required contributions will be substantial in 2010 and
future years.  The Company expects to contribute approximately $13
million to its retiree medical and other benefit plan in 2009.
 


 



 






 



Cash Flow
Activity

At June 30, 2009, the
Company had $2.8 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments,
reflecting a decrease of $299 million from the balance of $3.1 billion at
December 31, 2008.  Net cash provided by operating activities
in the six-month period ended June 30, 2009 was $938 million, a decrease of $216
million over the same period in 2008.  The decline in unrestricted
cash and short-term investments is primarily due to the significant decline in
the demand for air travel, which resulted in a 22.7 percent decrease in
passenger revenue, and principal payments made during the first six months of
2009.  The impact of these two factors was somewhat offset by the
year-over-year decrease in fuel prices from $2.97 per gallon for the first six
months of 2008 to $1.90 per gallon for the same period in 2009.  The
fuel price decrease resulted in $1.5 billion in decremental year-over-year
expense in the six months ended June 30, 2009 (based on the year-over-year
decrease in the average price per gallon multiplied by gallons
consumed).

The
Company made scheduled debt and capital lease payments of $1.2 billion in the
first six months of 2009.  Included in this amount, AMR retired, by
purchasing with cash, the $318 million principal amount of its 4.50
Notes.  Virtually all of the holders of the 4.50 Notes exercised their
elective put rights and the Company purchased and retired these notes at a price
equal to 100 percent of their principal amount.  Under the terms of
the 4.50 Notes, the Company had the option to pay the purchase price with cash,
stock, or a combination of cash and stock, and the Company elected to pay for
the 4.50 Notes solely with cash.  Also included in total scheduled
debt payments, the Company retired, at maturity, its $255 million secured bank
revolving credit facility in June 2009.

Despite
the current disruptions in the capital markets, in the six months ended June 30,
2009, the Company obtained an aggregate of approximately $470 million of
financing under loans secured by various aircraft and sale leaseback financings
of certain aircraft.

Capital
expenditures for the first six months of 2009 were $602 million and primarily
consisted of new aircraft and certain aircraft modifications.

Due to
the current value of the Company’s derivative contracts, some agreements with
counterparties require collateral to be deposited by the Company.  As
of June 30, 2009, the cash collateral held by such counterparties from AMR was
$59 million.  The amount of collateral required to be deposited with
the Company or with the counterparty by the Company is based on fuel price in
relation to the market values of the derivative contracts and collateral
provisions per the terms of those contracts and can fluctuate
significantly.  The Company was over-collateralized as of June 30,
2009 due to a timing lag in collateral reconciliation with a certain
counterparty.  The Company is currently required to collateralize
approximately 100 percent of the outstanding liability hedge
contracts.  As such, when these contracts settle, the collateral
posted with counterparties will effectively offset the loss position and minimal
further cash impact will be recorded assuming a static forward heating oil curve
from June 30, 2009.  Under the same assumption, the Company does not
currently expect to be required to deposit significant additional cash
collateral above June 30, 2009 levels with counterparties with regard to fuel
hedges in place as of June 30, 2009.  Additional information regarding
the Company’s fuel hedging program is also included in Item 3 “Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and in Note 9 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements.

War-Risk
Insurance

The U.S.
government has agreed to provide commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based
airlines until September 30, 2009, covering losses to employees, passengers,
third parties and aircraft.  If the U.S. government does not extend
the policy beyond that date, or if the U.S. government at anytime thereafter
ceases to provide such insurance, or reduces the coverage provided by such
insurance, the Company will attempt to purchase similar coverage with narrower
scope from commercial insurers at an additional cost. To the extent this
coverage is not available at commercially reasonable rates, the Company would be
adversely affected. While the price of commercial insurance has declined since
the premium increases immediately after terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,
in the event commercial insurance carriers further reduce the amount of
insurance coverage available to the Company, or significantly increase its cost,
the Company would be adversely affected.


 



 






 



RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

For the Three Months Ended
June 30, 2009 and 2008

Revenues

The
Company’s revenues decreased approximately $1.3 billion, or 20.9 percent, to
$4.9 billion in the second quarter of 2009 from the same period last
year.  American’s passenger revenues decreased by 22.3 percent, or
$1.1 billion, on a 7.6 percent decrease in capacity (available seat mile)
(ASM).  American’s passenger load factor decreased by approximately
one point to 81.8 percent while passenger yield decreased by 15.4 percent to
11.65 cents.  This resulted in a decrease in passenger revenue per
available seat mile (RASM) of 16.0 percent to 9.53 cents. Following is
additional information regarding American’s domestic and international RASM and
capacity:

The
Company’s Regional Affiliates include two wholly owned subsidiaries, American
Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. (collectively, AMR Eagle), and
an independent carrier with which American has a capacity purchase agreement,
Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua).

Regional
Affiliates’ passenger revenues, which are based on industry standard proration
agreements for flights connecting to American flights, decreased $170 million,
or 24.9 percent, to $513 million as a result of a reduction in capacity,
decreased passenger traffic and lower yield.  Regional Affiliates’ traffic
decreased 9.1 percent to 2.2 billion revenue passenger miles (RPMs), on a
capacity decrease of 10.8 percent to 2.9 billion ASMs, resulting in a 1.4 point
increase in the passenger load factor to 74.7 percent. 

Cargo
revenues decreased by 42.5 percent, or $99 million, primarily due to decreases
in advertising mail and freight traffic resulting from the current economic
downturn.

Other
revenues increased 7.0 percent, or $37 million, to $565 million due to increases
in certain passenger service charges.




 



 






 



Operating
Expenses

The
Company’s total operating expenses decreased 31.5 percent, or $2.4 billion, to
$5.1 billion in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of
2008.  The Company’s operating expenses per ASM in the second quarter
of 2009 decreased 25.7 percent to 12.33 cents compared to the second quarter of
2008. These decreases are largely due to an impairment charge of $1.1 billion to
write the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and Embraer RJ-135 fleets and certain related
long-lived assets down to their estimated fair values in 2008, and to decreased
fuel prices in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of
2008.  These decreases were somewhat offset by increased defined
benefit pension expenses and retiree medical and other expenses (due to the
stock market decline in 2008), and by cost pressures associated with the
Company’s previously announced capacity reductions and dependability
initiatives.

(a)  


Aircraft
      fuel expense decreased primarily due to a 40.6 percent decrease in the
      Company’s price per gallon of fuel (net of the impact of fuel hedging) and
      a 7.4 percent decrease in the Company’s fuel consumption.  The
      Company recorded $197 million in net losses and $340 million in net gains
      on its fuel hedging contracts for the three months ended June 30, 2009 and
      June 30, 2008, respectively.









(b)  


Depreciation
      and amortization expense decreased due to impairment charge in
      2008.









(c)  


Commissions,
      booking fees and credit card expense decreased in conjunction with the
      20.9 percent decrease in the Company’s
revenue.









(d)  


Special
      charges in 2008 are related to impairment charge of $1.1 billion to write
      down the Company’s McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and Embraer RJ-135 fleets and
      certain related long-lived assets to their estimated fair
      values.





Other
Income (Expense)

Interest
income decreased $39 million due to both a decrease in short-term investment
balances and a decrease in interest rates.  Interest expense decreased
$32 million as a result of a decrease in the Company’s long-term debt balance
and lower variable interest rates.






Income
      Tax






The
Company did not record a net tax provision (benefit) associated with its second
quarter 2009 or second quarter 2008 losses due to the Company providing a
valuation allowance, as discussed in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated
financial statements.

Company’s revenues decreased approximately $2.1 billion, or 18.1 percent, to
$9.7 billion in the second quarter of 2009 from the same period last
year.  American’s passenger revenues decreased by 19.3 percent, or
$1.8 billion, on a 7.8 percent decrease in capacity (available seat mile)
(ASM).  American’s passenger load factor decreased 2.0 points to 78.8
percent while passenger yield decreased by 10.3 percent to 12.23
cents.  This resulted in a decrease in passenger revenue per available
seat mile (RASM) of 12.5 percent to 9.64 cents. Following is additional
information regarding American’s domestic and international RASM and
capacity:

The
Company’s Regional Affiliates include two wholly owned subsidiaries, American
Eagle Airlines, Inc. and Executive Airlines, Inc. (collectively, AMR Eagle), and
an independent carrier with which American has a capacity purchase agreement,
Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua).

Regional
Affiliates’ passenger revenues, which are based on industry standard proration
agreements for flights connecting to American flights, decreased $294 million,
or 23.3 percent, to $970 million as a result of a reduction in capacity,
decreased passenger traffic and lower yield.  Regional Affiliates’ traffic
decreased 11.0 percent to 4.0 billion revenue passenger miles (RPMs), on a
capacity decrease of 10.0 percent to 5.7 billion ASMs, resulting in an
approximately one point decrease in the passenger load factor to 70.4
percent. 

Cargo
revenues decreased by 37.9 percent, or $170 million, primarily due to decreases
in advertising mail and freight traffic resulting from the current economic
downturn.

Other
revenues increased 7.0 percent, or $73 million, to $1.1 billion due to increases
in certain passenger service charges.




 



 






 




Operating
Expenses

The
Company’s total operating expenses decreased 24.0 percent, or $3.2 billion, to
$10.1 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to the same period
in 2008.  The Company’s operating expenses per ASM decreased 17.5
percent to 12.36 cents compared to 2008. These decreases are due primarily to
decreased fuel prices in the first half of 2009 compared to the first half of
2008.  The decreases were somewhat offset by increased defined benefit
pension expenses and retiree medical and other expenses (due to the stock market
decline in 2008), and by cost pressures associated with the Company’s previously
announced capacity reductions and dependability initiatives.

      Company’s price per gallon of fuel (net of the impact of fuel hedging) and
      an 8.3 percent decrease in the Company’s fuel consumption. The Company
      recorded $465 million in net losses and $447 million in net gains on its
      fuel hedging contracts for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30,
      2008, respectively.

      down the Company’s McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and Embraer RJ-135 fleets and
      certain related long-lived assets to their estimated fair
      values.










Other
      Income (Expense)






Interest
income decreased $81 million due to both a decrease in short-term investment
balances and a decrease in interest rates.  Interest expense decreased
$52 million as a result of a decrease in the Company’s long-term debt balance
and lower variable interest rates.






Income
      Tax






The
Company did not record a net tax provision (benefit) associated with its loss
for the six months ended June 30, 2009 or June 30, 2008 due to the Company
providing a valuation allowance, as discussed in Note 4 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements.

Outlook






The
Company currently expects capacity for American’s mainline jet operations to
decline by approximately 8.5 percent in the third quarter of 2009
versus the third quarter of 2008.  American’s mainline capacity for the
full year 2009 is expected to decrease approximately 7.5 percent from 2008 with
approximately a 9.0 percent reduction in domestic capacity and more than a 4.0
percent decrease in international capacity. 

The
Company currently expects third quarter 2009 mainline unit costs to decrease
approximately 14.3 percent year over year primarily due to historically high
fuel costs recorded in the third quarter 2008, somewhat offset by increased
defined benefit pension expenses (due to the stock market decline in 2008) and
retiree medical and other benefit expenses, and by cost pressures associated
with the Company’s previously announced capacity reductions and dependability
initiatives.  Due to these cost pressures, the Company expects third
quarter and full year 2009 unit costs excluding fuel to be higher than the
respective prior year periods.  The Company’s results are
significantly affected by the price of jet fuel, which is in turn affected by a
number of factors beyond the Company’s control.  Although fuel prices
have abated somewhat from the record prices recorded in July 2008, fuel prices
have increased since the first quarter of 2009 and they remain high and very
volatile.

The
Company is experiencing significantly weaker
demand for air travel driven by the severe downturn in the global
economy.  The Company implemented capacity reductions in 2008 and in
the first quarter of 2009 in response to record high fuel
prices.  Those capacity reductions have somewhat mitigated this
weakening of demand, and in June 2009, the Company announced additional capacity
reductions in a further effort to balance supply and demand.  However,
if the global economic downturn persists or worsens, demand for air travel may
continue to weaken.  No assurance can be given that capacity
reductions or other steps the Company may take will be adequate to offset the
effects of reduced demand.  In addition, fare discounting has recently
been both broader and deeper than usual, and the Company expects downward
pressure on passenger yields into the third quarter.



 



 






 



Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates

The
preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes.  The Company believes its estimates
and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results and the timing of the
recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates.  The
Company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates
used by management in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements:
accounting for fair value, long-lived assets, routes, passenger revenue,
frequent flyer program, stock compensation, pensions and retiree medical and
other benefits, income taxes and derivatives accounting.  These
policies and estimates are described in the Form 8-K except as updated
below.

Routes -- AMR performs annual
impairment tests on its routes, which are indefinite life intangible assets
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 "Goodwill and Other
Intangibles" and as a result they are not amortized. The Company also performs
impairment tests when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be
impaired.  These tests are primarily based on estimates of discounted
future cash flows, using assumptions based on historical results adjusted to
reflect the Company’s best estimate of future market and operating
conditions.   The net carrying value of assets not recoverable is
reduced to fair value. The Company's estimates of fair value represent its best
estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and
transactions.  Renewal and extension costs for the Company’s
intangible assets are minimal and are expensed as incurred.

In
September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS
157).  SFAS 157 introduces a framework for measuring fair value and
expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and
liabilities.  SFAS 157-2, applicable to non-financial assets and
liabilities, is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008,
and the Company has adopted the standard for those assets and liabilities as of
January 1, 2009.  Annual impairment testing on the Company’s routes
will occur in the fourth quarter of 2009, at which time the net carrying value
of the routes will be reassessed for recoverability.  If it at that
time, the fair value of the routes is less than the carrying value, the Company
will adjust the value of the route assets and apply SFAS 157-2 provisions to its
routes.

The   Company   had   recorded  route  acquisition  costs   (including
international routes and slots) of $831 million as of June 30, 2009,
including  a  significant  amount  related  to  operations  at  London
Heathrow.  The Company has completed an impairment analysis on the
London Heathrow routes (including slots) as of December 2008, resulting in no
impairment.  However, given the significant uncertainty regarding the
long term impact of open skies, ultimate depth of the economic recession and how
these events ultimately affect the Company’s operations at Heathrow, the actual
results could differ from those estimates.



 



 






 



Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk

There
have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in
Item 7A. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of the Form
8-K.  The change in market risk for aircraft fuel is discussed below
for informational purposes.

The risk
inherent in the Company’s fuel related market risk sensitive instruments and
positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of
fuel.  The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects
that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they
consider additional actions management may take to mitigate the Company’s
exposure to such changes.  Therefore, actual results may
differ.  The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes.

Aircraft
Fuel   The Company’s earnings are affected by changes in
the price and availability of aircraft fuel.  In order to provide a
measure of control over price and supply, the Company trades and ships fuel and
maintains fuel storage facilities to support its flight
operations.  The Company also manages the price risk of fuel costs
primarily by using jet fuel and heating oil hedging contracts.  Market
risk is estimated as a hypothetical ten percent increase in the June 30, 2009
cost per gallon of fuel.  Based on projected 2009 and 2010 fuel usage
through June 30, 2010, such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft
fuel expense of approximately $441 million in the twelve months ended June 30,
2010, inclusive of the impact of effective fuel hedge instruments outstanding at
June 30, 2009, and assumes the Company’s fuel hedging program remains effective
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”.  Comparatively, based
on projected 2009 fuel usage, such an increase would have resulted in an
increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $399 million in the twelve
months ended December 31, 2008, inclusive of the impact of fuel hedge
instruments outstanding at December 31, 2008.  The change in market
risk is primarily due to the decrease in fuel prices.

Ineffectiveness
is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in crude oil or
other crude oil related commodities.  As required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133), the Company assesses, both at the inception
of each hedge and on an on-going basis, whether the derivatives that are used in
its hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash
flows of the hedged items.  In doing so, the Company uses a regression
model to determine the correlation of the change in prices of the commodities
used to hedge jet fuel (e.g. NYMEX Heating oil) to the change in the price of
jet fuel.  The Company also monitors the actual dollar offset of the
hedges’ market values as compared to hypothetical jet fuel
hedges.  The fuel hedge contracts are generally deemed to be “highly
effective” if the R-squared is greater than 80 percent and the dollar offset
correlation is within 80 percent to 125 percent.  The Company
discontinues hedge accounting prospectively if it determines that a derivative
is no longer expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if it decides to
discontinue the hedging relationship.

As of
June 30, 2009, the Company had cash flow hedges, with collars and options,
covering approximately 32 percent of its estimated remaining 2009 fuel
requirements.  The consumption hedged for the remainder of 2009 is
capped at an average price of approximately $2.49 per gallon of jet fuel, and
the Company’s collars have an average floor price of approximately $1.80 per
gallon of jet fuel (both the capped and floor price exclude taxes and
transportation costs).  The Company’s collars represent approximately
28 percent of its estimated remaining 2009 fuel requirements.  A
deterioration of the Company’s financial position could negatively affect the
Company’s ability to hedge fuel in the future.



 



 






 



Item
4.  Controls and
Procedures

The term
“disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. This term refers to
the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. An
evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief
Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2008.  Based on that
evaluation, the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that
the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30,
2009. During the quarter ending on June 30, 2009, there was no change in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.



 



 






 



PART
II:  OTHER INFORMATION

Item
1.  Legal
Proceedings

Between
April 3, 2003 and June 5, 2003, three lawsuits were filed by travel agents, some
of whom opted out of a prior class action (now dismissed) to pursue their claims
individually against American, other airline defendants, and in one case,
against certain airline defendants and Orbitz LLC.  The cases, Tam Travel et. al., v. Delta
Air Lines et. al., in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California, San Francisco (51 individual agencies), Paula Fausky d/b/a Timeless
Travel v. American Airlines, et. al, in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division (29 agencies) and Swope Travel et al. v.
Orbitz et. al. in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas, Beaumont Division (71 agencies) were consolidated for
pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Ohio, Eastern Division.  Collectively, these lawsuits seek damages and
injunctive relief alleging that the certain airline defendants and Orbitz LLC:
(i) conspired to prevent travel agents from acting as effective competitors in
the distribution of airline tickets to passengers in violation of Section 1 of
the Sherman Act;  (ii) conspired to monopolize the distribution of common
carrier air travel between airports in the United States in violation of Section
2 of the Sherman Act; and that (iii) between 1995 and the present, the airline
defendants conspired to reduce commissions paid to U.S.-based travel agents in
violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.  On September 23, 2005, the
Fausky
plaintiffs dismissed their claims with prejudice.  On September 14, 2006,
the court dismissed with prejudice 28 of the Swope
plaintiffs.  On October 29, 2007, the court dismissed all
actions.  The Tam plaintiffs have
appealed the court’s decision.  The Swope plaintiffs have
moved to have their case remanded to the Eastern District of Texas.
 American continues to vigorously defend these lawsuits.  A final
adverse court decision awarding substantial money damages or placing material
restrictions on the Company’s distribution practices would have a material
adverse impact on the Company.

On July
12, 2004, a consolidated class action complaint that was subsequently amended on
November 30, 2004, was filed against American and the Association of
Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), the union which represents American’s
flight attendants (Ann
M. Marcoux, et al., v. American Airlines Inc., et al. in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of New York). While a class has
not yet been certified, the lawsuit seeks on behalf of all of American’s flight
attendants or various subclasses to set aside and to obtain damages allegedly
resulting from the April 2003 Collective Bargaining Agreement referred to as the
Restructuring Participation Agreement (RPA). The RPA was one of three labor
agreements American successfully reached with its unions in order to avoid
filing for bankruptcy in 2003.  In a related case (Sherry Cooper, et al. v.
TWA Airlines, LLC, et al., also in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of New York), the court denied a preliminary injunction
against implementation of the RPA on June 30, 2003. The Marcoux suit alleges
various claims against the APFA and American relating to the RPA and the
ratification vote on the RPA by individual APFA members, including: violation of
the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) and the APFA’s
Constitution and By-laws, violation by the APFA of its duty of fair
representation to its members, violation by American of provisions of the
Railway Labor Act (RLA) through improper coercion of flight attendants into
voting or changing their vote for ratification, and violations of the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO). On
March 28, 2006, the district court dismissed all of various state law claims
against American, all but one of the LMRDA claims against the APFA, and the
claimed violations of RICO.  On July 22, 2008, the district court
granted summary judgment to American and APFA concerning the remaining claimed
violations of the RLA and the duty of fair representation against American and
the APFA (as well as one LMRDA claim and one claim against the APFA of a breach
of its constitution).  On August 20, 2008, a notice of appeal was
filed on behalf of the purported class of flight attendants. Although the
Company believes the case against it is without merit and both American and the
APFA are vigorously defending the lawsuit, a final adverse court decision
invalidating the RPA and awarding substantial money damages would have a
material adverse impact on the Company.



 



 






 



On
February 14, 2006, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice (the “DOJ”) served the Company with a grand jury subpoena as part of an
ongoing investigation into possible criminal violations of the antitrust laws by
certain domestic and foreign air cargo carriers. At this time, the Company does
not believe it is a target of the DOJ investigation.  The New Zealand
Commerce Commission notified the Company on February 17, 2006 that it is also
investigating whether the Company and certain other cargo carriers entered into
agreements relating to fuel surcharges, security surcharges, war risk
surcharges, and customs clearance surcharges.  On February 22, 2006, the
Company received a letter from the Swiss Competition Commission informing the
Company that it too is investigating whether the Company and certain other cargo
carriers entered into agreements relating to fuel surcharges, security
surcharges, war risk surcharges, and customs clearance surcharges.  On
March 11, 2008, the Company received from the Swiss Competition Commission a
request for information concerning, among other things, the scope and
organization of the Company’s activities in Switzerland.  On December
19, 2006 and June 12, 2007, the Company received requests for information from
the European Commission seeking information regarding the Company's corporate
structure, and revenue and pricing announcements for air cargo shipments to and
from the European Union. On January 23, 2007, the Brazilian competition
authorities, as part of an ongoing investigation, conducted an unannounced
search of the Company’s cargo facilities in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  On
April 28, 2008, the Brazilian competition authorities preliminarily charged the
Company with violating Brazilian competition laws.  The authorities
are investigating whether the Company and certain other foreign and domestic air
carriers violated Brazilian competition laws by illegally conspiring to set fuel
surcharges on cargo shipments.  The Company is vigorously contesting
the allegations and the preliminary findings of the Brazilian competition
authorities.  On June 27, 2007 and October 31, 2007, the Company
received requests for information from the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission seeking information regarding fuel surcharges imposed by the Company
on cargo shipments to and from Australia and regarding the structure of the
Company's cargo operations. On September 1, 2008, the Company received a request
from the Korea Fair Trade Commission seeking information regarding cargo rates
and surcharges and the structure of the Company’s activities in Korea. On December 18, 2007, the
European Commission issued a Statement of Objection (“SO”) against 26 airlines,
including the Company.  The SO alleges that these carriers
participated in a conspiracy to set surcharges on cargo shipments in violation
of EU law.  The SO states that, in the event that the allegations in
the SO are affirmed, the Commission will impose fines against the
Company.  The Company intends to vigorously contest the allegations
and findings in the SO under EU laws, and it intends to cooperate fully with all
other pending investigations. In the event that the SO is affirmed or other
investigations uncover violations of the U.S. antitrust laws or the competition
laws of some other jurisdiction, or if the Company were named and found liable
in any litigation based on these allegations, such findings and related legal
proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the
Company.  

Forty-five
purported class action lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. against the Company
and certain foreign and domestic air carriers alleging that the defendants
violated U.S. antitrust laws by illegally conspiring to set prices and
surcharges on cargo shipments.  These cases, along with other
purported class action lawsuits in which the Company was not named, were
consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New
York as In re Air
Cargo Shipping Services Antitrust Litigation, 06-MD-1775 on June 20,
2006.  Plaintiffs are
seeking trebled money damages and injunctive relief.  The Company has
not been named as a defendant in the consolidated complaint filed by the
plaintiffs.  However, the plaintiffs have not released any claims that
they may have against the Company, and the Company may later be added as a
defendant in the litigation.  If the Company is sued on these claims,
it will vigorously defend the suit, but any adverse judgment could have a
material adverse impact on the Company.  Also, on January 23, 2007,
the Company was served with a purported class action complaint filed against the
Company, American, and certain foreign and domestic air carriers in the Supreme
Court of British Columbia in Canada (McKay v. Ace Aviation
Holdings, et al.). The plaintiff alleges that the defendants violated
Canadian competition laws by illegally conspiring to set prices and surcharges
on cargo shipments.  The complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages
under Canadian law.  On June 22, 2007, the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss
their claims against the Company.  The dismissal is without prejudice
and the Company could be brought back into the litigation at a future
date.  If litigation is recommenced against the Company in the
Canadian courts, the Company will vigorously defend itself; however, any adverse
judgment could have a material adverse impact on the Company.



 



 






 



On June
20, 2006, the DOJ served the Company with a grand jury subpoena as part of an
ongoing investigation into possible criminal violations of the antitrust laws by
certain domestic and foreign passenger carriers.  At this time, the
Company does not believe it is a target of the DOJ investigation.  The
Company intends to cooperate fully with this investigation.  On
September 4, 2007, the Attorney General of the State of Florida served the
Company with a Civil Investigative Demand as part of its investigation of
possible violations of federal and Florida antitrust laws regarding the pricing
of air passenger transportation.  In the event that this or other
investigations uncover violations of the U.S. antitrust laws or the competition
laws of some other jurisdiction, such findings and related legal proceedings
could have a material adverse impact on the Company.

Approximately
52 purported class action lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. against the
Company and certain foreign and domestic air carriers alleging that the
defendants violated U.S. antitrust laws by illegally conspiring to set prices
and surcharges for passenger transportation.  On October 25, 2006,
these cases, along with other purported class action lawsuits in which the
Company was not named, were consolidated in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of California as In re International Air
Transportation Surcharge Antitrust Litigation, Civ. No. 06-1793 (the
“Passenger MDL”).  On July 9, 2007, the Company was named as a
defendant in the Passenger MDL.  On August 25, 2008, the plaintiffs
dismissed their claims against the Company in this action.  On March
13, 2008, and March 14, 2008, two additional purported class action complaints,
Turner v. American Airlines, et al., Civ. No. 08-1444 (N.D. Cal.), and LaFlamme
v. American Airlines, et al., Civ. No. 08-1079 (E.D.N.Y.), were filed against
the Company, alleging that the Company violated U.S. antitrust laws by illegally
conspiring to set prices and surcharges for passenger transportation in Japan
and certain European countries, respectively.  The Turner plaintiffs
have failed to perfect service against the Company, and it is unclear whether
they intend to pursue their claims.  On February 17, 2009, the LaFlamme
plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their claims against the Company without
prejudice.  In the event that the Turner plaintiffs pursue their claims or
the LaFlamme plaintiffs re-file claims against the Company, the Company will
vigorously defend these lawsuits, but any adverse judgment in these actions
could have a material adverse impact on the Company.

On August
21, 2006, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed against American and American
Beacon Advisors, Inc. (then a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Ronald A. Katz Technology
Licensing, L.P. v. American Airlines, Inc., et al.).  This case
has been consolidated in the Central District of California for pre-trial
purposes with numerous other cases brought by the plaintiff against other
defendants.    The plaintiff alleges that American infringes
a number of the plaintiff’s patents, each of which relates to automated
telephone call processing systems.  The plaintiff is seeking past and
future royalties, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees.  On
December 1, 2008, the court dismissed with prejudice all claims against American
Beacon.  On May 22, 2009, following its granting of summary judgment
to American based on invalidity and non-infringement, the court dismissed all
claims against American.  Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on June
22, 2009 with respect to the court’s ruling for American.  Although
the Company believes that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit and is
vigorously defending the lawsuit, a final adverse court decision awarding
substantial money damages or placing material restrictions on existing automated
telephone call system operations would have a material adverse impact on the
Company.


 



 






 



Item
1A.  Risk Factors 

As a result of significant losses in
recent years, our financial condition has been materially
weakened.

We
incurred significant losses in 2001-2005, which materially weakened our
financial condition. We lost $893 million in 2005, $781 million in
2004, $1.2 billion in 2003, $3.5 billion in 2002 and $1.8 billion
in 2001.  Although we earned a profit of $456 million in 2007 and
$189 million in 2006, we lost $2.1 billion in 2008 (which included a
$1.1 billion impairment charge), and $765 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2009.   Because of our weakened financial
condition, we are vulnerable both to the impact of unexpected events (such as
terrorist attacks or spikes in jet fuel prices) and to deterioration of the
operating environment (such as a deepening of the current global recession or
significant increased competition).

The severe global economic downturn
has resulted in weaker demand for air travel and lower investment asset returns,
which may have a significant negative impact on us.

We are
experiencing significantly weaker demand for air travel driven by the severe
downturn in the global economy.  Many of the countries we serve are
experiencing economic slowdowns or recessions.  We began to experience
weakening demand late in 2008, and this weakness has continued in
2009.  We reduced capacity in 2008, and in 2009 we have announced
additional reductions to our capacity plan for this year.  If the
global economic downturn persists or worsens, demand for air travel may continue
to weaken. No assurance can be given that capacity reductions or other steps we
may take will be adequate to offset the effects of reduced demand.

The
economic downturn has resulted in broadly lower investment asset returns and
values, and our pension assets suffered a material decrease in value in 2008
related to broader stock market declines, which will result in higher pension
expense in 2009 and future years and higher required contributions in future
years.  In addition, under these unfavorable economic conditions, the
amount of the cash reserves we are required to maintain under our credit card
processing agreements may increase substantially.  These issues
individually or collectively may have a material adverse impact on our
liquidity.  Also, disruptions in the capital markets and other sources
of funding may make it impossible for us to obtain necessary additional funding
or make the cost of that funding prohibitive.

We face numerous challenges as we
seek to maintain sufficient liquidity, and we will need to raise substantial
additional funds. We may not be able to raise those funds, or to do so on
acceptable terms.
     
We have
significant debt, lease and other obligations in the next several years,
including significant pension funding obligations.  For example, in
2009 we will be required to make approximately $2.0 billion of principal
payments on long term debt and payments on capital leases, and we expect to
make approximately $1.6 billion of capital expenditures.  In
addition, the global economic downturn, potential increases in the amount of
required reserves under credit card processing agreements, and the obligation to
post cash collateral on fuel hedging contracts have negatively impacted, and may
in the future negatively impact, our liquidity.  To meet our
commitments and to maintain sufficient liquidity as we continue to implement our
restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, we will need continued access to
substantial additional funding. Moreover, while we have arranged financings
that, subject to certain terms and conditions (including, in the case of one of
the financing arrangements covering twelve aircraft, a condition that, at the
time of borrowing, we have a certain amount of unrestricted cash and short term
investments), cover all of our 2009-2011 aircraft delivery commitments through
2011, we will also need to raise substantial additional funds to meet our
commitments to purchase aircraft and execute our fleet replacement
plan.

Our
ability to obtain future financing is limited by the value of our unencumbered
assets.  A very large majority of our aircraft assets (including most
of our aircraft eligible for the benefits of Section 1110) are
encumbered.  Also, the market value of our aircraft assets has
declined in recent years, and may continue to decline.
     
Since the
terrorist attacks of September 2001 (the “Terrorist Attacks”), our credit
ratings have been lowered to significantly below investment grade. These
reductions have increased our borrowing costs and otherwise adversely affected
borrowing terms, and limited borrowing options.  Additional reductions
in our credit ratings might have other effects on us, such as further increasing
borrowing or other costs or further restricting our ability to raise
funds.







A number
of other factors, including our financial results in recent years, our
substantial indebtedness, the difficult revenue environment we face, our reduced
credit ratings, recent historically high fuel prices, and the financial
difficulties experienced in the airline industry, adversely affect the
availability and terms of funding for us.  In addition, the global
economic downturn and recent severe disruptions in the capital markets and other
sources of funding have resulted in greater volatility, less liquidity, widening
of credit spreads, and substantially more limited availability of
funding.  As a result of these and other factors, although we believe
we can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and obligations for
the remainder of 2009, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do
so.  An inability to obtain necessary additional funding on acceptable
terms would have a material adverse impact on us and on our ability to sustain
our operations.

The
amount of the reserves we are required to maintain under our credit card
processing agreements could increase substantially, which would materially
adversely impact our liquidity.
     
American
has agreements with a number of credit card companies and processors to accept
credit cards for the sale of air travel and other services.  Under
certain of American’s current credit card processing agreements, the related
credit card company or processor may hold back, under certain circumstances, a
reserve from American’s credit card receivables.
     
Under one
such agreement, which was recently amended, the amount of such reserve generally
is based on the amount of unrestricted cash (not including undrawn credit
facilities) held by the Company and the processor’s exposure to the Company
under the agreement.  Given the volatility of fuel prices and
revenues, uncertainty in the capital markets and uncertainty about other sources
of funding, and other factors, it is difficult to forecast the required amount
of such reserve at any time.  The amount of the reserve was $154
million as of June 30, 2009.  The agreement limits the maximum amount
of the reserve (determined as described above) during the period ending February
15, 2010, and the Company currently estimates such maximum amount during that
period to be approximately $300 million.  However, if current
conditions persist, absent a waiver or modification of the agreement, such
required amount could be substantially greater after such period.

Our initiatives to generate
additional revenues and to reduce our costs may not be adequate or
successful.

As we
seek to improve our financial condition, we must continue to take steps to
generate additional revenues and to reduce our costs.  Although we
have a number of initiatives underway to address our cost and revenue
challenges, some of these initiatives involve changes to our business which we
may be unable to implement. In addition, we expect that, as time goes on, it
will be progressively more difficult to identify and implement significant
revenue enhancement and cost savings initiatives.  The adequacy and
ultimate success of our initiatives to generate additional revenues and reduce
our costs are not known at this time and cannot be assured.  Moreover,
whether our initiatives will be adequate or successful depends in large measure
on factors beyond our control, notably the overall industry environment,
including passenger demand, yield and industry capacity growth, and fuel
prices.  It will be very difficult for us to continue to fund our
obligations on an ongoing basis, and to return to profitability, if the overall
industry revenue environment does not improve substantially or if fuel prices
were to increase and persist for an extended period at high levels.

We may be adversely affected by
increases in fuel prices, and we would be adversely affected by disruptions in
the supply of fuel.
     
Our
results are very significantly affected by the volatile price and the
availability of jet fuel, which are in turn affected by a number of factors
beyond our control.  Fuel prices have only recently declined from
historic high levels.
     
Due to
the competitive nature of the airline industry, we may not be able to pass on
increased fuel prices to customers by increasing fares.  Although we
had some success in raising fares and imposing fuel surcharges in reaction to
recent high fuel prices, these fare increases and surcharges did not keep pace
with the extraordinary increases in the price of fuel that occurred in 2007 and
2008.  Furthermore, even though fuel prices have declined
significantly from their recent historic high levels, reduced demand or
increased fare competition, or both, and resulting lower revenues may offset any
potential benefit of these lower fuel prices.

 






 



While we
do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability,
dependence on foreign imports of crude oil, limited refining capacity and the
possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production,
transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future
availability of jet fuel.  If there are additional outbreaks of
hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas or elsewhere, or a
reduction in refining capacity (due to weather events, for example), or
governmental limits on the production or sale of jet fuel, there could be a
reduction in the supply of jet fuel and significant increases in the cost of jet
fuel.  Major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or significant
increases in its cost would have a material adverse impact on us.
     
We have a
large number of older aircraft in our fleet, and these aircraft are not as fuel
efficient as more recent models of aircraft.  We believe it is
imperative that we continue to execute our fleet renewal
plans.  However, due to the recent machinist strike at Boeing,
deliveries of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft we currently have on order have been
delayed.  In addition, we expect delays in the deliveries of the
Boeing 787-9 aircraft we currently have on order.
     
While we
seek to manage the risk of fuel price increases by using derivative contracts,
there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have derivatives in
place to provide any particular level of protection against increased fuel
costs.  In addition, a deterioration of our financial position could
negatively affect our ability to enter into derivative contracts in the
future.  Moreover, declines in fuel prices below the levels
established in derivative contracts may require us to post cash collateral to
secure the loss positions on such contracts, and if such contracts close when
fuel prices are below the applicable levels, we would be required to make
payments to close such contracts; these payments would be treated as additional
fuel expense.

Our indebtedness and other
obligations are substantial and could adversely affect our business and
liquidity.
     
We have
and will continue to have significant amounts of indebtedness, obligations to
make future payments on aircraft equipment and property leases, and obligations
under aircraft purchase agreements, as well as a high proportion of debt to
equity capital.  In 2009, we will be required to make approximately
$2.0 billion of principal payments on long-term debt and payments on capital
leases.  We expect to incur substantial additional debt (including
secured debt) and lease obligations in the future.  We also have
substantial pension funding obligations. Our substantial indebtedness and other
obligations have important consequences. For example, they:




 
      

•

 
      

limit
      our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital
      expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes, and adversely
      affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained;



 
      
 
      
 
      
 
      


 
      

•

 
      

require
      us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to
      payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the
      funds available for other purposes;



 
      
 
      
 
      
 
      


 
      

•

 
      

make
      us more vulnerable to economic downturns; and



 
      
 
      
 
      
 
      


 
      

•

 
      

limit
      our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility
      in responding to changing business and economic
  conditions.





We may be unable to comply with our
financial covenants.
     
American
has a $433 million secured bank term loan facility (the Credit Facility) with a
final maturity on December 17, 2010. The Credit Facility contains a liquidity
covenant (the Liquidity Covenant) and a covenant that requires AMR to maintain
certain minimum ratios of cash flow to fixed charges (the EBITDAR
Covenant).  We were in compliance with the Liquidity Covenant as of
June 30, 2009.  In June 2009, AMR and American entered into an
amendment to the Credit Facility which waived compliance with the EBITDAR
Covenant for the quarter ended June 30, 2009; however, even absent this waiver
we would have complied with this covenant as of June 30, 2009.  In
addition, the amendment reduced the minimum ratios AMR is required to satisfy to
0.95 to 1.00 for the one, two and three quarter periods ending September 30,
2009, December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010, respectively, to 1.00 to 1.00 for
the four quarter period ending June 30, 2010, and to 1.05 to 1.00 for the four
quarter period ending September 30, 2010.  Given the volatility of
fuel prices and revenues, uncertainty in the capital markets and uncertainty
about other sources of funding, and other factors, it is difficult to assess
whether we will be able to continue to comply with the Liquidity Covenant and
the EBITDAR Covenant, and there are no assurances that we will be able to do so.
Failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under the
Credit Facility which — if we did not take steps to obtain a waiver of, or
otherwise mitigate, the default — could result in a default under a significant
amount of our other debt and lease obligations, and otherwise have a material
adverse impact on us and our ability to sustain our operations.


 








 



Our business is affected by many
changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, and our results of
operations tend to be volatile and fluctuate due to
seasonality.
     
Our
business and our results of operations are affected by many changing economic
and other conditions beyond
our
control, including, among others:




 
      

•

 
      

actual
      or potential changes in international, national, regional and local
      economic, business and financial conditions, including recession,
      inflation, higher interest rates, wars, terrorist attacks or political
      instability;



 
      
 
      
 
      
 
      


 
      

•

 
      

changes
      in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns or demographic
      trends;



 
      
 
      
 
      
 
      


 
      

•

 
      

changes
      in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation and other
      factors;



 
      
 
      
 
      
 
      


 
      

•

 
      

actual
      or potential disruptions to the air traffic control
    systems;



 
      
 
      
 
      
 
      


 
      

•

 
      

increases
      in costs of safety, security and environmental
measures;



 
      
 
      
 
      
 
      


 
      

•

 
      

outbreaks
      of diseases that affect travel behavior; and



 
      
 
      
 
      
 
      


 
      

•

 
      

weather
      and natural disasters.




     
As a
result, our results of operations tend to be volatile and subject to rapid and
unexpected change. In addition, due to generally greater demand for air travel
during the summer, our revenues in the second and third quarters of the year
tend to be stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the
year.

The airline industry is fiercely
competitive and may undergo further consolidation or changes in industry
alliances, and we are subject to increasing competition.
     
Service
over almost all of our routes is highly competitive and fares remain at low
levels by historical standards. We face vigorous, and, in some cases,
increasing, competition from major domestic airlines, national, regional,
all-cargo and charter carriers, foreign air carriers, low-cost carriers and,
particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation.  We
also face increasing and significant competition from marketing/operational
alliances formed by our competitors.  The percentage of routes on
which we compete with carriers having substantially lower operating costs than
ours has grown significantly over the past decade, and we now compete with
low-cost carriers on a large majority of our domestic non-stop mainline network
routes.
    
Certain
airline alliances have been granted immunity from antitrust regulations by
governmental authorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint
pricing decisions.  To the extent alliances formed by our competitors
can undertake activities that are not available to us, our ability to
effectively compete may be hindered.
     
Pricing
decisions are significantly affected by competition from other
airlines.  Fare discounting by competitors historically has had a
negative effect on our financial results because we must generally match
competitors’ fares, since failing to match would result in even less
revenue.  We have faced increased competition from carriers with
simplified fare structures, which are generally preferred by
travelers.  Any fare reduction or fare simplification initiative may
not be offset by increases in passenger traffic, reduction in cost or changes in
the mix of traffic that would improve yields.  Moreover, decisions by
our competitors that increase or reduce overall industry capacity, or capacity
dedicated to a particular domestic or foreign region, market or route, can have
a material impact on related fare levels.
     
There
have been numerous mergers and acquisitions within the airline industry and
numerous changes in industry alliances. Recently, two of our largest
competitors, Delta Air Lines, Inc. and Northwest Airlines Corporation, merged,
and the combined entity became the largest scheduled passenger airline in the
world in terms of available seat miles and revenue passenger
miles.  In addition, another two of our largest competitors, United
Air Lines, Inc. and Continental Airlines, Inc., recently announced that they had
entered into a framework agreement to cooperate extensively and under which
Continental would join the global alliance of which United, Lufthansa and
certain other airlines are members.

 






 



In the
future, there may be additional mergers and acquisitions, and changes in airline
alliances, including those that may be undertaken in response to the merger of
Delta and Northwest or other developments in the airline
industry.  Any airline industry consolidation or changes in airline
alliances could substantially alter the competitive landscape and result in
changes in our corporate or business strategy.  We regularly assess
and explore the potential for consolidation in our industry and changes in
airline alliances, our strategic position and ways to enhance our
competitiveness, including the possibilities for our participation in merger
activity.  Consolidation involving other participants in our industry
could result in the formation of one or more airlines with greater financial
resources, more extensive networks, and/or lower cost structures than exist
currently, which could have a material adverse effect on us.  For
similar reasons, changes in airline alliances could also adversely affect our
competitive position.
    
In 2008,
we entered into a joint business agreement and related marketing arrangements
with British Airways and Iberia, providing for commercial cooperation on flights
between North America and most countries in Europe, pooling and sharing of
certain revenues and costs, expanded codesharing, enhanced frequent flyer
program reciprocity, and cooperation in other areas.  Along with these
carriers and certain other carriers, we have applied to the U.S. Department of
Transportation for antitrust immunity for this planned
cooperation.  Implementation of this agreement and the related
arrangements is subject to conditions, including various U.S. and foreign
regulatory approvals, successful negotiation of certain detailed financial and
commercial arrangements, and other approvals. Agencies from which such approvals
must be obtained may impose requirements or limitations as a condition of
granting any such approvals, such as requiring divestiture of routes, gates,
slots or other assets.  No assurances can be given as to any
arrangements that may ultimately be implemented or any benefits that we may
derive from such arrangements.

We compete with reorganized carriers,
which results in competitive disadvantages for us.

We must
compete with air carriers that have reorganized under the protection of
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in recent years, including United, Delta,
Northwest and U.S. Airways.  It is possible that other significant
competitors may seek to reorganize in or out of Chapter 11.
     
Successful
reorganizations by other carriers present us with competitors with significantly
lower operating costs and stronger financial positions derived from renegotiated
labor, supply, and financing contracts.  These competitive pressures
may limit our ability to adequately price our services, may require us to
further reduce our operating costs, and could have a material adverse impact on
us.

Fares are at low levels and our
reduced pricing power adversely affects our ability to achieve adequate pricing,
especially with respect to business travel.
     
Our
passenger yield remains very low by historical standards.  We believe
that this is due in large part to a corresponding decline in our pricing
power.  Our reduced pricing power is the product of several factors
including: greater cost sensitivity on the part of travelers (particularly
business travelers); pricing transparency resulting from the use of the
Internet; greater competition from low-cost carriers and from carriers that have
recently reorganized under the protection of Chapter 11; other carriers
being well hedged against rising fuel costs and able to better absorb high jet
fuel prices; and fare simplification efforts by certain carriers.  We
believe that our reduced pricing power could persist indefinitely.

Our corporate or business strategy
may change.

In light
of the rapid changes in the airline industry, we evaluate our assets on an
ongoing basis with a view to maximizing their value to us and determining which
are core to our operations.  We also regularly evaluate our corporate
and business strategies, and they are influenced by factors beyond our control,
including changes in the competitive landscape we face. Our corporate and
business strategies are, therefore, subject to change.

 





 

Beginning
in late 2007 and continuing into 2008, AMR conducted a strategic value review
involving, among other things, AMR Eagle, American Beacon Advisors, Inc., AMR’s
investment advisory subsidiary (“American Beacon Advisors”) and AAdvantage, our
frequent flyer program.  The purpose of the review was to determine
whether there existed the potential for unlocking additional stockholder value
with respect to one or more of these strategic assets through some type of
separation transaction.  As a result of this review, AMR announced in
late 2007 that it planned to divest AMR Eagle; however, in mid-2008 AMR
announced that, given the then-current industry environment, AMR had decided to
place that planned divestiture on hold until industry conditions are more
favorable and stable.  Also pursuant to the review, AMR sold American
Beacon Advisors to a third party in September 2008 (AMR maintained a
minority equity stake).
    
In the
future, AMR may consider and engage in discussions with third parties regarding
the divestiture of AMR Eagle and other separation transactions, and may decide
to proceed with one or more such transactions.  There can be no
assurance that AMR will complete any separation transactions, that any announced
plans or transactions will be consummated, or as to the impact of these
transactions on stockholder value or on us.

Our business is subject to extensive
government regulation, which can result in increases in our costs, disruptions
to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand
for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.
     
Airlines
are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements.
Many of these requirements result in significant costs.  For example,
the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to
the maintenance and operation of aircraft.  Compliance with those
requirements drives significant expenditures and has in the past, and may in the
future, cause disruptions to our operations.  In addition, the ability
of U.S. carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because
the applicable arrangements between the United States and foreign governments
may be amended from time to time, or because appropriate slots or facilities are
not made available.
     
Moreover,
additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been
enacted from time to time that have significantly increased the costs of airline
operations, reduced the demand for air travel or restricted the way we can
conduct our business.  For example, the Aviation and Transportation
Security Act, which became law in 2001, mandated the federalization of certain
airport security procedures and resulted in the imposition of additional
security requirements on airlines.  In addition, many aspects of our
operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and
concerns about climate change, in particular, may result in the imposition of
additional regulation.  For example, the U.S. Congress is considering
climate change legislation, and the European Union (the “EU”) has approved a
proposal that will put a cap on carbon dioxide emissions for all flights into
and out of the EU effective in 2012.  Laws or regulations similar to
those described above or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions in the
future may adversely affect our business and financial results.
     
The
results of our operations, demand for air travel, and the manner in which we
conduct our business each may be affected by changes in law and future actions
taken by governmental agencies, including:




 
      

•

 
      

changes
      in law which affect the services that can be offered by airlines in
      particular markets and at particular airports;



 
      
 
      
 
      
 
      


 
      

•

 
      

the

In
addition, the air traffic control (“ATC”) system, which is operated by the FAA,
is not successfully managing the growing demand for U.S. air
travel.  U.S. airlines carry about 740 million passengers a year
and are forecasted to accommodate a billion passengers annually by
2015.  Air-traffic controllers rely on outdated technologies that
routinely overwhelm the system and compel airlines to fly inefficient, indirect
routes.  We support a common-sense approach to ATC modernization that
would allocate cost to all ATC system users in proportion to the services they
consume.  The reauthorization by the U.S. Congress of legislation that
funds the FAA, which includes proposals regarding upgrades to the ATC system, is
pending, but it is uncertain when any such legislation will be
enacted.

We could be adversely affected by
conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks.
     
Actual or
threatened U.S. military involvement in overseas operations has, on occasion,
had an adverse impact on our business, financial position (including access to
capital markets) and results of operations, and on the airline industry in
general. The continuing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, or other conflicts or
events in the Middle East or elsewhere, may result in similar adverse
impacts.
     
The
Terrorist Attacks had a material adverse impact on us.  The occurrence
of another terrorist attack (whether domestic or international and whether
against us or another entity) could again have a material adverse impact on
us.

Our international operations could be
adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions
beyond our control.
     
Our
current international activities and prospects could be adversely affected by
factors such as reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, exchange
controls, currency and political risks, environmental regulation, taxation and
changes in international government regulation of our operations, including the
inability to obtain or retain needed route authorities and/or
slots.
     
For
example, the “open skies” air services agreement between the United States and
the EU which took effect in March 2008 provides airlines from the United
States and EU member states open access to each other’s markets, with freedom of
pricing and unlimited rights to fly beyond the United States and any airport in
the EU including London’s Heathrow Airport.  The agreement has
resulted in American facing increased competition in these markets, including
Heathrow, where we have lost market share.

We could be adversely affected by an
outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior.
     
In the
second quarter of 2009, there was an outbreak of the H1N1 virus which had an
adverse impact throughout our network but primarily on our operations to and
from Mexico.  In 2003, there was an outbreak of Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (“SARS”), which had an adverse impact primarily on our Asia
operations. In addition, in the past there have been concerns about outbreaks or
potential outbreaks of other diseases, such as avian flu.  Any
outbreak of a disease (including a worsening of the outbreak of the H1N1 virus)
that affects travel behavior could have a material adverse impact on
us.  In addition, outbreaks of disease could result in quarantines of
our personnel or an inability to access facilities or our aircraft, which could
adversely affect our operations.

Our labor costs are higher than those
of our competitors.
     
Wages,
salaries and benefits constitute a significant percentage of our total operating
expenses. In 2008, they constituted approximately 23 percent of our total
operating expenses.  All of the major hub-and-spoke carriers with whom
American competes have achieved significant labor cost savings through or
outside of bankruptcy proceedings.  We believe American’s labor costs
are higher than those of its primary competitors, and it is unclear how long
this labor cost disadvantage may persist.

We could be adversely affected if we
are unable to have satisfactory relations with any unionized or other employee
work group.
     
Our
operations could be adversely affected if we fail to have satisfactory relations
with any labor union representing our employees.  In addition, any
significant dispute we have with, or any disruption by, an employee work group
could adversely impact us.  Moreover, one of the fundamental tenets of
our strategic Turnaround Plan is increased union and employee involvement in our
operations.  To the extent that we are unable to have satisfactory
relations with any unionized or other employee work group, our ability to
execute our strategic plans could be adversely affected.







American
is currently in mediated negotiations with each of its three major unions
regarding amendments to their respective labor agreements.  The
negotiations process in the airline industry typically is slow and sometimes
contentious.  The union that represents American’s pilots has recently
filed a number of grievances, lawsuits and complaints, most of which American
believes are part of a corporate campaign related to the union’s labor agreement
negotiations with American.  While American is vigorously defending
these claims, unfavorable outcomes of one or more of them could require American
to incur additional costs, change the way it conducts some parts of its
business, or otherwise adversely affect us.

Our insurance costs have increased
substantially and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage
could have an adverse impact on us.
     
We carry
insurance for public liability, passenger liability, property damage and
all-risk coverage for damage to our aircraft.  As a result of the
Terrorist Attacks, aviation insurers significantly reduced the amount of
insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons
other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism,
war or similar events (war-risk coverage).  At the same time, these
insurers significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance in
general.
     
The U.S.
government has agreed to provide commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based
airlines through September 30, 2009, covering losses to employees, passengers,
third parties and aircraft.  If the U.S. government does not provide
such insurance at any time beyond that date, or reduces the coverage provided by
such insurance, we will attempt to purchase similar coverage with narrower scope
from commercial insurers at an additional cost.  To the extent this
coverage is not available at commercially reasonable rates, we would be
adversely affected.
     
While the
price of commercial insurance had declined since the period immediately after
the Terrorist Attacks, in the event commercial insurance carriers further reduce
the amount of insurance coverage available to us, or significantly increase its
cost, we would be adversely affected.

We may be unable to retain key
management personnel.
     
Since the
Terrorist Attacks, a number of our key management employees have elected to
retire early or leave for more financially favorable opportunities at other
companies, both within and outside of the airline industry.  There can
be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key management
employees.  Any inability to retain our key management employees, or
attract and retain additional qualified management employees, could have a
negative impact on us.

We could be adversely affected by a
failure or disruption of our computer, communications or other technology
systems.
     
We are
heavily and increasingly dependent on technology to operate our
business.  The computer and communications systems on which we rely
could be disrupted due to various events, some of which are beyond our control,
including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, equipment
failures, software failures and computer viruses and hackers.  We have
taken certain steps to help reduce the risk of some (but not all) of these
potential disruptions.  There can be no assurance, however, that the
measures we have taken are adequate to prevent or remedy disruptions or failures
of these systems.  Any substantial or repeated failure of these
systems could impact our operations and customer service, result in the loss of
important data, loss of revenues, and increased costs, and generally harm our
business.  Moreover, a failure of certain of our vital systems could
limit our ability to operate our flights for an extended period of time, which
would have a material adverse impact on our operations and our
business.

We are at risk of losses and adverse
publicity which might result from an accident involving any of our
aircraft.
     
If one of
our aircraft were to be involved in an accident, we could be exposed to
significant tort liability. The insurance we carry to cover damages arising from
any future accidents may be inadequate.  In the event that our
insurance is not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an
accident.  In addition, any accident involving an aircraft operated by
us could adversely affect the public’s perception of us.

FORM OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT AGREEMENT



ex101.htm





STOCK
APPRECIATION RIGHT AGREEMENT

STOCK
APPRECIATION RIGHT AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is granted effective as of July
20, 2009, by AMR Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Corporation”), to
[FIRST NAME LAST NAME], employee number [EMPLOYEE NUMBER], an employee of the
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries (the “Grantee”).

W I T N E
S S E T H:

WHEREAS,
the stockholders of the Corporation approved the AMR Corporation 2009 Long Term
Incentive Plan at the Corporation’s annual meeting held on May 20 2009 (such
plan, as may be amended from time to time, to be referenced the
“LTIP”);

WHEREAS,
the LTIP provides for the grant of stock appreciation rights in respect of
shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock (as later defined) to those individuals
selected by the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of
Directors (the “Board”) or, in lieu thereof, the Board; and

WHEREAS,
the Committee has determined that it is to the advantage and interest of the
Corporation to grant the stock appreciation right provided for herein to the
Grantee as an incentive for Grantee to remain in the employ of the Corporation
or one of its Subsidiaries, and to provide Grantee an incentive to increase the
value of the Corporation’s Common Stock, $1 par value (the “Common
Stock”).

NOW,
THEREFORE:

1. Stock
Appreciation Right Grant.  The Corporation hereby grants to the
Grantee effective the date of this Agreement (the “Grant Date”) a stock
appreciation right, subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth,
in respect of an aggregate of [NUMBER] shares of Common Stock.  The
base price (“Base Price”) of each such stock appreciation right is $[Base Price]
per share (which is the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date
hereof).  The stock appreciation right granted hereby is exercisable
in approximately equal installments on and after the following dates and with
respect to the following number of shares of Common Stock:





Exercisable On and After


Aggregate Number of
  Shares




First
      Anniversary of Grant Date


20%
      of total award




Second
      Anniversary of Grant Date


40%
      of total award




Third
      Anniversary of Grant Date


60%
      of total award




Fourth
      Anniversary of Grant Date


80%
      of total award




Fifth
      Anniversary of Grant Date


100%
      of total award




provided,
that in no event shall this stock appreciation right be exercisable in whole or
in part ten years from the Grant Date.  The right to exercise this
stock appreciation right and to purchase the number of shares comprising each
such installment shall be cumulative, and once such right has become exercisable
it may be exercised in whole at any time and in part from time to time until the
date of termination of the Grantee’s rights hereunder.

2. Restriction
on Exercise.  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, this stock
appreciation right shall not be exercised if at such time such exercise or the
delivery of certificates representing shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant
hereto shall constitute a violation of any rule of the Corporation, any
provision of any applicable federal or state statute, rule or regulation, or any
rule or regulation of any securities exchange on which the Common Stock may be
listed.

3. Exercise.  This
stock appreciation right may be exercised with respect to all or any part of the
shares of Common Stock then subject to such exercise in accordance with Section
1 pursuant to whatever procedures may be adopted from time to time by the
Corporation.  Upon the exercise of this stock appreciation right, in
whole or in part, the Grantee shall be entitled to receive from the Corporation
a number of shares of Common Stock equal in value to the excess of the Fair
Market Value (on the date of exercise) of one share of Common Stock over the
Base Price, multiplied by the number of shares in respect of which the stock
appreciation right is being exercised.  The number of shares to be
issued shall be calculated on the basis of the Fair Market Value of the shares
on the date of exercise.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee
may elect, at any time and from time to time, in lieu of issuing all or any
portion of the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon any exercise of
any portion of this stock appreciation right, to pay the Grantee an amount in
cash or other marketable property of a value equivalent to the aggregate Fair
Market Value on the date of exercise of the number of shares of Common Stock
that the Committee is electing to settle in cash or other marketable
property.  Additionally, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (i) any obligation of the Corporation to pay or
distribute any shares under this Agreement is subject to and conditioned upon
the Corporation having sufficient stock in the LTIP to satisfy all payments or
distributions under this Agreement and the LTIP, and (ii) any obligation of the
Corporation to pay or distribute cash or any other property under this Agreement
is subject to and conditioned upon the Corporation having the right to do so
without violating the terms of any covenant or agreement of the Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries.  The amount of such cash, property, and/or
shares of Common Stock shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of federal,
state and local income taxes and payroll taxes that are required to be withheld
in connection with the payment of such cash, property, and/or shares of Common
Stock.

4. Termination
of Stock Appreciation Right.  This stock appreciation right shall
terminate and may no longer be exercised if (i) the Grantee ceases to be an
employee of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries; (ii) the Grantee becomes
an employee of a Subsidiary that is not wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by
the Corporation; or (iii) the Grantee takes a leave of absence without
reinstatement rights, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Corporation
(or one of its Subsidiaries) and the Grantee; except that

(a)           If
the Grantee’s employment by the Corporation (or any Subsidiary) terminates by
reason of death, the vesting of the stock appreciation right will be accelerated
and the stock appreciation right will remain exercisable until its
expiration;

(b)           If
the Grantee’s employment by the Corporation (or any Subsidiary) terminates by
reason of Disability, the stock appreciation right will continue to vest in
accordance with its terms and may be exercised until its expiration; provided,
however, that if the Grantee dies after such Disability the vesting of the stock
appreciation right will be accelerated and the stock appreciation right will
remain exercisable until its expiration;

(c)           Subject
to Section 7(c), if the Grantee’s employment by the Corporation (or any
Subsidiary) terminates by reason of Normal or Early Retirement, the stock
appreciation right will continue to vest in accordance with its terms and may be
exercised until its expiration; provided, however, that if the Grantee dies
after Retirement the vesting of the stock appreciation right will be accelerated
and the stock appreciation right will remain exercisable until its
expiration;

(d)           If
the Grantee’s employment by the Corporation (or any Subsidiary) is involuntarily
terminated by the Corporation or a Subsidiary (as the case may be) without
Cause, the stock appreciation right may thereafter be exercised, to the extent
it was exercisable at the time of termination, for a period of three months from
the date of such termination of employment or until the stated term of such
stock appreciation right, whichever period is shorter; and



(e)           In
the event of a Change in Control of the Corporation, this stock appreciation
right shall become exercisable in accordance with the LTIP.

5. Adjustments
in Common Stock.  In the event of a stock dividend, stock split,
merger, consolidation, re-organization, re-capitalization or other change in the
corporate structure of the Corporation, appropriate adjustments shall be made by
the Corporation and the Committee in the number of shares, class or classes of
securities and the base price per share applicable in respect to the stock
appreciation rights subject to this Agreement.

6. Non-Transferability
of Stock Appreciation Right.  Unless the Board shall permit (on such
terms and conditions as it shall establish), a stock appreciation right may not
be transferred except by will or the laws of descent and distribution to the
extent provided herein.  During the lifetime of the Grantee this stock
appreciation right may be exercised only by him or her (unless otherwise
determined by the Board).

7. Miscellaneous.

(a)           This
stock appreciation right (i) shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
any successor of the Corporation, (ii) shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Texas, and any applicable laws of the United States, and (iii) may not
be amended without the written consent of both the Corporation and the
Grantee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended
from time to time without the written consent of the Grantee pursuant to Section
10 below and as permitted by the LTIP. No contract or right of employment shall
be implied by this stock appreciation right.

(b)           If
this stock appreciation right is assumed or a new stock appreciation right is
substituted therefor in any corporate reorganization (including, but not limited
to, any transaction of the type referred to in Section 424(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)), employment by such assuming or
substituting corporation or by a parent corporation or a subsidiary thereof
shall be considered for all purposes of this stock appreciation right to be
employment by the Corporation.

(c)           In
the event the Grantee’s employment is terminated by reason of Early or Normal
Retirement and the Grantee subsequently is employed by a competitor of the
Corporation, the Corporation reserves the right, upon notice to the Grantee, to
declare the stock appreciation right forfeited and of no further
validity.

(d)           In
consideration of the Grantee’s privilege to participate in the LTIP and to
receive this stock appreciation right award, the Grantee agrees: (i) not to
disclose any trade secrets of, or other confidential or restricted information
of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to any unauthorized party; (ii)
not to make any unauthorized use of such trade secrets or confidential or
restricted information during or after his or her employment with any Subsidiary
of the Corporation; and (iii) not to solicit any then current employees of any
Subsidiary of the Corporation to join the employee at his or her new place of
employment after such employment has terminated.  In addition to all
other rights and remedies available to the Corporation, the failure by the
employee to abide by the foregoing obligations shall result in his or her award
being forfeited in its entirety.

(e)           To
the extent the stock appreciation right award is forfeited, any and all rights
of the Grantee under this Agreement shall cease and terminate with respect to
such forfeited award, or portion thereof, without any further obligation on the
part of the Corporation.

8. Securities
Law Requirements.  Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to
the contrary, the Corporation shall not be required to issue shares upon the
exercise of this stock appreciation right during such period that the
Corporation reasonably anticipates that issuing the shares will violate federal
securities laws or other applicable law.  The Corporation may require
the Grantee to furnish to the Corporation, prior to the issuance of any shares
in connection with the exercise of this stock appreciation right, an agreement,
in such form as the Corporation may from time to time deem appropriate, in which

distribution thereof.

interpreted in a manner consistent with that intent described
above.  In addition to amendments permitted by Section 7(a) above,

the Committee, without the Grantee’s consent, in order to ensure compliance with
Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and other guidance issued

ex102.htm





 
DEFERRED
SHARE AWARD AGREEMENT


This
Deferred Share Award Agreement (the “Agreement”) is effective as of July 20,
2009, by and between AMR Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
“Corporation”), and [FIRST NAME LAST NAME], employee number [EMPLOYEE
NUMBER] (the
“Employee”), an officer or key employee of one of the Corporation’s
Subsidiaries.

WHEREAS,
pursuant to the AMR Corporation 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan (as amended, the
“LTIP”), the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors
of the Corporation (the “Board”) has determined that the Employee is an officer
or key employee and has further determined to make an award of deferred stock
from and pursuant to the LTIP (the “Award”) to the Employee as an inducement for
the Employee to remain an employee of one of the Corporation’s
Subsidiaries.

NOW,
THEREFORE, the Corporation and the Employee hereby agree as
follows:

1.           Grant of
Award.

Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Employee is hereby granted
the Award effective as of July 20, 2009 (the “Grant Date”), in respect to
[NUMBER] shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock (the
“Shares”).  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Shares covered by the Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with Section 2
hereof, on July 20, 2012 (such date hereby established as the “Vesting Date” of
the Award).

2.           Distribution of
Award.

Distribution
with respect to the Award will occur, if at all, in accordance with the
following terms and conditions:

(a)           If
the Employee is on the payroll of a Subsidiary that is wholly-owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Corporation as of the Vesting Date, the Shares covered by the
Award will be paid by the Corporation to the Employee on or about the Vesting
Date.

(b)           In
the event the Employee’s employment with a Subsidiary of the Corporation is
terminated prior to the Vesting Date due to the Employee’s death, Disability,
Retirement or termination not for Cause (each an “Early Termination”), the
Shares covered by the Award will vest on a pro-rata basis and will be paid to
the Employee (or, in the event of the Employee’s death, the Employee’s
designated beneficiary for the purposes of the Award, or in the absence of an
effective beneficiary designation, the Employee’s estate).  The
pro-rata basis will be a percentage where: (i) the denominator of which is 36,
and (ii) the numerator of which is the number of months from the Grant Date
through the month of Early Termination, inclusive.  The Shares
comprising the pro-rata Award will be paid by the Corporation to the Employee
(or, in the event of the Employee’s death, the Employee’s designated beneficiary
for the purposes of the Award, or in the absence of an effective beneficiary
designation, the Employee’s estate) on or about the Vesting Date, subject to
Section 2(e) of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event will a payment be provided to the Employee unless and until the Employee’s
Retirement or termination not for Cause constitutes a “separation from service”
for purposes of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h) or successor guidance
thereto.

(c)           In
the event of a Change in Control of the Corporation prior to the payment of the
Shares subject to the Award, such payment will be made within 60 days of the
date of the Change in Control.  In such event, the Vesting Date will
be the date of the Change in Control.

(d)           Notwithstanding
the terms of Sections 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c), the Award will be forfeited in its
entirety if prior to the Vesting Date:





 
      


(i)


the
      Employee’s employment with a Subsidiary of the Corporation is terminated
      for Cause, or if the Employee terminates such employment prior to his or
      her Retirement;









 
      


(ii)


the
      Employee becomes an employee of a Subsidiary that is not wholly-owned,
      directly or indirectly, by the Corporation;
or









(iii)  


the
      Employee takes a leave of absence without reinstatement rights, unless
      otherwise agreed in writing between the Corporation (or a Subsidiary or
      Affiliate thereof) and the
Employee.





(e) Notwithstanding
the third sentence of Section 2(b) above, if the Employee is a “specified
employee” pursuant to Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(i) or successor guidance
thereto, any payment on account of his or her Retirement or termination not for
Cause shall be delayed until following the earlier of: (i) the sixth month
anniversary of the date of separation from employment due to Retirement or
termination not for Cause or (ii) the date of the Employee’s death.

(f) To the
extent the Shares covered by the
Award are otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement and except as otherwise
provided herein, such Shares will be paid on the applicable dates and events
specified herein (each a “Payment Date”); provided however, in no event shall
any such payment be made later than the 15th day of the third month of the
calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Payment Date
occurs.

(g) The
amount of the Shares paid hereunder shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of
federal, state, and local income and payroll taxes that are required to be
withheld in connection with the payment of such Shares.

3.           Transfer
Restrictions.

Unless
otherwise permitted by the Committee, this award is non-transferable, other than
by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and may not be assigned,
pledged or hypothecated and will not be subject to execution, attachment or
similar process.  Upon any attempt by the Employee (or the Employee’s
successor in the interest after the Employee’s death) to effect any such
disposition, or upon the levy of any such process, the Award may immediately
become null and void, at the discretion of the Committee.

4.           [Intentionally
omitted]

5.           Miscellaneous.

This
Agreement (a) will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successor of
the Corporation, (b) will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas and any
applicable laws of the United States, and (c) may not be amended without the
written consent of both the Corporation and the
Employee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be
amended from time to time without the written consent of the Employee pursuant
to Section 7 below and as permitted by the LTIP.  No contract or right
of employment will be implied by this Agreement.

In consideration of the Employee’s
privilege to receive the Award under this Agreement, the Employee agrees: (i)
not to disclose any trade secrets of, or other confidential or restricted
information of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to any unauthorized
party; (ii) not to make any unauthorized use of such trade secrets or
confidential or restricted information during or after his or her employment
with any Subsidiary of the Corporation; and (iii) not to solicit any then
current employees of any Subsidiary of the Corporation to join the employee at
his or her new place of employment after such employment has
terminated.  In addition to all other rights and remedies available to
the Corporation, the failure by the Employee to abide by the foregoing
obligations shall result in his or her award being forfeited in its
entirety.


The
Employee shall not have the right to defer any payment of the Shares covered by
the Award.  Except as provided in this Agreement, the Committee and
Corporation will not accelerate the payment of any of the Shares covered by the
Award.

Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Committee may elect, at any time
and from time to time, in lieu of issuing all or any portion of the Shares, to
make substitutions for such Shares, all to the effect that the Employee will
receive cash or other marketable property of a value equivalent to what the
Employee would have received upon a payment of Shares.  Additionally,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) any
obligation of the Corporation to pay or distribute any shares under this
Agreement is subject to and conditioned upon the Corporation having sufficient
stock in the LTIP  to satisfy all payments or distributions under this
Agreement and the LTIP, and (ii) any obligation of the Corporation to pay or
distribute cash or any other property under this Agreement is subject to and
conditioned upon the Corporation having the right to do so without violating the
terms of any covenant or agreement of the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries.

To the
extent the Award is forfeited, any and all rights of the Employee under this
Agreement shall cease and terminate with respect to such forfeited Award, or
portion thereof, without any further obligation on the part of the
Corporation.

Capitalized
terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth for such
terms in the LTIP.

6.           Adjustments in
Awards.

In the
event of a stock dividend, stock split, merger, consolidation, re-organization,
re-capitalization or other change in the corporate structure of the Corporation,
appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Corporation and the Committee to
the Award.

7.           Section 409A
Compliance.

This
Agreement is intended to avoid, and not otherwise be subject to, the income
inclusion requirements, interest and penalty taxes of Section 409A of the Code,
and the regulations and other guidance issued thereunder, and shall be
interpreted in a manner consistent with that intent.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event there is a failure to comply with Section 409A of
the Code, the Corporation and the Committee shall have the discretion to
accelerate the time of payment of the Shares covered by the Award, but only to
the extent of the amount required to be included in income as a result of such
failure.  Amendments to this Agreement and/or the LTIP may be made by
the Corporation, without the Employee’s consent, in order to ensure compliance
with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and other guidance issued
thereunder.





8.  


Securities Law
      Requirements.





Notwithstanding
any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Corporation shall not be
required to make any distribution of Shares pursuant to this Award during such
period that the Corporation reasonably anticipates that such distribution will
violate federal securities laws or other applicable law.  The
Corporation may require the Employee to furnish to the Corporation, prior to the
issuance of any Shares hereunder, an agreement, in such form as the Corporation
may from time to time deem appropriate, in which the Employee represents that
the Shares acquired by him or her hereunder are being acquired for investment
and not with a view to the sale or distribution thereof.

IN
WITNESS HEREOF, this Agreement is entered into as of the date first above
written.

ex103.htm





2009/2011
PERFORMANCE SHARE AGREEMENT


This 2009/2011 Performance Share
Agreement (“Agreement”) is effective as of July 20, 2009, by and between AMR
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Corporation”), and [FIRST NAME LAST
NAME], employee number [EMPLOYEE NUMBER] (the “Employee” or the “Recipient”), an
officer or key employee of one of the Corporation’s Subsidiaries.

WHEREAS, pursuant to the 2009/2011
Performance Share Plan for Officers and Key Employees (the “Plan”) adopted by
the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation (the “Board”), the Committee has determined to make an award to the
Employee (subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement), as an inducement
for the Employee to remain an employee of one of the Corporation’s Subsidiaries
during the time frame of 2009 - 2011 and to retain and motivate such Employee
during such employment.

This Agreement sets forth the terms and
conditions attendant to the Award under the Plan.

1.           Grant of
Award.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Plan and the AMR Corporation 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan (as amended, the
“LTIP”), the Recipient is hereby granted an award (the “Award”) effective as of
July 20, 2009 (the “Grant Date”), in respect to [NUMBER] shares of the
Corporation’s Common Stock (“Common Stock”).  The Award shall vest, if
at all, in accordance with Section 2 of this Agreement.  On or about
the date the Award vests (if at all), the Recipient will receive a payment from
the Corporation of a combination of cash and/or Common Stock.  The
Committee will determine the amount of the Award to be paid in cash, if any (the
“Cash Award”), and the amount of the Award to be settled in shares of Common
Stock, if any (the “Stock Distribution”).  Any such Cash Award will be
paid on or about April 30, 2012 (such Cash Award will be made pursuant to the
Annual Incentive Plan, as applicable).  The Stock Distribution will be
paid on or about April 18, 2012 (such Stock Distribution will be made from
shares available for issuance under the LTIP and/or another equity compensation
plan).  Subject to Section 2 below and the terms of the Plan, the sum
of the Cash Award and the Stock Distribution will equal the product of: (a) the
Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on April 18, 2012, and (b) the number of
shares of Common Stock comprising the Award.





2.


Vesting and
      Distribution.





(a)           The
Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with Schedule A, attached hereto and
made a part of this Agreement.

(b)           In
the event the Employee’s employment with one of the Corporation’s Subsidiaries
is terminated prior to the end of the measurement period set forth in Schedule A
(the “Measurement Period”) due to his or her death, Disability, Retirement
(subject to the second paragraph of Section 4) or termination not for Cause
(each an “Early Termination”), the Award will vest, if at all, on a pro-rata
basis and will be paid to the Employee (or, in the event of the Employee’s
death, the Employee’s designated beneficiary for purposes of the Award, or in
the absence of an effective beneficiary designation, the Employee’s
estate).  The pro-rata basis will be a percentage where: (i) the
denominator of which is 36, and (ii) the numerator of which is the number of
months from January 1, 2009 through the month of Early Termination,
inclusive.  The cash and/or Common Stock subject to this pro-rata
Award will be paid to the Recipient at the same time as Cash Awards and Stock
Distributions under the Plan are paid to then current employees who have Awards
under the Plan, subject to Section 2(f) of this
Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will a payment
be provided to the Employee unless and until the Employee’s Retirement or
termination not for Cause constitutes a “separation from service” for purposes
of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h) or successor guidance thereto.

(c)           In
the event the Recipient’s employment with one of the Corporation’s Subsidiaries
is terminated for Cause, or if the Recipient terminates such employment with
such Subsidiary prior to his or her Retirement, each occurring prior to April
18, 2012, the Award shall be forfeited in its entirety.

(d) If, prior
to April 18, 2012, the Recipient becomes an employee of a Subsidiary that is not
wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, or if the Recipient
begins a leave of absence without reinstatement rights, then in each case the
Award shall be forfeited in its entirety.

(e) In the
event of a Change in Control of the Corporation prior to the payment of the cash
and/or Common Stock subject to the Award, such payment will be made within 60
days of the date of the Change in Control.  In such event, the vesting
date will be the date of the Change in Control.

(f) Notwithstanding
the third sentence of Section 2(b) above, if the Employee is a “specified
employee” pursuant to Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(i) or successor guidance
thereto, any payment on account of his or her Retirement or termination not for
Cause shall not be paid until following the earlier of: (i) the sixth month
anniversary of the date of separation from employment due to Retirement or
termination not for Cause or (ii) the date of the Employee’s death.

(g) To the
extent the Cash Award and/or Stock Distribution subject to the Award is
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement and except as otherwise provided
herein, such Cash Award and/or Stock Distribution will be paid on the applicable
dates and events specified herein (each a “Payment Date”); provided, however, in
no event shall any such payment be made later than the 15th day of the third
month of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the
Payment Date occurs.

3.           Transfer
Restrictions.  This Award is non-transferable, other than by
will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and may not otherwise be
assigned, pledged or hypothecated and shall not be subject to execution,
attachment or similar process.  Upon any attempt by the Recipient (or
the Recipient’s successor in interest after the Recipient’s death) to effect any
such disposition, or upon the levy of any such process, the Award may
immediately become null and void and of no further validity, at the discretion
of the Committee.

4. Miscellaneous. This
Agreement (a) shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successor of
the Corporation, (b) shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas and any
applicable laws of the United States, and (c) may not be amended without the
written consent of both the Corporation and the
Employee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be
amended from time to time without the written consent of the Employee pursuant
to Section 8 below and as permitted by the Plan or the LTIP.  No
contract or right of employment shall be implied by this Agreement.

In the
event the Employee’s employment is terminated by reason of Early or Normal
Retirement and the Employee is subsequently employed by a competitor (as
determined in the Board’s discretion) of the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the complete payment of the cash and/or Common Stock
subject to the Award, the Corporation reserves the right, upon notice to the
Employee, to declare the Award forfeited and of no further
validity.

In consideration of the Employee’s
privilege to participate in the Plan and receive the Award under this Agreement,
the Employee agrees: (i) not to disclose any trade secrets of, or other
confidential or restricted information of the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries to any unauthorized party; (ii) not to make any unauthorized use of
such trade secrets or confidential or restricted information during or after his
or her employment with any Subsidiary of the Corporation; and (iii) not to
solicit any then current employees of any Subsidiary of the Corporation to join
the employee at his or her new place of employment after such employment has
terminated.  In addition to all other rights and remedies available to
the Corporation, the failure by the employee to abide by the foregoing
obligations shall result in his or her award being forfeited in its
entirety.

The Employee shall not have the right
to defer any payment of the Cash Award or the Stock
Distribution.  Except as provided in this Agreement, the Committee and
Corporation shall not accelerate the payment of any Cash Award or the Stock
Distribution.

Any Cash Award will be net of
applicable withholding and social security taxes. The Employee will pay to the
Corporation timely any and all such taxes on account of the Stock Distribution.
The failure by the Employee to pay timely such taxes will result in a
withholding from any and all payments from the Corporation or any Subsidiary to
the Employee in order to satisfy such taxes.

Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement or the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may elect, at any time and
from time to time, in lieu of issuing all or any portion of the Common Stock
comprising the Stock Distribution, to make substitutions for such Common Stock,
all to the effect that the employee will receive cash or other marketable
property of a value equivalent to what the Employee would have received in a
Stock Distribution.  Additionally, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or the Plan, (i) any obligation of the
Corporation to pay or distribute any shares under this Agreement or the Plan is
subject to and conditioned upon the Corporation having sufficient stock in the
LTIP to satisfy all payments or distributions under the Plan and the LTIP, and
(ii) any obligation of the Corporation to pay or distribute cash or any other
property under this Agreement or the Plan is subject to and conditioned upon the
Corporation having the right to do so without violating the terms of any
covenant or agreement of the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries.

To the
extent the Award is forfeited, any and all rights of the Employee under this
Agreement shall cease and terminate with respect to such forfeited Award, or
portion thereof, without any further obligation on the part of the
Corporation.

5.           [Intentionally
Omitted]

6.           Adjustments in
Awards.                                                                In
the event of a stock dividend, stock split, merger, consolidation,
re-organization, re-capitalization or other change in the corporate structure of
the Corporation, appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Corporation and
the Committee to the Award.

7.           Incorporation of the
Provisions of the Plan and LTIP. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Plan and the
LTIP.

8.           Section 409A
Compliance.  This Agreement is intended to avoid, and not
otherwise be subject to, the income inclusion requirements, interest and penalty
taxes of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and other guidance
issued thereunder, and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with that
intent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there is a
failure to comply with Section 409A of the Code, the Corporation and the
Committee shall have the discretion to accelerate the time of payment of a Stock
Distribution or Cash Award, but only to the extent of the amount required to be
included in income as a result of such failure. In addition
to amendments permitted by Section 4 above, amendments to this Agreement, the
Plan and/or the LTIP may be made by the Corporation, without the Employee’s
consent, in order to ensure compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations and other guidance issued thereunder.

9.           Securities Law
Requirements.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
or the Plan to the contrary, the Corporation shall not be required to make any
Stock Distribution pursuant to this Award during such period that the
Corporation reasonably anticipates that such Stock Distribution will violate
federal securities laws or other applicable law.  The Corporation may
require the Recipient to furnish to the Corporation, prior to the issuance of
any shares of Common Stock hereunder, an agreement, in such form as the
Corporation may from time to time deem appropriate, in which the Recipient
represents that the shares acquired by him or her upon such exercise are being
acquired for investment and not with a view to the sale or distribution
thereof.

IN WITNESS HEREOF, this Agreement is
entered into as of the date first above written.

2009/2011
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
FOR
OFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES

Purpose

The
purpose of the 2009/2011 Performance Share Plan for Officers and Key Employees,
as amended (the “Plan”), is to provide greater incentive to officers and key
employees of the subsidiaries and affiliates of AMR Corporation (“AMR” or the
“Corporation”) to achieve the highest level of individual performance and to
meet or exceed specified goals during the time frame 2009 – 2011, which will
contribute to the success of the Corporation.

Definitions

For
purposes of the Plan, the following definitions will control:

“Affiliate”
is defined as a subsidiary of AMR or any entity that is designated by the
Committee as a participating employer under the Plan, provided that AMR directly
or indirectly owns at least 20% of the combined voting power of all classes of
stock of such entity.

“Board”
is defined as the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

“Committee”
is defined as the Compensation Committee, or its successor, of the
Board.

“Comparator
Group” is defined as the following nine U.S. based carriers including, AirTran
Airways, Inc., Alaska Air Group, Inc., AMR Corporation, Continental Airlines,
Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc., JetBlue Airways Corporation, Southwest Airlines Co.,
US Airways Group, Inc. and UAL Corporation.

 “Daily

Administration

The
Committee shall have authority to administer and interpret the Plan and any
Agreements thereunder, establish, amend and rescind administrative rules,
approve eligible participants, and take any other action necessary for the
proper and efficient operation of the Plan and any Agreements
thereunder.  The TSR metric will be determined based on an audit of
AMR’s TSR rank by the General Auditor of American Airlines, Inc.  A
summary of awards under the Plan shall be provided to the Board at its first
regular meeting following determination of any such awards.  The
awards will be paid on or about April 18, 2012, or such date in 2012 that the
award is approved for distribution by the Committee, but in no event later than
March 15, 2013.  The Committee may elect, at any time and from time to
time, in lieu of issuing all or any portion of the Award in Common Stock, to
make substitutions for such Common Stock, all to the effect that the employee
will receive cash or other marketable property of an equivalent
value.

The
distribution of any shares under this Plan and any Agreements thereunder is
subject to the Corporation having sufficient shares of stock in a stock plan to
make such a distribution. In the event the Corporation does not have sufficient
shares of stock in such a stock plan for the distribution contemplated by this
Plan, the Committee will have the authority and discretion to make substitutions
for such shares, all to the effect that the employee will receive cash or other
marketable property of a value equivalent to what the employee would have
received in a stock distribution.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Plan or any Agreement hereunder, (i) any obligation
of the Corporation to pay or distribute any shares under this Plan and any
Agreement hereunder is subject to and conditioned upon the Corporation having
sufficient stock in a shareholder-approved equity compensation plan to satisfy
all payments or distributions contemplated by this Plan, and (ii) any obligation
of the Corporation to pay or distribute cash or any other property under this
Plan or any Agreements hereunder is subject to and conditioned upon the
Corporation having the right to do so without violating the terms of any
covenant or agreement of the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries.

General

Neither
this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any
employee or participant the right to be retained in the employ of the
Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Corporation or to receive any proprietary
interest in the Corporation.

Nothing
in the Plan shall be deemed to give any employee any right, contractually or
otherwise, to participate in the Plan or in any benefits hereunder, other than
the right to receive an award as may have been expressly awarded by the
Committee subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement between the
Corporation and the employee and the Plan.  Until an employee receives
payment of cash and/or shares subject to his or her award, title to and
beneficial ownership of all benefits described in the Plan and any Agreement
thereunder shall at all times remain with the Corporation.

In the
event of any act of God, war, natural disaster, aircraft grounding, revocation
of operating certificate, terrorism, strike, lockout, labor dispute, work
stoppage, fire, epidemic or quarantine restriction, act of government, critical
materials shortage, or any other act beyond the control of the Corporation,
whether similar or dissimilar (each a “Force Majeure Event”), which Force
Majeure Event affects the Corporation or its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates, the
Committee, in its sole discretion, may (i) terminate or (ii) suspend, delay,
defer (for such period of time as the Committee may deem necessary), or
substitute any awards due currently or in the future under the Plan, including,
but not limited to, any awards that have accrued to the benefit of participants
but have not yet been paid, in any case to the extent permitted under Treasury
Regulation 1.409A-3(d) or successor guidance thereto.

In
consideration of the employee’s privilege to participate in the Plan, the
employee agrees: (i) not to disclose any trade secrets of, or other confidential
or restricted information of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to any
unauthorized party; (ii) not to make any unauthorized use of such trade secrets
or confidential or restricted information during or after his or her employment
with any Subsidiary of the Corporation; and (iii) not to solicit any then
current employees of any Subsidiary of the Corporation to join the employee at
his or her new place of employment after such employment has
terminated.  The failure by the employee to abide by the foregoing
obligations shall result in his or her award being forfeited in its
entirety.

The
Committee may amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan at any
time.

interests between such key employees and the Company’s stockholders, by offering
such key employees performance-based stock incentives and/or other equity
interests or equity-based incentives in the Company, as well as
performance-based incentives payable in cash.
 
 
For
purposes of the Plan, the following terms shall be defined as set forth
below:
 
 
(a) “Award”
means any award of a Stock Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock,

the Plan.  Award shall also include a cash incentive award payable in
accordance with Section 8(b).
 
 
(b) “Board”
means the Board of Directors of the Company.
 
 
(c) “Cause”
means a felony conviction of a Participant or the failure of a Participant to
contest prosecution for a felony, or a Participant’s willful misconduct or
dishonesty, any of which is directly and materially harmful to the business or
reputation of the Company or any Subsidiary.

in Control” means, unless otherwise defined, the happening of any of the
following:
 
 
(i) When
during any 12 month period any “person” as defined in Section 3(a)(9) of
the Exchange Act and as used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) thereof, including any
“group” within the meaning of both Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Treas.
Reg. §1.409A-3(i)(5)(v)(B), but excluding the Company, any Subsidiary or any
employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary
(including any trustee of such plan acting as trustee), directly or indirectly,
becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act, as amended from time to time), of securities of the Company representing
thirty percent (30%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then
outstanding securities;
 
 
(ii) When
during any 12 month period the individuals who, as of the beginning of such
period, constitute the Board (the “Incumbent Board”) cease for any reason to
constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any
individual becoming a director subsequent to the effective date of the Plan
whose election, or nomination for election by the Company’s stockholders, was
approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the
Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of
the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual (x) whose initial
assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election
contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or
threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other
than the Board and (y) who is a nominee
or other representative of the person(s) who conducted or threatened such
contest or solution or an affiliate thereof; or
 
 
(iii) Consummation
of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or other disposition of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the acquisition of assets
of another corporation (a “Business Combination”); provided; however, that a
Business Combination will not constitute a Change in Control if each of the
following three conditions are satisfied following such Business
Combination:
 
 
(A)           all
or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial
owners, respectively, of the then outstanding shares of Stock of the Company and
the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the
Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors immediately
prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly,
more than fifty percent (50%) of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of
common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case
may be, of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including,
without limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the
Company or all or substantially all of the Company’s assets either directly or
through one or more subsidiaries);
 
 
(B)           no
person (excluding any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or
such corporation resulting from such Business Combination) becomes, by reason of
such Business Combination, the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of
thirty percent (30%) or more of the combined voting power of the then
outstanding voting securities of such corporation, but disregarding for this
purpose any beneficial ownership held more than 12 months prior to the effective
time of such  Business Combination; and
 
 
(C)           at
least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation
resulting from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at
the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the
Board, providing for such Business Combination.

SECTION
2 Administration.
 
 
(a) Appointment
of Committee.  The Plan shall be administered by a committee of
not less than two members of the Board, who shall be appointed by, and serve at
the pleasure of, the Board. In selecting the members of the Committee, the Board
shall take into account the requirements for the members of the Committee to be
treated as “Outside Directors” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code
and “Non-Employee Directors” for purposes of Rule 16b-3, as promulgated
under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The functions of the Committee
specified in the Plan shall be exercised by the Board, if and to the extent that
no Committee exists which has the authority to so administer the Plan, or to the
extent that, at the time the action is to be taken, it is known that the
Committee is not comprised solely of Non-Employee Directors for purposes of
Rule 16b-3, as promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange
Act.
 
 
(b) Powers
Related to Awards.  The Committee shall have full authority to
grant, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, Awards to officers and other key
employees eligible under Section 4.  In addition to any other
authority that may be afforded to the Committee under the Plan, the Committee
shall have the authority:
 
 
(i) to select
the officers and other key employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to whom
Awards may from time to time be granted hereunder and, subject to the provisions
of Sections 3, 5 and 8, to determine the number of shares to be covered by
each such Award granted hereunder;
 
 
(ii) to
determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan,
of any Award granted hereunder (including, but not limited to, the share price
and any restriction or limitation, or any vesting acceleration or waiver of
forfeiture restrictions, regarding any Stock Option or other Award and/or the
shares of Stock relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the
Committee shall determine in its sole discretion);
 
 
(iii) to
determine whether, to what extent and under what circumstances Awards are to be
made, and operate, on a tandem basis vis-a-vis other Awards under the Plan
and/or awards outside of the Plan;
 
 
(iv) to
determine the terms and conditions pursuant to which an Award may vest on a pro
rata basis or be terminated; and
 
 
(v) to impose
conditions that may require the repayment, in whole or in part, of the
compensation or other benefit received by a Participant with respect to any
Award or Awards, to the extent that the compensation or benefit was derived from
the misconduct of the Participant or inaccuracies in the financial or
performance-related data upon which payment of any Award was made.
 
 
(c) Interpretative
Powers.  The Committee shall have the authority: to adopt and
modify such rules, guidelines and practices governing the Plan which are not
inconsistent with the terms of the Plan as it shall, from time to time, deem
advisable; to interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan and any Award
issued under the Plan (and any agreements relating thereto); and to otherwise
supervise the administration of the Plan.  Section 409A of the Code
applies to certain Awards under this Plan, and it is intended that all such
Awards shall be issued, administered, exercised and paid or transferred in
conformance therewith.  All decisions made by the Committee pursuant
to the provisions of the Plan shall be made in the Committee’s sole discretion
and shall be final and binding on all persons, including the Company and
Participants.  Accordingly, notwithstanding anything in Section 11 to
the contrary, the Committee shall have authority to amend or restate the terms
of a grant or award to preclude violation of Section 409A of the Code, without
the consent of the recipient thereof.
 
 
(d) Delegation.  The
Committee may appoint in writing such person or persons as it may deem necessary
or desirable to carry out any of the duties and responsibilities of the
Committee hereunder and may delegate to such person or persons in writing such
duties, and confer upon such person or persons in writing, such powers,
discretionary or otherwise, as the Committee may deem appropriate. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to applicable law, the
Committee may authorize from time to time the Chief Executive Officer and/or a
member of the Board or a committee of directors or officers of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or a subcommittee of members of the Committee to grant Awards
under this Plan to officers and other key employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries authorized or approved by the Committee (including grants of
individual Awards to officers and other key employees authorized or approved by
the Committee in a pool of Awards for a group of officers and/or other key
employees), subject to any conditions or limitations as the Committee may
establish; provided
that all Awards to executive officers of the Company shall be approved by
the Committee or a subcommittee thereof.
 
 
SECTION
3 Stock
Subject to Plan.
 
 
(a) Initial
Share Authorization.  The total number of shares of Stock
reserved and available for distribution under the Plan shall be 4,000,000
shares.  Shares issued under this Plan may consist, in whole or in
part, of authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares.  As
otherwise expressly provided in this Plan, Awards granted hereunder may be
payable in shares of Stock, cash or other property, or any combination thereof,
as determined by the Committee.
 
 
(b) Effect
of Forfeitures and Other Settlements.  Any shares of Stock
subject to a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, or to any Restricted
Stock, Deferred Stock or Performance Related Award, or a comparable award
granted under the Prior Plan, that, in either case, after the date this Plan is
adopted, is forfeited or otherwise terminated or settled, in whole or in part,
without a payment being made to the Participant in the form of Stock shall again
be available for distribution in connection with future Awards under the
Plan.  Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, upon
the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, regardless of whether granted on a
stand-alone basis or in tandem with any Stock Option, only the number of shares
of Stock actually issued in connection with the exercise of such Stock
Appreciation Right (and not the corresponding number of shares of Stock related
to the Stock Appreciation Right (or portion thereof) being exercised) shall be
treated as issued under the Plan and the remaining number of shares of Stock
related to such exercised Stock Appreciation Right (or portion thereof),
including the corresponding number of shares related to any tandem Stock Option
cancelled upon such exercise, shall again be available for issuance under the
Plan.
 
 
(c) Adjustments.  In
the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, stock
dividend, stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, other change in corporate
structure affecting the Stock, or other event or transaction of a similar nature
that results in a material change in the value of the Stock, such substitution
or adjustment shall be made in the aggregate number of shares reserved for
issuance under the Plan, in the number and option price or base price of shares
subject to outstanding Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights granted under
the Plan, and in the number of shares subject to other outstanding Awards
granted under the Plan as may be determined to be appropriate by the Committee,
in its sole discretion and in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, to
prevent the enhancement or diminution of the rights of any Participant hereunder
or in the benefits collectively available under the Plan for all Participants
and all persons eligible to be Participants, provided that the number of shares
subject to any Award shall always be a whole number.
 
 
SECTION
4 Eligibility.
 
 
Officers
and other key employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (but excluding
members of the Committee and any person who serves only as a director) who are
responsible for, or contribute to, the management, growth and/or profitability
of the business of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries are eligible for Awards
under the Plan.
 
 
SECTION
5 Stock
Options.
 
 
Stock
Options may be granted alone, in addition to, or in tandem with, other Awards
granted under the Plan.  Any Stock Option granted under the Plan shall
be in such form as the Committee may from time to time approve.  The
Committee shall have the authority to grant to any optionee Incentive Stock
Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options, or both types of Stock Options (in each
case with or without Stock Appreciation Rights); provided that, in no event
shall the number of shares of Stock subject to any Stock Options and/or Stock
Appreciation Rights granted to any employee during any calendar year exceed
750,000 shares, as such number may be adjusted pursuant to
Section 3(c).  In no event may any Stock Option or Stock
Appreciation Rights be granted in connection with, or conditioned upon, the
exercise of any previously granted Stock Option or Stock Appreciation
Rights.  Options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and
conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall
deem desirable:
 
 
(a) Option
Price.  The option price per share of Stock purchasable under a
Stock Option shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant;
provided, that such option price may not be less than the Fair Market Value of
the Stock at the time the Stock Option is granted.  Without the
express approval of the Company’s stockholders, except as otherwise provided in
Section 3(c), the Committee shall not be entitled to amend or otherwise modify
any Stock Option to lower the option price per share below the Fair Market Value
on the date of grant, or to issue any replacement Stock Option or similar Award
in exchange for a Stock Option with a higher exercise price.
 
 
(b) Option
Term.  The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the
Committee, but no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than ten
(10) years after the date the Option is granted.
 
 
(c) Exercisability.  Stock
Options shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and
conditions as shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant;
provided, however, that (i) except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan,
no Stock Option shall be exercisable prior to the first anniversary date of the
granting of the Option and (ii) after the date any Stock Option is granted, such
Stock Option may only become exercisable on a accelerated basis in the event of
a Change in Control or the Participant’s death, Disability or Retirement, as
provided in the Plan or otherwise determined by the Committee.
 
 
(d) Method
of Exercise.  Subject to whatever installment exercise
provisions apply under Section 5(c) and subject to whatever restrictions may be
imposed by the Company, Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part at
any time during the option period, by giving written notice of exercise to the
Company specifying the number of shares as to which the Stock Option is being
exercised.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, payment
of the option price may be made: (i) in cash or its equivalent;
(ii) by exchanging shares of Stock owned by the optionee (which are not the
subject of any pledge or other security interest); (iii) through an
arrangement with a broker approved by the Company whereby payment of the
exercise price is accomplished with the proceeds of the sale of Stock; or
(iv) by any combination of the foregoing, provided that the combined value
of all cash and cash equivalents paid and the Fair Market Value of any such
Stock so tendered to the Company, valued as of the time of such tender, is at
least equal to such option price.  In addition, the Committee may
permit any Stock Option to be exercised without payment of the purchase price,
in which case the Company’s sole obligation shall be to issue to the optionee
the same number of shares of Stock as would have been issued had such Stock
Option been Stock Appreciation Rights in respect of an identical number of
shares of Stock.  An optionee shall not have any rights to dividends
or other rights of a stockholder with respect to shares subject to the Option
until the optionee has exercised such Stock Option by paying for the shares
being exercised (or the Company has elected to net settle such Stock Option) in
accordance with this Section 5(d).
 
 
(e) Transferability
of Options.  Unless the Committee shall permit (on such terms
and conditions as it shall establish) an Option (other than an Incentive Stock
Option) to be transferred to a member of the Participant’s immediate family or
to a trust or similar vehicle solely for the benefit of the Participant and/or
such immediate family members, no Option shall be assignable or transferable
except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and except to the extent
required by law, no right or interest of any Participant shall be subject to any
lien, obligation or liability of the Participant.
 
 
(f) Termination
by Death, Disability and Retirement.  Subject to
Section 5(g), if an optionee’s employment by the Company and any Subsidiary
terminates by reason of death, Disability or Retirement, any Stock Option held
by such optionee may thereafter be exercised in accordance with the terms and
conditions established by the Committee.  In the event of termination
of employment by reason of death, Disability or Retirement, if an Incentive
Stock Option is exercised after the expiration of the exercise periods that
apply for purposes of Section 422 of the Code, such Stock Option will
thereafter be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
 
 
(g) Cause.  Upon
a Participant’s termination for Cause, any Stock Options held by such
Participant shall be immediately cancelled and may not thereafter be exercised,
even if exercisable on the date of such termination.
 
 
(h) Other
Termination.  If an optionee’s employment by the Company or any
Subsidiary terminates for any reason other than Cause, death, Disability or
Normal or Early Retirement, any unvested Stock Option shall thereupon terminate
and the Committee may permit an optionee up to 90 days following such
termination to exercise any Stock Options that are exercisable as of the date of
such termination.
 
 
(i) Incentive
Stock Options.  Anything in the Plan to the contrary
notwithstanding, no term of this Plan relating to Incentive Stock Options shall
be interpreted, amended or altered, nor shall any discretion or authority
granted under the Plan be so exercised, so as to disqualify the Plan under
Section 422 of the Code, or, without the consent of the optionee(s)
affected, to disqualify any Incentive Stock Option under such
Section 422.
 
 
SECTION
6 Stock
Appreciation Rights.
 
 
Stock
Appreciation Rights may be granted alone, in addition to, or in tandem with,
other Awards granted under the Plan. Any Stock Appreciation Right granted under
the Plan shall be in such form as the Committee may from time to time approve.
Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in conjunction with all or part of any
Stock Option granted under the Plan. In the case of a Non-Qualified Stock
Option, such rights may be granted either at or after the time of the grant of
such Stock Option. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, unless the
Participant otherwise consents, such rights may be granted only at the time of
grant of such Stock Option.  Stock Appreciation Rights shall be
subject to such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of
the Plan, as shall be determined from time to time by the Committee, including
the following:
 
 
(a) Exercisability.  Stock
Appreciation Rights shall be exercisable at such time and subject to such
conditions as the Committee shall specify, except that any Stock Appreciation
Right granted in tandem with a Stock Option (or portion thereof) shall be
exercisable only at such time or times and to the extent that the Stock Options
to which they relate shall be exercisable, including in the event of the
termination of the Participant’s employment, in accordance with the provisions
of Section 5 of the Plan.  Any Stock Appreciation Right granted
on a stand-alone basis shall be subject to the same rules regarding
exercisability (including those pertaining to the impact of termination of
employment and the periods following termination of employment) that apply to
Stock Options under Section 5.
 
 
(b) Shares
Delivered on Exercise.  A grantee of a Stock Appreciation Right
shall not have any rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with
respect to shares subject to the Stock Appreciation Right until the grantee has
exercised the Stock Appreciation Right.  Upon the exercise of a Stock
Appreciation Right, a grantee shall be entitled to receive an amount in shares
of Stock (or, solely to the extent determined by the Committee, cash) equal in
value to the excess of the Fair Market Value (at the time of exercise) of one
share of Stock over the base price per share specified with respect to the Stock
Appreciation Right, multiplied by the number of shares in respect of which the
Stock Appreciation Right shall have been exercised. When payment is to be made
in shares, the number of shares to be paid shall be calculated on the basis of
the Fair Market Value of the shares at the time of
exercise.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6(b) to the
contrary, the base price in respect of any Stock Appreciation Right shall not be
less than the Fair Market Value of the Stock at the time the Stock Appreciation
Right is granted, or in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem
with a Stock Option, the Fair Market Value at the time the related Stock Option
was granted.  Without the express approval of the Company’s
stockholders, except as otherwise provided in Section 3(c), the Committee shall
not be entitled to amend or otherwise modify any Stock Appreciation Right to
lower the exercise price below the Fair Market Value applicable at the date of
grant, or to issue any replacement Stock Appreciation Right or similar award in
exchange for a Stock Appreciation Right with a higher exercise
price.
 
 
(c) Exercise
of SARs.  A Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised by a
grantee, subject to Section 6(b), in accordance with the procedures
established by the Committee from time to time for such purposes. Upon such
exercise, the grantee shall be entitled to receive an amount determined in the
manner prescribed in Section 6(b).
 
 
(d) Exercise
of Tandem Option.  A Stock Appreciation Right or applicable
portion thereof granted with respect to a given Stock Option shall terminate and
no longer be exercisable upon the termination or exercise of the related Stock
Option (and similarly the related Stock Option shall no longer be exercisable
upon the exercise or termination of the related Stock Appreciation Right),
subject to such provisions as the Committee may specify at grant where a Stock
Appreciation Right is granted with respect to less than the full number of
shares covered by a related Stock Option.
 
 
(e) Transferability.  Stock
Appreciation Rights shall be transferable only to the extent that Stock Options
may be transferable under Section 5(e) of the Plan.
 
 
SECTION
7 Restricted
Stock and Deferred Stock.
 
 
(a) Administration.  Restricted
Stock or Deferred Stock may be issued either alone, in addition to, or in tandem
with, other Awards granted under the Plan and/or awards made outside of the
Plan. The Committee shall determine the eligible persons to whom, and the time
or times at which, grants of Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock will be made,
the number of shares to be awarded, the price (if any) to be paid by the
recipient, the time or times within which such Awards may be subject to
forfeiture, and all other terms and conditions of the Awards.  The
Committee may condition the grant of Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock upon the
attainment of specified Performance Criteria or such other factors as the
Committee may determine, in its sole discretion. The provisions of Restricted
Stock or Deferred Stock Awards need not be the same with respect to each
recipient.  The shares of Restricted Stock and any Deferred Stock
awarded pursuant to this Section 7 shall be subject to the following terms
and conditions:
 
 
(b) Restriction
Period.  Subject to the provisions of this Plan and the Award
agreement, during a period set by the Committee commencing with the date of such
Award (the “Restriction Period”), the Participant shall not be permitted to
sell, transfer, pledge or assign shares of Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock
awarded under the Plan.  Where the Restriction Period will lapse or
expire based on service, the Restriction Period shall be at least three
(3) years, provided that such Restriction Period may lapse ratably over
such minimum three-year period and may be waived in the event of death,
Disability, Retirement or a Change in Control.  Where the Restriction
Period will lapse or expire based on Performance Criteria, as provided in
Section 8, the Restriction Period shall be at least one (1) year, but may
be waived in the event of death, Disability, Retirement or a Change in
Control.  Subject to the two immediately preceding sentences, the
Committee, in its sole discretion, may provide for the lapse of any restrictions
imposed on any Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock Award in installments and may
accelerate or waive such restrictions in whole or in part, based on service,
Performance Criteria and/or such other factors as the Committee may determine,
in its sole discretion.
 
 
(c) Dividend
Equivalents on Deferred Stock.  The Committee shall determine
whether an amount equivalent to any dividends declared on a share of Stock will
be credited with respect to an Award of Deferred Stock and, if so, when such
dividend equivalents will be paid and whether they will be paid in (or valued by
reference to) cash, Restricted Stock or additional Deferred Stock, in any case
in compliance with Section 409A of the Code.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, except to the extent that a stock, property or extraordinary dividend
would require an adjustment to such an Award pursuant to Section 3(c), no
dividend equivalents shall be payable in respect of any Performance Related
Stock Award that has not become vested as of the record date of the
corresponding dividend payable on the Stock.
 
 
(d) Delivery.  Promptly
after the lapse of the Restriction Period (unless and to the extent that the
Committee decides to settle the Award in cash), if and when the Restriction
Period expires without a prior forfeiture of the Restricted Stock subject to
such Restriction Period, the Company shall record on its books and records, in a
manner generally consistent with its then current procedures for recording stock
ownership, the Participant’s ownership of an appropriate number of unrestricted
shares of Stock.  At the expiration of the Restriction Period with
respect to any Award of Deferred Stock, the Company shall record on its books
and records, in a manner generally consistent with its then current procedures
for recording stock ownership, the Participant’s ownership of a number of shares
of Stock equal to the shares covered by the Deferred Stock Award; provided,
that, the Committee may determine, at or after grant, whether, and to what
extent, to settle Deferred Stock in cash.
 
 
SECTION
8 Performance
Related Awards.
 
 
(a) Performance
Objectives.  Notwithstanding anything else contained in the
Plan to the contrary, the Committee may, at the time of grant, provide that any
Award of Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock shall become vested, if at all, upon
the determination by the Committee that performance objectives established by
the Committee have been attained, in whole or in part (a “Performance Related
Stock Award”).  In addition, the Committee may grant dollar
denominated awards to any Participant, the vesting of which shall be subject to
the determination by the Committee that performance objectives established by
the Committee shall have been satisfied, in whole or in part (a “Performance
Related Incentive Award”).  The performance objectives upon which any
Performance Related Award shall be based shall be determined over a measurement
period or periods established by the Committee (which period or periods shall
not be less than one (1) year).  The Committee shall determine
the performance objectives that must be satisfied with respect to any
Performance Related Award from among the following criteria, which may be
determined solely by reference to the performance of: (i) the Company;
(ii) a Subsidiary; or (iii) a division or unit of any of the foregoing
or based on comparative performance of any of the foregoing relative to past
performance or to other companies: (A) return on equity; (B) total
shareholder return; (C) primary or fully diluted earnings per share; (D) EBITDA;
(E) revenues; (F) cash flows, revenues and/or earnings relative to other
parameters (e.g., net or gross assets); (G) operating income;
(H) return on investment; (I) changes in the value of the Stock;
(J) return on assets; (K) operational performance (including on-time
performance); (L) customer satisfaction; and (M) employee surveys (the
“Performance Criteria”).  In addition to the performance conditions
established pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Committee may
further condition the vesting of any Performance Related Award on achieving such
additional performance conditions of whatever nature that the Committee deems
appropriate.  Excluding Stock Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights
granted hereunder, the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be subject to
any such Performance Related Stock Award granted to any key employee in any
calendar year shall not exceed 750,000 shares, as such number may be adjusted
pursuant to Section 3(c); provided that, based on the level of achievement
of the performance objectives, the number of shares of Stock issuable in respect
of any Performance Related Stock Award upon achievement of the applicable
performance conditions may be up to twice the number of shares initially
granted.  The maximum initial dollar value of any Performance Related
Incentive Award granted to any key employee may not exceed $3,000,000; provided
that, based on the level of achievement of the performance objectives, the
actual amount payable in respect of such Performance Related Stock Award upon
achievement of the applicable performance conditions may be twice the initial
dollar value.
 
 
(b) Annual
Incentive Compensation.  The Committee may, in addition to the
Performance Related Awards described above, pay cash amounts under the Plan or
any other plan or arrangement approved by the Committee and designated as
complying with this Section 8(b), provided such other plan or arrangement is in
conformity with the provisions of this Section 8(b), to any officer of the
Company or any Subsidiary who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act upon the achievement, in whole or in part, of
performance goals or objectives established in writing by the Committee with
respect to such performance periods as the Committee shall determine. Any such
goals or objectives shall be based on one or more of the Performance
Criteria.  Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the
contrary, the maximum amount of any such cash payment to any single officer with
respect to any calendar year shall not exceed $3,000,000.
 
 
(c) Interpretation.  Notwithstanding
anything else contained in the Plan to the contrary, to the extent required to
so qualify any Performance Related Award to any officer who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as other performance
based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code,
the Committee shall not be entitled to exercise any discretion otherwise
authorized under the Plan (such as the right to accelerate vesting without
regard to the achievement of the relevant performance objectives) with respect
to such Performance Related Award if the ability to exercise such discretion (as
opposed to the exercise of such discretion) would cause such Award to fail to
qualify as other performance based compensation.
 
 
SECTION
9 Stock
Based Awards.
 
 
(a) Stock
Based Awards.  The Committee
may grant other types of equity-based or equity-related awards (“Stock-Based
Awards”) not otherwise described by the terms of this Plan (including the grant
or offer for sale of unrestricted Stock) in such amounts and subject to such
terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine; provided, however, that
in no event may the aggregate number of shares subject to Stock-Based Awards
granted under the Plan exceed five percent of the Shares available for issuance
under Section 3(a).  Such Stock-Based Awards may be granted as an
inducement to enter the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary or in
satisfaction of any obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary to an officer or
other key employee, whether pursuant to this Plan, the Prior Plan or otherwise,
that would otherwise have been payable in cash or in respect of any award under
the Prior Plan.  Such Stock-Based Awards may entail the transfer of
actual Stock, or payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of
Stock and may include, without limitation, Awards designed to comply with or
take advantage of the applicable local laws of jurisdictions other than the
United States.
 
 
(b) Termination
of Service.  The Committee
shall specify the extent to which the Participant shall have the right to
receive Stock-Based Awards following termination of the Participant’s employment
with the Company and its Subsidiaries.  Such provisions need not be
uniform among all Stock-Based Awards, and may reflect distinctions based on the
reasons for such termination.
 
 
(c) Transferability.  Except as the
Committee shall otherwise specify at or after grant, Stock-Based Awards may not
be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated,
other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and during the
Participant’s lifetime only by the Participant.
 
 
SECTION
10 Change
in Control Provisions.
 
 
Notwithstanding
the provisions of Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, unless otherwise specified in an
Award agreement, in the event of a Change in Control:
 
 
(a) Any Stock
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights awarded under the Plan not previously
exercisable and vested shall become fully exercisable and vested;
 
 
(b) The
restrictions and deferral limitations applicable to any Restricted Stock,
Deferred Stock, Performance Related Awards or Stock-Based Awards, in each case
to the extent not already vested under the Plan, shall lapse and such shares and
Awards shall be deemed fully vested, with any Performance Criteria shall be
deemed met at target; and
 
 
(c) The value
of all outstanding Awards to the extent vested may at the sole discretion of the
Committee at or after grant but prior to any Change in Control, be cashed out,
based on the then current Fair Market Value, as of the date such Change in
Control is determined to have occurred or such other date prior to the Change in
Control as the Committee may determine.
 
 
SECTION
11 Amendments
and Termination.
 
 
The Board
may amend, alter, or discontinue the Plan, but no amendment, alteration, or
discontinuation shall be made which would (i) without stockholder approval, (A)
increase the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan, (B) modify
the requirements for participation under the Plan, (C) otherwise enhance the
benefits that may be provided to Participants under the Plan, including by
enhancing the ability of the Committee to waive restrictions on Restricted Stock
and Deferred Stock, or (D) authorize the repricing of outstanding Stock Options
or Stock Appreciation Rights, or (ii) impair the rights of a Participant under
an Award theretofore granted, without the Participant’s consent.  Any
amendment of the Plan shall be subject to stockholder approval to extent
required under the immediately preceding sentence, applicable law or the
applicable rules of any exchange or trading system on which the Stock is listed
to trade.  Subject to the express terms and conditions of the Plan,
the Committee may amend the terms of any Stock Option or other Award theretofore
granted, prospectively or retroactively, provided that no such amendment shall
impair the rights of any holder without the holder’s consent.
 
 
SECTION
12 General
Provisions.
 
 
(a) Compliance
with Securities Laws.  The Committee
may require each person purchasing shares pursuant to a Stock Option or other
Award under the Plan to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that
such person is acquiring the shares without a view to distribution thereof. The
certificates for such shares may include any legend which the Committee deems
appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer.  All certificates
for shares of Stock or other securities delivered under the Plan shall be
subject to such stock-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee
may deem advisable under the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Stock is
then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law, and the
Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to
make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
 
 
(b) Other
Compensation Arrangements.  Nothing
contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional
compensation arrangements, subject to stockholder approval if such approval is
required, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable
only in specific cases.
 
 
(c) No Right
to Employment.  The adoption of
the Plan shall not confer upon any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary any
right to continued employment with the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may
be, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company or a
Subsidiary to terminate the employment of any of its employees at any
time.
 
 
(d) Tax
Withholding.  Except as the Participant and the Company may
otherwise agree, no later than the date as of which an amount first becomes
includible in the gross income of the Participant for federal income tax
purposes with respect to any Award under the Plan, the Participant shall pay to
the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee regarding the
payment of, any federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be
withheld with respect to such amount. Unless otherwise determined by the
Committee, withholding obligations may be satisfied by settling an Award, in
relevant part, by the payment of cash to the relevant tax authorities in lieu of
issuing (or in cancellation of) Stock, including Stock that is part of the Award
that gives rise to the withholding requirement. The obligations of the Company
under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the
right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the
Participant.
 
 
(e) Deferral
of Compensation.  Subject to compliance with the applicable
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, permit a Participant to postpone the delivery of Stock under any
Award under the Plan upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall
determine.
 
 
(f) Governing
Law.  The Plan and all
Awards made and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
 
SECTION
13 Term
of Plan.
 
 
Subject
to stockholder approval of the Plan at the annual meeting of the Corporation’s
stockholders in 2009, the Plan shall be effective as of May 20,
2009.  No Award shall be granted pursuant to the Plan on or after the
tenth anniversary of the date of stockholder approval, but Awards granted prior
to such tenth anniversary may extend beyond that date, in accordance with the
terms of such Awards.

I, Gerard
J. Arpey, certify that:





1.  


I
      have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of AMR
      Corporation;









2.  


Based
      on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a
      material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
      statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
      were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
      report;









3.  


Based
      on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information
      included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the
      financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
      registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this
      report;









4.  


The
      registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
      establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
      defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal
      control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
      13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and
  have:









(a)  


Designed
      such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
      controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure
      that material information relating to the registrant, including its
      consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
      entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
      prepared;









(b)  


Designed
      such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal
      control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
      reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
      purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
      principles;









(c)  


Evaluated
      the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures
      and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of
      the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period
      covered by this report based on such evaluation;
  and









(d)  


Disclosed
      in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over
      financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent
      fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an
      annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
      materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
      reporting; and









5.  


The
      registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on
      our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting,
      to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
      board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
      functions):









(a)  


All
      significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
      operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
      reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record,
      process, summarize and report financial information;
  and









(b)  


Any
      fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
      employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control
      over financial reporting.
