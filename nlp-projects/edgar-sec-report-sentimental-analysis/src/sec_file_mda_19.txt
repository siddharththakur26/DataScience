item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes included in this quarterly report on form 10 q, as well as the consolidated financial statements, related footnotes and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the company's annual report on form 10 k a for the year ended december 31, 1998. acquisitions on march 30, 1998, the company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired approximately 81 of the total number of then outstanding shares of common stock of coleman from a subsidiary of macandrews forbes m f , in exchange for 14,099,749 shares of the company's common stock and approximately 160 million in cash. in addition, the company assumed approximately 1,016 million in debt. immediately thereafter, as a result of the exercise of coleman employee stock options, sunbeam's indirect beneficial ownership of coleman decreased to approximately 79 of the total number of the outstanding shares of coleman common stock. the company's agreement for the acquisition of the remaining publicly held coleman shares pursuant to a merger transaction provides that the remaining coleman shareholders will receive o approximately 6.7 million shares of sunbeam common stock 0.5677 of a share for each outstanding coleman share and, o approximately 87 million in cash 6.44 for each outstanding coleman share and the cash out of unexercised coleman employee stock options for an amount equal to the difference between 27.50 per share and the exercise price of such options . the company expects to complete the coleman merger during the fourth quarter of 1999 or early in the first quarter of 2000, although there can be no assurance that the merger will occur during that time. see the discussion below under the heading issuance of warrants to m f for information regarding the settlement claims relating to the coleman acquisition, the terms of which provide for the issuance at the time of the merger of warrants to purchase up to 4.98 million shares of sunbeam's common stock at 7 per share. on april 6, 1998, the company completed the cash acquisitions of first alert, a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and signature brands, a leading manufacturer of consumer and professional products. the first alert and the signature brands acquisitions were valued at approximately 182 million including 133 million of cash and 49 million of assumed debt and approximately 255 million reflecting cash paid, including the required retirement or defeasance of debt , respectively. the acquisitions were recorded under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the financial position and results of operations of each acquired entity are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. the purchase prices of the acquired entities have been allocated to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair values determined by independent appraisals at the dates of acquisition. 24 non recurring charges consolidated operating results for 1999 and 1998 were impacted by a number of largely non recurring charges. operating income, adjusted for these items, is summarized in the following table and succeeding narrative. combined historical three months ended nine months ended results nine months ended

results of coleman, signature brands and first alert from the beginning of 1998 to their respective acquisition dates. the combined historical results do not include pro forma purchase accounting adjustments including those relating to the amortization of the purchase price of these acquisitions. certain amounts included in the historical results of the acquired companies have been reclassified to conform to the company's presentation. presentation of these combined results is made to enhance comparability between the periods presented and such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the combined results that would have occurred had these acquisitions been consummated at the beginning of 1998. provision for inventory in the second and third quarters of 1998, the company recorded charges totaling 86.2 million as a result of the following o inventories were built during 1997 and the first half of 1998 in anticipation of 1998 sales volumes which did not materialize. as a result, it has been and will continue to be necessary to dispose of some portions of excess inventories at amounts less than cost. accordingly, during 1998, when the facts and circumstances were known that such sales volume would not materialize, the company recorded 48.6 million in charges of which 46.4 million and 2.2 million were recorded in the second and third quarters, respectively to properly state this inventory at the lower of cost or market. this inventory primarily related to certain appliances, grills and grill accessories. o a charge of 11.0 million was recorded during the second quarter of 1998 for excess inventories for raw material and work in process that will not be used due to outsourcing the production of breadmakers, toasters, and some other appliances. 25 o in the second quarter of 1998, the company made the decision to exit certain product lines, primarily air and water filtration products and eliminate some stock keeping units sku's within existing product lines, primarily relating to appliances, grills and grill accessories. as a result of this decision, a 26.6 million charge was recorded during the second quarter of 1998 to properly state this inventory at the lower of cost or market. these charges to record excess inventories at the lower of cost or market were based upon management's best estimate of net realizable value. see note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. in addition to the charge taken in 1998, the excess and obsolete inventory referenced above has impacted the company's operating results in several ways, with two primary effects. first, gross margins have been impacted by sales, at below normal prices, of obsolete inventory into non traditional channels and excess inventory into traditional channels. in addition, due to the high levels of excess inventory at the end of 1998, the company's usage of its manufacturing facilities has been lower than normal, resulting in lower fixed cost absorption, which in turn, reduced gross margins in 1999. asset impairment during 1998, management made decisions to outsource or discontinue a substantial number of products previously made by the company principally breadmakers, toasters and certain other appliances, air and water filtration products and the elimination of some sku's within existing product lines, primarily relating to appliances, grills and grill accessories . as a result, some facilities and equipment held by the company at such time are either no longer used or are utilized in a significantly different manner. accordingly, a charge of 29.6 million was recorded in cost of goods sold to write some of these assets down to their estimated fair market value. subsequent to the decisions made in conjunction with the acquisitions, management decided to discontinue certain sku's within product lines, principally generators, compressors and propane cylinders. as a result, in the third quarter of 1998, the company recorded in cost of goods sold an additional provision for impairment of fixed assets of 3.1 million in an acquired entity relating to assets taken out of service for which there was no remaining value. these assets are expected to be substantially disposed of by december 31, 1999. see note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. purchase accounting the company recorded the 1998 acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. in accordance with this accounting method, inventory pertaining to the acquisitions was recorded at fair value. the fair value of the inventory exceeded the book value reflected on the balance sheets of the acquired companies as of the respective acquisition dates. the excess of the fair value of inventory over its pre acquisition book value was recorded in cost of sales as the inventory was sold. the non recurring impact of this purchase accounting adjustment was 20.5 million and 7.6 million in the second and third quarters of 1998, respectively. issuance of warrants to m f on august 12, 1998, the company announced that, following investigation and negotiation conducted by a special committee of the board of directors consisting of four outside directors not affiliated with m f, the company had entered into a settlement agreement with a subsidiary of m f pursuant to which the company was released from certain threatened claims of m f and its subsidiaries arising from the coleman acquisition and m f agreed to provide certain management personnel and assistance to the company in exchange for the issuance to the m f subsidiary of a warrant expiring august 24, 2003 to purchase up to 23 million shares of the company's common stock at a cash exercise price of 7.00 per share, subject to anti dilution adjustments. the company concluded that the agreement to issue this warrant did not result in a new measurement date for the purposes of determining the purchase price for coleman and accounted for the issuance of this warrant in the third quarter of 1998 as a cost of settling a potential claim. accordingly, a 70.0 million non cash sg a expense was recorded in the third quarter of 1998, based upon a valuation performed as of august 1998 using facts existing at that time. the valuation was conducted by an independent consultant engaged by the special committee of the board of directors. former employees' deferred compensation severance on february 20, 1998, the company entered into new three year employment agreements with its then chairman and chief executive officer and two other senior officers of the company. the new employment agreements provided for, among other items, the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock and the forfeiture of unvested restricted stock that had 26 been granted under the executives' prior employment agreements, new restricted stock grants and options to purchase common shares. in addition, the new employment agreements provided for income tax gross ups with respect to any tax assessed on the restricted stock grants and acceleration of vesting of restricted stock. total compensation expense recognized in the first quarter of 1998 related to these items was approximately 31 million. the company also recognized approximately 3.8 million of severance for former employees in the third quarter of 1998. see note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. year 2000 and systems initiatives expenses see year 2000 readiness disclosure within this item ii management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . restatement related expenses on june 30, 1998, the company announced that the audit committee was initiating a review into the accuracy of the company's prior financial statements. the audit committee's review was completed and, as a result of its findings, the company was required to restate its previously issued consolidated financial statements for 1996 and 1997 and the first quarter of 1998. in connection with the restatement efforts, the company incurred 10.8 million of costs in the third quarter of 1998 principally representing legal and accounting and auditing costs of 6.1 million and 4.7 million, respectively. office relocation expense in 1998, the company made the decision to relocate the corporate headquarters and exit several existing building leases in connection with a plan to consolidate office space. accordingly, a charge of 4.0 million was recorded in the third quarter primarily related to lease termination fees and cancellation penalties. three months ended september 30, 1999 compared to three months ended september 30, 1998 consolidated net sales for the three months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998 were 601.6 million and 496.0 million respectively, an increase of 105.6 million or approximately 21 . this increase was driven primarily by the outdoor leisure group where net sales increased 62.5 million to 221.1 million in the third quarter of 1999. this increase was predominately driven by strong retail replenishment demand of outdoor recreation products and powermate registered trademark generators aggregating approximately 58 million . the increase in outdoor recreation products and powermate registered trademark generators is believed to be partially attributable to heightened consumer sensitivity to the need for emergency preparedness. this increased sensitivity is believed to be reflective of a combination of factors including weather conditions and year 2000 considerations. outdoor cooking product net sales increases in the 1999 period as compared to the third quarter of 1998 accounted for the balance of the sales increase. the increase in outdoor cooking product sales was largely the result of strong retail conditions. household net sales increased 20.7 million to 239.9 million in 1999. after adjusting for the company's estimate of the effect of reduced shipments in the year ago quarter to allow trade inventories to return to normal levels, which impacted all segments, but which was most significant for the household segment. household segment sales were essentially flat as compared to the third quarter in 1998. within the household segment, net sales of personal care and health products increased as a result of a strengthening retail environment largely offset by decreases in sales of appliances and timing of first alert product sales. international net sales increased 25.3 million to 139.0 million. this increase in net sales was largely driven by improved net sales in canada of approximately 12 million, resulting predominantly from strong retail demand for powermate registered trademark . net sales increases in europe, japan and asia pacific, resulting primarily from increased sales of outdoor recreation products and reduced levels of sales returns, account for the remainder of the increase in international net sales. gross margin for the third quarter in 1999 was 158.8 million or 91.4 million higher than the comparable period in 1998. excluding the effects of 1998 non recurring items, as summarized above under non recurring charges , gross margin was 80.3 million in the third quarter of 1998. as a percentage of net sales, gross margin improved to approximately 26 in the third quarter of 1999 as compared to the third quarter 1998 gross margin of approximately 14 and 1998 adjusted gross margin of approximately 16 . three quarters of the increase in gross margin dollars was generated through higher sales volumes, volume related manufacturing fixed cost absorption improvements and improvements in manufacturing performance driven by the outdoor leisure group which contributed over 50 of the 27 improvement in total gross margin dollars in the third quarter of 1999. decreases in customer allowances, which are deductions from gross sales to arrive at net sales, along with improvements in the product sales mix accounted for the remainder of the improvement in gross margin in the third quarter. sg a expense in the third quarter of 1999 was 154.5 million, representing a 32.4 decrease over the same period in the prior year. excluding the effects of non recurring items, as summarized above under non recurring charges , sg a expense for 1999 was approximately 12 million higher than the same period in 1998. the increase in sg a expense was driven predominantly by higher net sales during the quarter and costs related to additional personnel, which together account for approximately 20 million. approximately two thirds of this increase is attributable to higher levels of selling and administrative costs primarily in the outdoor leisure and international segments driven by increased net sales. the remaining increase in sg a expense is primarily related to additional personnel, largely as a result of the company building staffing levels to support future growth, a process that commenced in the third quarter of 1998. in addition, sg a expense in 1999 includes costs associated with certain redundant operations resulting from the company's 1998 acquisitions which operations the company is integrating, as well as the decision to bring in house certain functions that had previously been outsourced. the company is in the process of fully integrating certain of these functions and expects that when this process has been completed consolidated sg a expense for these functions will be reduced. partially offsetting these increases in sg a expense are certain 1998 expenses which did not reoccur in 1999. these 1998 expenses include increases associated with restructuring reserve at coleman approximately 7 million and higher bad debt expense approximately 3 million . consolidated operating results for the third quarters of 1999 and 1998, were a profit of 4.3 million in 1999 and a loss of 161.0 million in 1998. operating results, as adjusted, were a profit of 9.5 million and a loss of 57.4 million in the third quarter of 1999 and 1998, respectively. this change resulted from the factors discussed above. interest expense, net in the third quarter of 1999 was 48.3 million as compared to 42.7 million in the same period in the prior year. approximately 40 of this increase is attributable to higher levels of borrowings during the third quarter of 1999. the increased level of borrowings was attributable to capital expenditures since the third quarter of 1998. the balance of the increase was driven by the amortization of the loan commitment fee approximately 1 million the company is obligated to pay under the terms of the new credit facility and the debenture expense related to liquidated damages payable to debenture holders approximately 1 million . see notes 3 and 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. other income, net of 5.2 million for the third quarter of 1999 included a gain of approximately 4 million relating to the sale of the mexico city facility. this gain was partially offset by losses from other miscellaneous asset sales of approximately 1.5 million. the balance of other income, net in 1999 resulted from favorable foreign exchange rates, primarily from the company's operations in japan. other income, net of 11.0 million for the third quarter of 1998 included 8.0 million from the settlement of a lawsuit. the balance of other income, net in 1999 resulted from favorable foreign exchange rates, primarily from mexico. the minority interest reported for the third quarter of 1999 and 1998 relates to the minority interest held in coleman by public shareholders. tax expense recorded in the third quarter of 1999 3.7 million related primarily to taxes on foreign income. income taxes in the third quarter of 1998 reflect tax benefits on earnings of foreign operations. no net tax benefit was recorded due to the company's u.s. losses in either year as it is management's assessment that the company cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets resulting from these losses would be realized through future taxable income. on july 12, 1999, the company acquired 3,000,000 shares of a newly created series of coleman voting preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 31 million. these shares, together with the shares of coleman common stock the company owns, enable sunbeam to exercise 80.01 of the total voting power of coleman's outstanding capital stock as of july 12, 1999. this class of preferred stock was created by coleman and acquired by the company in order to enable coleman and the company to file consolidated federal income tax returns, and in certain jurisdictions, consolidated state income tax returns, prior to the consummation of the coleman merger. in connection with the issuance of the shares of preferred stock, the company entered into a tax sharing agreement with coleman, pursuant to which coleman will pay to sunbeam amounts equal to the federal and state income taxes that would have been payable by coleman had coleman not been included in the consolidated income tax return of the company. the net proceeds from the issuance of the shares by coleman of its voting preferred stock to the company were used by coleman to make a partial 28 repayment of loans outstanding from sunbeam under the intercompany note. see note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. on november 9, 1999, the company announced a plan to divest eastpak and also plans to divest certain non essential assets. proceeds from these assets sales are estimated to be 200 million and will be primarily used to pay down debt. nine months ended september 30, 1999 compared to nine months ended september 30, 1998 net sales for the nine months ended september 30, 1999 and 1998 were 1,786.4 million and 1,322.1 million respectively, an increase of 464.3 million. results for the nine months ended september 30, 1998 include coleman, signature brands and first alert from their respective acquisition dates. after adjusting 1998 sales to include sales of the acquired companies for the periods from the beginning of 1998 through the respective dates of acquisition, combined historical net sales would be 1,624.0 million. 1999 net sales increased approximately 162 million or approximately 10 over 1998 combined historical net sales. information that adjusts for the results of the acquisitions prior to the actual acquisition dates the combined historical information is provided for informational purposes only and is to enhance comparability of the period presented. this information is not necessarily indicative of what the combined results would have been had these acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented or the results for any future period. the increase in net sales is driven by the outdoor leisure group which had an increase of approximately 123 million in 1999 as compared to the combined historical net sales in the same period in the prior year. this increase over combined historical net sales was largely due to sales of outdoor recreation products and powermate registered trademark generators. the higher level of sales of these products is believed to be partially attributable to heightened consumer sensitivity to the need for emergency preparedness. the company believes that this heightened sensitivity is reflective of a combination of factors, including weather conditions and year 2000 considerations. household net sales in 1999 increased approximately 11 million compared to 1998 combined historical net sales. the company believes that the decrease in shipments in the prior year in order to allow trade inventories to return to a normal level is primarily responsible for this increase. this factor affects the year to year comparisons for each of the operating groups. adjusting for the effect on 1998 of loading, the company believes that household net sales in 1999 were approximately the same as in the prior year. within the household segment, net sales of personal care products increased as a result of a strengthening retail environment largely offset by decreases in sales of appliances. international net sales in 1999 increased 30.3 million over 1998 combined historical net sales. higher sales in canada, europe and japan resulted predominantly from strong retail demand of powermate registered trademark and outdoor recreation products. this increase was partially offset by the impact of weak economic conditions in latin america. gross margin for the first nine months of 1999 was 452.3 million or 403.6 million higher than the comparable period in 1998. adjusting for the combined results of the acquired companies and excluding the effects of 1998 non recurring items, which are summarized above under the heading non recurring charges , gross margin for the first nine months of 1999 increased approximately 182 million over the 1998 combined historical gross margin. as a percentage of net sales, gross margin improved to approximately 25 in the first nine months of 1999 as compared to approximately 4 in the 1998 period. the gross margin percentage for the 1998 period adjusted for the non recurring charges and for the effect of the acquired companies was approximately 17 of combined historical net sales. the household group contributed approximately 30 of the 1999 gross margin improvement over the 1998 combined historical gross margin. the improvement in the household group's gross margin resulted primarily from lower sales deduction rates, improved manufacturing processes and controls, additional sales volume, and improved product mix. the outdoor leisure group contributed approximately 50 of the 1999 gross margin improvement over the 1998 combined historical gross margin. approximately 80 of the improvement in the outdoor leisure group's gross margin resulted from additional volume and related improved manufacturing overhead absorption, as well as improvements in manufacturing. the balance of the increase resulted from improved product mix. the international group contributed approximately 20 of the 1999 gross margin improvement over 1998 combined historical gross margin. approximately 40 of the improvement in the international group's gross margin resulted from the shut down of the mexico city manufacturing facility which had experienced high material usage costs and employee benefit costs in the prior year. the remaining improvement resulted from increased sales volume, a lower level of product returns and improved product mix. sg a expense for the first nine months of 1999 was 449.3 million, an increase of 8.9 million or 2.0 over the same period in the prior year. after adjusting 1998 sg a expense to include the acquired companies' sg a expense for the period from the beginning of 1998 through the respective dates of acquisition 100.9 million , combined historical 29 sg a expense was 541.3 million. since the combined historical 1998 sg a expenses were derived by adding the acquired companies' pre acquisition period costs to the reported nine months' results of sunbeam, the combined historical sg a expenses include 30.4 million of amortization of intangibles expense representing both pre and post acquisition periods, as well as approximately 12 million of transaction costs incurred by the acquired companies relating to them being purchased by sunbeam. excluding these costs and the effects of 1998 non recurring charges, as described above under non recurring charges , adjusted 1998 sg a expenses were approximately 378 million. excluding amortization of intangibles expense of 38.4 million for the first nine months of 1999 and the non recurring charges, as described above under non recurring charges , adjusted 1999 sg a costs were 392.2 million, an increase of approximately 14 million over adjusted 1998 sg a expense. as previously discussed, this increase is primarily attributable to higher levels of selling and administrative costs driven by increased net sales, headcount increases to support future growth and costs associated with certain redundant operations resulting from the company's 1998 acquisitions which operations the company is integrating and the decision to bring in house certain functions that had previously been outsourced. the company is in the process of fully integrating certain of these functions and expects that when this process has been completed consolidated sg a expense for these functions will be reduced. partially offsetting these increases in sg a expense are certain 1998 expenses which did not reoccur in 1999. these 1998 expenses include increases associated with restructuring reserve at coleman approximately 7 million and higher bad debt expense approximately 5 million . operating results for the first nine months of 1999 and 1998, were a profit of 3.0 million in 1999 and a loss of 391.7 million in 1998. adjusted for the historical results of the acquired companies and excluding non recurring charges, as previously described, operating results for the 1999 and 1998 periods were a profit of 21.7 million and a loss of 149.2 million, respectively. this change resulted from the factors discussed above. interest expense increased from 88.5 million in 1998 to 136.6 million in 1999. approximately 75 of the change related to higher borrowing levels in 1999 resulting primarily from borrowings for the acquisitions that were outstanding for the entire 1999 nine month period as compared to only a portion of the 1998 period. the balance of this increase was primarily driven by the amortization of the loan commitment fee approximately 2 million the company is obligated to pay under the terms of the new credit facility and the expense related to liquidated damages payable to debenture holders approximately 3 million . other income, net of 4.6 million in 1999 included a gain of approximately 4 million relating to the sale of the mexico city facility. this gain was partially offset by losses from other miscellaneous asset sales of approximately 0.3 million. the remaining other income, net in 1999 resulted from favorable foreign exchange rates, primarily from the company's operations in japan. other income, net of 4.1 million in 1998 included 8.0 million from the settlement of a lawsuit partially offset by net foreign exchange losses, primarily from mexico. the minority interest reported in 1999 and 1998 relates to the minority interest held in coleman by public shareholders. approximately 6 million of the 12.7 million income tax expense recorded in 1999 related to u.s. tax liability generated by coleman as a separate u.s. tax filing entity. as previously discussed, in july 1999, the company acquired a sufficient ownership interest in coleman to permit it to file consolidated u.s. tax returns with coleman for all future periods. the remaining tax expense recorded in 1999 related to taxes on foreign income and was partially offset by the favorable resolution of an income tax audit. tax expense recorded in 1998 was nearly all related to foreign taxes. no net tax benefit was recorded on the company's losses in either year as it is management's assessment that the company cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets resulting from these losses would be realized through future taxable income. in march 1998, the company prepaid a 75.0 million 7.85 industrial revenue bond related to its hattiesburg facility originally due in 2009. in connection with the early extinguishment of this debt, the company recognized an extraordinary charge in the first quarter of 1998. as a result of repayment of certain indebtedness assumed in the coleman acquisition, the company also recognized an extraordinary charge in the second quarter of 1998. the debt assumed in connection with the coleman acquisition was repaid as a result of the requirements under the terms of the new credit facility. these extraordinary charges consisted of redemption premiums 106.9 million , unamortized debt discount 13.8 million and unamortized deferred financing costs 1.7 million and were net of income taxes 10.7 million . 30 foreign operations approximately 75 of the company's business is conducted in u.s. dollars including both domestic sales, u.s. dollar denominated export sales, primarily to certain latin american markets, asian sales and the majority of european sales . the company's non u.s. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries in europe, canada, japan, latin america and mexico. mexico reverted to a hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997 therefore, translation adjustments related to mexican net monetary assets were included as a component of net loss earnings. mexico is not considered hyperinflationary as of january 1, 1999. this change in mexico's hyperinflationary status is not expected to have a material effect on the company's financial results. translation adjustments resulting from the company's non u.s. dollar denominated subsidiaries have not had a material impact on the company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. while revenues generated in asia have traditionally not been significant, economic instability in this region is expected to have a negative effect on earnings. economic instability and the political environment in latin america have also affected sales in that region. it is anticipated that sales in and exports to these regions will continue to be impacted so long as the economic environments in those regions remain unsettled. on a limited basis, the company selectively uses derivatives foreign exchange option and forward contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures that arise in the normal course of business. no derivative contracts are entered into for trading or speculative purposes. the use of derivatives has not had a material impact on the company's financial results. seasonality sunbeam's consolidated sales are not expected to exhibit substantial seasonality however, sales are expected to be strongest during the second quarter of the calendar year. furthermore, sales of a number of products, including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers, grills, first alert products, camping and generator products may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions. liquidity and capital resources debt instruments in order to finance the acquisition of coleman, first alert and signature brands and to refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of the company and the three acquired companies, the company consummated an offering in march 1998 of zero coupon debentures having a yield to maturity of 5 , which resulted in approximately 730 million of net proceeds and borrowed about 1,325 million under its new bank credit facility. the debentures are exchangeable for shares of the company 's common stock at an initial conversion rate of 6.575 shares for each 1,000 principal amount at maturity of the debentures, subject to adjustments upon occurrence of specified events. the debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the company. the debentures are not redeemable by the company prior to march 25, 2003. on or after such date, the debentures are redeemable for cash with at least 30 days notice, at the option of the company. the company is required to purchase debentures at the option of the holder as of march 25, 2003, march 25, 2008 and march 25, 2013, at purchase prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to such dates. sunbeam may, at its option, elect to pay any such purchase price in cash or common stock or any combination thereof. however, the bank credit facility prohibits the company from redeeming or repurchasing debentures for cash. the company was required to file a registration statement with the sec to register the debentures by june 23, 1998. this registration statement was filed on february 4, 1999 and, as amended, was declared effective on november 8, 1999. the company 's failure to file the registration statement by june 23, 1998 did not constitute default under the terms of the debentures. from june 23, 1998 until the registration statement was declared effective, the company was required to pay to the debenture holders cash liquidated damages accruing, for each day during such period, at a rate per annum equal to 0.25 during the first 90 days and 0.50 thereafter multiplied by the total of the issue price of the debentures plus the original issue discount thereon on such day. the company has made total payments for liquidated damages since june 23, 1998 of 4.5 million, of which 1.5 million related to damages for the period through december 31, 1998. a final payment of approximately 0.5 million, representing liquidated damages from september 26, 1999 until the registration statement was declared effective, will be payable on march 25, 2000. 31 concurrent with the acquisitions, the company replaced its 250 million syndicated unsecured five year revolving credit facility with the bank credit facility. the bank credit facility provided for aggregate borrowings of up to 1.7 billion and in addition to other customary covenants, required the company to maintain specified consolidated leverage, interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as of the end of each fiscal quarter occurring after march 31, 1998 and on or prior to the latest stated maturity date for any of the borrowings under the bank credit facility. as a result of, among other things, its operating losses incurred during the first half of 1998, the company did not achieve the specified financial ratios for june 30, 1998 and it appeared unlikely that the company would achieve the specified financial ratios for september 30, 1998. consequently, the company and its lenders entered into an agreement dated as of june 30, 1998 that waived through december 31, 1998 all defaults arising from the failure of the company to satisfy the specified financial ratios for june 30, 1998 and september 30, 1998. pursuant to an agreement with the company dated as of october 19, 1998, the company 's lenders extended all of the waivers under the june 30 agreement through april 10, 1999 and also waived through such date all defaults arising from any failure by the company to satisfy the specified financial ratios for december 31, 1998. as part of the october 19, 1998 agreement, the company agreed to a minimum monthly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ebitda covenant as defined in the bank credit facility which covenant the company has been able to satisfy. on april 10, 1999, among other things, the lenders extended all of the waivers set forth in the october 19, 1998 agreement through april 15, 1999. on april 15, 1999, the company and its lenders entered into a comprehensive amendment to the bank credit facility that, among other things, extended all of the waivers under the april 10, 1999 agreement until april 10, 2000 and waived until such date all defaults arising from any failure by the company to satisfy the specified financial ratios for any fiscal quarter end occurring during 1999 and for march 31, 2000. as part of the april 15, 1999 bank credit facility amendment, the company agreed to a minimum cumulative ebitda covenant that is based on post december 31, 1998 consolidated ebitda and is tested at the end of each month occurring on or prior to march 31, 2000, as well as a covenant limiting the amount of revolving loans other than those used to fund the coleman merger that may be outstanding under the bank credit facility as of the end of each such month. the minimum cumulative ebitda was initially 6.3 million for the period january 1, 1999 through april 30, 1999 and generally grows on a monthly basis until it reaches 121.0 million for the period from january 1, 1999 through march 31, 2000. following is a description of the significant terms of the bank credit facility as amended april 15, 1999. the bank credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to 1.7 billion through o a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 400.0 million maturing march 30, 2005, 52.5 million of which may only be used to complete the coleman merger o up to 800.0 million in term loans maturing on march 30, 2005, of which 35.0 million may only be used to complete the coleman merger and o a 500.0 million term loan maturing september 30, 2006, of which 5.0 million has already been repaid through september 30, 1999. as of september 30, 1999, approximately 1.5 billion was outstanding and approximately 0.2 billion was available for borrowing under the bank credit facility. under the bank credit facility, interest accrues, at the company 's option o at the london interbank offered rate libor o or at the base rate of the administrative agent which is generally the higher of the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent or the federal funds rate plus 0.50 in each case plus an interest margin which is currently 4.00 for libor borrowings and 2.50 for base rate borrowings. the applicable interest margin is subject to downward adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events including a 1.00 decrease for libor borrowings and a 0.75 decrease for base rate borrowings concurrent with the effective date of the coleman merger. 32 under the terms of the april 15, 1999 amendment to the bank credit facility, the company is obligated to pay the bank lenders a loan commitment fee of between 0.25 to 1.00 of the commitments under the bank credit facility as of april 15, 1999. the percentage used to calculate the fee will be determined by reference to the bank lenders' aggregate commitments and loan exposure under the bank credit facility as they may be reduced on or before september 30, 2000. the fee is payable on the earlier of september 30, 2000 and the date the commitments are terminated and the loans and other amount payable under the bank credit facility are repaid. see note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. borrowings under the bank credit facility are secured by a pledge of the stock of the company's material subsidiaries, including coleman, and by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the company and its material domestic subsidiaries, other than coleman and its material subsidiaries except as described below. currently, coleman's inventory and related assets are pledged to secure its obligations for letters of credit issued for its account under the bank credit facility. additionally, as security for coleman's note payable to the company, coleman pledged substantially all of its domestic assets, other than real property, including 66 of the stock of its direct foreign subsidiaries and domestic holding companies for its foreign subsidiaries and all of the stock of its other direct domestic subsidiaries but not the assets of coleman's subsidiaries. the pledge runs in favor of the company 's lending banks, to which the coleman note has been pledged as security for the company 's obligations to them. upon completion of the coleman merger, substantially all of coleman's assets and the assets of coleman's domestic subsidiaries will be pledged to secure the obligations under the bank credit facility. in addition, borrowings under the bank credit facility are guaranteed by a number of the company 's wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries and these subsidiary guarantees are secured as described above. upon completion of the coleman merger, coleman and each of its united states subsidiaries will become guarantors of the obligations under the bank credit facility. to the extent extensions of credit are made to any subsidiaries of the company, the obligations of such subsidiaries are guaranteed by the company. in addition to the above described financial ratios and tests, the bank credit facility contains covenants customary for credit facilities of a similar nature, including limitations on the ability of the company and its subsidiaries, including coleman, to, among other things o declare dividends or repurchase stock o prepay, redeem or repurchase debt, incur liens and engage in sale leaseback transactions o make loans and investments o incur additional debt including revolving loans under the bank credit facility o amend or otherwise alter material agreements or enter into restrictive agreements o make capital and year 2000 compliance expenditures o engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales o engage in transactions with specified affiliates o settle specified litigation o alter its cash management system and o alter the businesses they conduct. sunbeam is also required to comply with specified financial covenants and ratios. the bank credit facility provides for events of default customary for transactions of this type, including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach of covenant, cross defaults, bankruptcy, material adverse change arising from compliance with erisa, material adverse judgments, entering into guarantees and change of ownership and control. it is also an event of default under the bank credit facility, as amended november 16, 1999, if the company 's registration statement in connection with the coleman merger is not declared effective by the sec on or before january 10, 2000, or if the merger does not occur within 25 business days of the effectiveness of the registration statement or if the cash consideration including any payments on account of the exercise of any appraisal rights, but excluding related legal, accounting and other customary fees and expenses to consummate the coleman merger exceeds 87.5 million. although there can be no assurance, the company anticipates that it will satisfy these conditions. furthermore, the bank credit facility requires the company to prepay term loans under the bank credit facility on december 31, 1999 to the extent that cash on hand in the company 's concentration accounts plus the aggregate amount of unused revolving loan commitments 33 on this date exceeds 125 million, but the company is not required to prepay more than 69.3 million in the aggregate as a result of this provision. unless waived by the bank lenders, the failure of the company to satisfy any of the financial ratios and tests contained in the bank credit facility or the occurrence of any other event of default under the bank credit facility would entitle the bank lenders to a receive a 2.00 increase in the interest rate applicable to outstanding loans and increase the trade letter of credit fees to 1.00 and b accelerate the maturity of the outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility and exercise all or any of their other rights and remedies. any such acceleration or other exercise of rights and remedies would likely have a material adverse effect on the company. the bank credit facility also includes provisions for the deferral of the september 30, 1999 and the march 31, 2000 scheduled term loan payments of 69.3 million each until april 10, 2000 as a result of the satisfaction by the company of the agreed upon conditions to the deferral. see note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. cash flows as of september 30, 1999, the company had cash and cash equivalents of 29.1 million and total debt of 2.3 billion. because the waivers granted by the company's lenders expire on april 10, 2000, the borrowings under the bank credit facility, as well as other debt containing cross default provisions, are classified as current in the september 30, 1999 condensed consolidated balance sheet. cash used in operating activities during the first nine months of 1999 was 73.2 million compared to 224.7 million in the first nine months of 1998. this change is primarily attributable to improved operating results after giving effect to non cash items, partially offset by increased working capital needs during the 1999 period. the increase in cash used for working capital during the 1999 period was primarily driven by accounts receivable, which increased 159.4 million as compared to the 1998 period, primarily attributable to the company's outdoor leisure division which experienced stronger second and third quarters sales in 1999 than in 1998. additionally, working capital for the 1998 period was positively affected by the timing of the company's acquisition of coleman, which was at the peak of its inventory build for the 1998 selling season. cash used for this acquired inventory is not reflected in working capital for the 1998 period. as a result of the effect of company's management of inventory levels in 1999, cash flow improved approximately 81 million as compared to 1998 despite the favorable impact of the inventory acquired in connection with the 1998 acquisitions. increases in accounts payable of approximately 30 million in the first nine months of 1999 positively impacted cash flow whereas payables used approximately 76 million of cash in the same period of 1998, resulting in an improvement in cash flow period to period of approximately 106 million. the increase in payables in the current period resulted from payable balances having been reduced to a low level by year end 1998. this reduction in payables, which included an effort to reduce delinquent payables, began in the second quarter of 1998. decreases in other liabilities, primarily accrued interest, account for the majority of the balance of the cash used for working capital in 1999. the company participates in an accounts receivable securitization program to finance a portion of its accounts receivable. see note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. in the first nine months of 1999, cash used in investing activities was driven by capital expenditures of 63.2 million, primarily for information systems, including expenditures for year 2000 readiness and equipment and tooling for new products. capital spending in the comparable 1998 period was 32.8 million and was primarily for several manufacturing efficiency initiatives, equipment and tooling for new products and management information systems and software licenses. the new product capital spending in the 1998 period principally related to the appliance category and included costs related to water and air filtration products which were discontinued in the second quarter, blenders, standmixers and irons. cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 1998 also reflects 379.2 million for the acquisitions of the shares of coleman from a subsidiary of macandrews forbes, as well as the acquisitions of signature brands and first alert. the company anticipates 1999 capital spending to be less than 5 of net sales. capital expenditures in the current year are expected to primarily relate to information systems and related support, including expenditures for year 2000 readiness, new product introductions and capacity additions. cash provided by financing activities totaled 99.2 million in the first nine months of 1999 and reflected net borrowings under the company's bank credit facility. cash provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 1998 was 636.1 million and reflected net proceeds from the debentures of 729.6 million, the cancellation and repayment of all outstanding balances under the company's 250 million september 1996 revolving credit facility, the repayment of certain debt assumed in connection with the coleman, signature brands and first alert acquisitions, and the early extinguishment of the 75.0 million hattiesburg industrial revenue bond. in addition, cash provided by financing 34 activities in 1998 is net of 26.2 million of financing fees related to sunbeam's 1.7 billion bank credit facility and 19.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. see note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. at september 30, 1999, standby and commercial letters of credit aggregated 68.9 million and were predominately for insurance, pension, environmental, workers' compensation, and international trade activities. in addition, as of september 30, 1999, surety bonds with a contract value of 67.5 million were outstanding largely for the company's pension plans and as a result of litigation judgments that are currently under appeal. the company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in coleman in a merger transaction in which the existing coleman minority shareholders will receive 0.5677 of a share of the company's common stock and 6.44 in cash for each share of coleman common stock outstanding. in addition, unexercised options under coleman's stock option plans will be cashed out at a price per share equal to the difference between 27.50 and the exercise price of such options. the company expects to issue approximately 6.7 million shares of common stock and expend approximately 87 million in cash, including cash paid to option holders, to complete the coleman transaction. under a settlement of certain litigation relating to the coleman merger, the company will also issue warrants to purchase up to 4.98 million shares of the company's common stock to the coleman public shareholders and the plaintiff's litigation counsel upon consummation of the coleman merger. see notes 2 and 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. although there can be no assurance, it is anticipated that the coleman merger will occur in the fourth quarter of 1999 or early in the first quarter of 2000. the company believes its borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility, cash flow from the combined operations of the company and its acquired companies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivable securitization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs, capital expenditure and year 2000 compliance spending, and debt service through april 10, 2000. the company intends to negotiate with its lenders on an amendment to the bank credit facility, negotiate with its lenders on further waiver of such covenants and other terms or refinance the bank credit facility. any decisions with respect to such amendment, waiver, or refinancing will be made based on a review from time to time of the advisability of particular transactions. there can be no assurance that an amendment, further waiver of existing covenants and other terms, or refinancing will be entered into by april 10, 2000. the failure to obtain such an amendment, further waiver or debt refinancing would likely result in violation of existing covenants and non compliance with other terms, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity of all outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the company. accordingly, debt related to the bank credit facility and all debt containing cross default provisions is classified as current in the september 30, 1999 condensed consolidated balance sheet. in may, 1998, the nyse advised the company that it did not meet the continuing listing standards of the nyse because the company did not have tangible net assets of at least 12 million and average annual net income of at least 600,000 for 1995, 1996 and 1997. representatives from the company met with nyse officials, and in march 1999, the nyse informed the company that the company's common stock would not be delisted at that time, although the nyse would, however, continue to monitor sunbeam's financial condition and operations. on august 5, 1999, the nyse advised the company that the nyse had revised its continuing listing standards, and that the company is in compliance with the revised standards. in april, 1999 the nyse advised coleman that it did not meet the nyse's continuing listing standards because coleman did not have tangible net assets of at least 12 million and average annual net income of at least 600,000 for 1995, 1996 and 1997. at that time, coleman requested the nyse to continue to list the coleman common stock until completion of the merger. the nyse subsequently advised coleman that coleman also failed to satisfy certain non financial continuing listing standards. on august 5, 1999, the nyse advised the company that the nyse had revised its continuing listing standards, and that the company is in compliance with the revised financial standards. coleman and the nyse have agreed upon a program whereby coleman will correct the deficiencies in its non financial continuing listing standards by the end of 1999. coleman is currently complying with such program. if coleman were to be delisted from the nyse, it would adversely affect coleman's ability to sell its capital stock to third parties or use its capital stock as collateral for loans. sunbeam's bank credit facility currently restricts coleman from taking such actions. by letter dated june 17, 1998, the staff of the division of enforcement of the sec advised the company that it was conducting an informal inquiry into the company 's accounting policies and procedures and requested that the company produce documents. on july 2, 1998, the sec issued a formal order of private investigation, designating officers to take testimony and pursuant to which a subpoena was served on sunbeam requiring the production of 35 documents. on november 4, 1998, the company received another sec subpoena requiring the production of additional documents. the company has provided numerous documents to the sec staff and continues to cooperate with the sec staff. the company has, however, declined to provide the sec with material that the company believes is subject to the attorney client privilege and the work product immunity. the company cannot predict the duration of such investigation or its outcome. the company is involved in significant litigation, including class and derivative actions, relating to events which led to the restatement of its consolidated financial statements, the issuance of the macandrews forbes warrant, the sale of the debentures and the employment agreements of messrs. dunlap and kersh. sunbeam intends to vigorously defend each of the actions, but cannot predict the outcome and is not currently able to evaluate the likelihood of the company 's success in each case or the range of potential loss. however, if the company were to lose these suits, judgments would likely have a material adverse effect on the company 's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. additionally, the company's insurance carriers have filed various suits requesting a declaratory judgment that the directors' and officers' liability insurance policies for excess coverage was invalid and or had been properly canceled by the carriers or have advised sunbeam of their intent to deny coverage under such policies. the company intends to pursue recovery from all of its insurers if damages are awarded against the company or its indemnified officers and or directors under any of the foregoing actions and to recover attorneys' fees covered under those policies. the company 's failure to obtain such insurance recoveries following an adverse judgment against the company on any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on the company 's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs damages and or settlement amounts in connection with pending litigation and claims and related anticipated legal fees. the costs are accrued when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. the accruals are based upon the company 's assessment, after consultation with counsel, of probable loss based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature of the claim made, the nature of the damages sought and any relevant information about the plaintiff, and other significant factors which vary by case. when it is not possible to estimate a specific expected amount of loss to be incurred, the company evaluates the range of possible losses and records the minimum end of the range. as of september 30, 1999 the company had established accruals for litigation matters of 22.6 million representing 11.3 million and 11.3 million for estimated damages or settlement amounts and legal fees, respectively and 31.2 million as of december 31, 1998 representing 17.5 million and 13.7 million for estimated damages or settlements and legal fees, respectively. it is anticipated that the 22.6 million accrual will be paid as follows 5.2 million in 1999, 14.9 million in 2000 and 2.5 million in 2001. the company believes, based on information known to the company on september 30, 1999, that anticipated probable costs of litigation matters existing as of september 30, 1999 have been adequately reserved, to the extent determinable. as a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the company faces the constant risks of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for substantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. these claims could result in liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. some of the product lines the company acquired in the 1998 acquisitions have increased its exposure to product liability and related claims. the company and its subsidiaries are also involved in various lawsuits from time to time that sunbeam considers to be ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business. in the opinion of the company, the resolution of these routine matters, and of matters relating to prior operations, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the company. see note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. new accounting standards effective january 1, 1999, the company adopted statement of position 98 1, accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 98 1 . sop 98 1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 36 in june 1998, the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no. 133 sfas no. 133 , accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which, as amended, is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15, 2000. sfas no. 133 requires the recognition of all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. the company has not yet determined the impact sfas no. 133 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. year 2000 readiness disclosure the company is preparing for the impact of the year 2000 on its operations. year 2000 issues could include potential problems in the information technology it and non it systems that the company uses in its operations and problems in the company's products. year 2000 system failures could affect routine but critical operations such as forecasting, purchasing, production, order processing, inventory control, shipping, billing and collection. in addition, system failures could affect the company's security, payroll operations, or employee safety. the company may also be exposed to potential risks from third parties with whom the company interacts who fail to adequately address their own year 2000 issues. sunbeam's approach to year 2000 issues while the company's year 2000 readiness planning had been underway for over one year, during the third quarter of 1998 the company established a cross functional project team consisting of senior managers, assisted by three external consulting firms which were retained to provide consulting services and to assist the company in implementing its year 2000 strategy. this team is sponsored by the company's chief financial officer who reports directly to the company's chief executive officer on this issue. the audit committee of the board of directors is advised periodically on the status of the company's year 2000 readiness program. the year 2000 project team has developed a phased approach to identify and resolve year 2000 issues with many of these activities conducted in parallel. the company's approach and the anticipated timing of each phase are described below. phase 1 inventory and assessment during the first phase of sunbeam's year 2000 readiness program, the company established a year 2000 program management office pmo to centralize the management of all of the company's year 2000 projects. through this office, the company developed a corporate wide, uniform strategy for assessing and addressing the year 2000 issues. the company has completed an inventory of its hardware and software systems, manufacturing equipment, electronic data interchange, telecommunications and other technical assets potentially subject to year 2000 problems, such as security systems and controls for lighting, air conditioning, ventilation and facility access. this inventory was then entered into the company's year 2000 database along with a determination of the item's level of criticality to operations. for those inventory items anticipated to have a significant effect on the business if not corrected, the company's year 2000 program envisions repair or replacement and testing of such items. all information relative to each item is being tracked in the company's year 2000 database. the company completed most of this phase during the third and fourth quarters of 1998. the company has completed a review of the readiness of embedded microprocessors in its products and determined that none of the company's products have year 2000 date sensitive systems. phase 2 correction and testing the second phase of sunbeam's year 2000 readiness program was structured to replace, upgrade or remediate as necessary those items identified during phase 1 as requiring corrective action. sunbeam relies on its it functions to perform many tasks that are critical to its operations. significant transactions that could be impacted by not being ready for any year 2000 issues include, among others, purchases of materials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, payroll processing and billings and collections. systems and applications that had been identified by sunbeam as not year 2000 ready and which are critical to sunbeam's operations include its financial software systems, which process the order entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accounts receivable, and accounts payable functions, payroll applications, and critical applications in the company's manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as warehouse management applications. recognizing how dependent the entire company is on it, sunbeam decided in 1997 to replace its primary business applications with a uniform international business and accounting information system to address the systems or applications listed above as well as to improve internal reporting processes. based upon representations from the manufacturer that the current 37 version of this uniform information system is year 2000 ready, the company upgraded its business sites that currently utilize this uniform system to the year 2000 ready version. in addition to the pre acquisition sunbeam locations which had already utilized an earlier non year 2000 ready version of this uniform business and accounting information system, eastpak, mr. coffee, health o meter and sunbeam latin america replaced their non year 2000 ready systems with this new uniform system. in addition, coleman europe has also replaced key business components with this new system. the company is also actively replacing and or upgrading a number of business systems that are not year 2000 ready, including those that use localized business system packages which were not candidates to be replaced by the uniform business and accounting information system. for example, at coleman approximately 2,000 mainframe software programs that are used in lieu of sunbeam's uniform business and accounting information system have been remediated and tested to be year 2000 ready. with respect to the company's non it systems for example, time and attendance, security, and in line manufacturing hardware the company has analyzed these items to assess any year 2000 issues and is testing and correcting such times, if necessary. phase 3 customers, suppliers and business partners the third phase of sunbeam's year 2000 readiness program which was initiated during the third and fourth quarters of 1998 is designed to assess and interact with the company's customers, suppliers, and business partners. as part of this effort, the company surveyed 1,100 vendors and suppliers, a portion of which did not provide an initial response. during the first half of 1999, high risk vendors were contacted directly and the number of non respondents has since decreased substantially. in fact, currently only 7 of the company's vendors who were surveyed are categorized as high risk which includes non respondents. based on the most recent responses to the survey and continued evaluation, the company believes that there is only a low to a medium risk of year 2000 issues for the remaining vendors. the company will continue to monitor the year 2000 progress of the high risk vendors and has re surveyed these companies to determine the appropriate course of action. furthermore, the company has contacted alternate vendors who are year 2000 ready to replace critical vendors deemed high risk in the event that these vendors are not found to be year 2000 ready. the company is in the process of completing a verification of the year 2000 survey responses for the most critical vendors to the company. sunbeam has responded to numerous customer inquiries about the company's year 2000 readiness. the company has verified that all of the company's major customers have planned programs to deal with year 2000 issues and is currently completing the process of contacting its major customers to confirm they are implementing their planned programs to address year 2000 issues. in order to improve the company's communication with its customers, suppliers and business partners, the company has set up a sunbeam year 2000 telephone number and is providing year 2000 information on a company web site. phase 4 contingency planning this phase involves contingency planning for unresolved year 2000 issues, particularly any issues arising with third party suppliers. the company has designed and documented its year 2000 contingency plan and is in the process of implementing it. the development of the contingency plan included a process whereby the company's critical it and non it systems were evaluated for year 2000 readiness. as a result of this evaluation, the company does not expect to require additional operational equipment or significant process contingency measures. although the company does not currently believe there is significant risk associated with its third party suppliers, the contingency plan includes the continuing evaluation of the readiness of the company's suppliers and minor increases in the company's inventory requirements to protect against supply disruption. the risks of sunbeam's year 2000 approach the independent consultants assisting the company in its year 2000 readiness program have reviewed and concurred with the company's approach, have assisted in developing cost estimates and have monitored costs for the largest single component upgrade or installation of the company's uniform system of the company's year 2000 program. since sunbeam's year 2000 program was developed and is monitored with the help of independent consultants, the company did not engage another independent third party to verify the program's overall approach or total cost as the company believes that the company's exposure in this regard is mitigated. in addition, through the use of external third party diagnostic software packages that are designed to analyze the year 2000 readiness of business software programs, the company was able to identify potential year 2000 issues at coleman. given this, the company believes that it has also mitigated its risk by validating and verifying key program components. management believes that, although there are significant systems that are being modified or replaced, including the uniform business and accounting information system, sunbeam's information systems environment will be made year 38 2000 ready prior to january 1, 2000. sunbeam's failure to timely complete such corrective work could have a material adverse impact on the company. with respect to customers, suppliers and business partners, the failure of certain of these third parties to become year 2000 ready could also have a material adverse impact on sunbeam. for example, the failure of certain of the company's principal suppliers to have year 2000 ready internal systems could impact the company's ability to manufacture and or ship its products or to maintain adequate inventory levels for production. at this time, the company believes that the most likely worst case scenario relating to year 2000 involves potential disruptions in areas in which the company's operations must rely on third parties, such as suppliers, whose systems may not work properly after january 1, 2000. while such system failures could either directly or indirectly affect important operations of the company and its subsidiaries in a significant manner, the company cannot at present estimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures. subject to the nature of the goods or services provided to the company by third parties whose operations are not made ready for year 2000 issues, the potential impact on sunbeam's operations could be material. however, the company believes that it has mitigated such risks through the development and implementation of the contingency plans discussed above. the nature and focus of the company's efforts to address the year 2000 problem may be revised periodically as interim goals are achieved or new issues are identified. in addition, it is important to note that the description of the company's efforts and assessments necessarily involves estimates and projections with respect to activities required in the future. these estimates and projections are subject to change as work continues, and such changes may be substantial. the costs to address the company's year 2000 issues through the first nine months of 1999, including costs incurred in 1998, sunbeam had expended approximately 60 million to address year 2000 issues of which approximately 50 was recorded as capital expenditures and the remainder as sg a expense. sunbeam's current assessment of the total costs to address and remedy year 2000 issues and enhance its operating systems, including costs for the acquired companies, is approximately 64 million. this estimate includes the following categories o uniform international business and accounting systems 44 million o localized business system software upgrades and remediation 9 million o year 2000 readiness assessment and tracking 6 million o upgrade of personal computers and related software 5 million the amount to be incurred for year 2000 issues during 1999 of approximately 44 million represents over 50 of the company's total 1999 budget for information systems and related support, including year 2000 costs. a large majority of these costs are expected to be incremental expenditures that will not recur in the year 2000 or thereafter. fees and expenses related to third party consultants, who are involved in the pmo as well as the modification and replacement of software, represent approximately 75 of the total estimated cost. the balance of the total estimated cost relates primarily to software license fees and new hardware, but excludes the costs associated with company employees. sunbeam expects these expenditures to be financed through operating cash flows or borrowings, as applicable. a significant portion of these expenditures will enhance sunbeam's operating systems in addition to resolving the year 2000 issues. as sunbeam completes its assessment of the year 2000 issues, the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differ materially from the amounts shown above. the bank credit facility does not permit the company to spend more than 50 million on year 2000 testing and remediation in 1999. because year 2000 readiness is critical to the business, sunbeam has redeployed some resources from non critical system enhancements to address year 2000 issues, thereby deferring the non critical systems enhancements. the company does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to have a material impact on the company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 39 cautionary statements certain statements in this quarterly report on form 10 q
