energy inc. notes to unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements note 1 nature of business and summary of significant accounting policies nature of operations we are a multi faceted oilfield service company that provides services and equipment to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, domestically in texas, louisiana, new mexico, colorado, oklahoma, mississippi, utah, wyoming, offshore in the gulf of mexico, and internationally in argentina, mexico and bolivia. we operate in six sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry directional drilling services rental tools international drilling casing and tubing services compressed air drilling services and production services. we derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and equipment required to provide a service and rates per day for equipment and tools that we rent to our customers. the price we charge for our services depends upon several factors, including the level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular geographic regions in which we operate. contracts are awarded based on price, quality of service and equipment and general reputation and experience of our personnel. the principal operating costs are direct and indirect labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment, insurance, equipment rentals, fuel, depreciation and general and administrative expenses. basis of presentation our unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission, or sec. accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. we believe that the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate to make the information not misleading. the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods. these unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2005. the results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year. certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year s consolidated condensed financial statements to conform with the current period presentation. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty. accordingly, our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. while management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. estimates are used for, but are not limited to, determining the following allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of long lived assets and intangibles, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes and valuation allowances. the accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. in july 2006, the fasb issued fasb interpretation no. 48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109 fin 48 . fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no. 109, accounting for income taxes. it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2006. we are currently evaluating the provisions of fin 48 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements. in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 157, fair value measurements sfas 157 , which is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements by defining fair value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value measurements. sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas 157 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements. 6 table of contents allis chalmers energy inc. notes to unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements note 2 acquisitions effective

stock based compensation we adopted sfas no. 123r, share based payment, effective january 1, 2006. this statement requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. compensation cost for awards granted prior to, but not vested, as of january 1, 2006 would be based on the grant date attributes originally used to value those awards for pro forma purposes under sfas no. 123. we adopted sfas no. 123r using the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the black scholes option pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. under the modified prospective method, we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of december 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining vesting periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. we estimated forfeiture rates for the first nine months of 2006 based on our historical experience. the black scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock based awards. the risk free rate of interest is the related u.s. treasury yield curve for periods within the expected term of the option at the time of grant. the dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero as we have historically not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future. the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock. prior to january 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock based compensation using accounting principle board opinion no. 25. under apb no. 25, compensation expense is recognized for stock options with an exercise price that is less than the market price on the grant date of the option. for stock options with exercise prices at or above the market value of the stock on the grant date, we adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no. 123, accounting for stock based compensation. we also adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no. 123 for the stock options granted to our employees and directors. accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized under apb no. 25. our net income for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2006 includes approximately 860,000 and 2,638,000 of compensation costs related to share based payments. as of september 30, 2006 there is 1.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested stock option grants. we expect approximately 660,000 to be recognized over the remainder of 2006, approximately 900,000 to be recognized in 2007 and approximately 14,000 to be recognized in 2008. 9 table of contents allis chalmers energy inc. notes to unaudited consolidated

sfas no. 128, earnings per share. sfas no. 128 requires companies with complex capital structures to present basic and diluted earnings per share. basic earnings per share are computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares e.g., convertible preferred stock, stock options, etc. as if they had been converted. potential dilutive common shares that have an anti dilutive effect e.g., those that increase income per share are excluded from diluted earnings per share. the components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows in thousands, except per share amounts for the three

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this document contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements. factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the general condition of the oil and natural gas drilling industry, demand for our oil and natural gas service and rental products, and competition. other factors are identified in our sec filings, including our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2005 under the heading risk factors located at the end of item 7, management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected historical financial data and our accompanying financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this document. the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed above. overview of our business we are a multi faceted oilfield services company that provides services and equipment to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, domestically in texas, louisiana, new mexico, colorado, oklahoma, mississippi, utah, wyoming, offshore in the gulf of mexico and internationally in argentina, mexico and bolivia. we currently operate in six sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry directional drilling services rental tools international drilling casing and tubing services compressed air drilling services and production services. we derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and equipment required to provide a service and rates per day for equipment and tools that we rent to our customers. the price we charge for our services depends upon several factors, including the level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular geographic regions in which we operate. contracts are awarded based on price, quality of service and equipment, and general reputation and experience of our personnel. the demand for drilling services has historically been volatile and is affected by the capital expenditures of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which can fluctuate based upon the prices of oil and natural gas, or the expectation for the prices of oil and natural gas. the number of working drilling rigs, typically referred to as the rig count, is an important indicator of activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry. the rig count in the u.s. increased from 862 as of december 31, 2002 to 1,744 on september 30, 2006 according to the baker hughes rig count. furthermore, directional and horizontal rig counts increased from 283 as of december 31, 2002 to 724 on september 30, 2006, which accounted for 32.8 and 42.0 of the total u.s. rig count, respectively. currently, we believe that the number of available drillings rigs is insufficient to meet the demand for drilling rigs. consequently, unless a significant number of additional drilling rigs are brought online, the rig count may not increase substantially despite the strong demand. our cost of revenues represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our equipment. the principal elements of these costs are direct and indirect labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment, insurance, equipment rentals, fuel and depreciation. operating expenses do not fluctuate in direct proportion to changes in revenues because, among other factors, we have a fixed base of inventory of equipment and facilities to support our operations, and in periods of low drilling activity we may also seek to preserve labor continuity to market our services and maintain our equipment. 24 table of contents comparison of three months ended september 30, 2006 and 2005 our revenues for the three months ended september 30, 2006 were 85.7 million, an increase of 196.6 compared to 28.9 million for the three months ended september 30, 2005. revenues increased in all of our business segments due to acquisitions completed in the third quarter of 2005 and in 2006, the investment in additional equipment, improved pricing for our services, the addition of operations and sales personnel and the opening of new operations offices. revenues increased most significantly due to the acquisition of dls drilling, logistics services corporation, or dls, on august 14, 2006 which expanded our operations to a sixth operating segment, international drilling. revenues also increased significantly at our rental tools segment due to the acquisition of specialty rental tools, inc., or specialty, effective january 1, 2006. our casing and tubing services segment also had a substantial increase in revenue, primarily due to the acquisitions of the casing and tubing assets of patterson services, inc on september 1, 2005, and the acquisition of rogers oil tool services, inc., or rogers, as of april 1, 2006, along with improved market conditions and increased market penetration for our services in south texas, east texas, louisiana and the u.s. gulf of mexico. revenues increased at our compressed air drilling segment due to the purchase of additional equipment and improved pricing for our services. our directional drilling services segment revenues increased in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period due to improved pricing for directional drilling services, the august 2005 acquisition of target energy, inc., or target, which provides measurement while drilling tools, or mwd and the purchase of additional down hole motors and mwds which increased our capacity and market presence. our gross profit for the quarter ended september 30, 2006 increased 249.6 to 28.8 million, or 33.6 of revenues, compared to 8.2 million, or 28.5 , of revenues for the three months ended september 30, 2005. the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in revenues in all of our business segments. the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the acquisition of specialty as of january 1, 2006, in the high margin rental tool business and the improved pricing for our services generally. the high margin rental tool business was offset in part by the lower margins that dls achieves in the international drilling segment. also contributing to our improved gross profit margin was the acquisition of target, the purchase of additional mwd s and the acquisition of rogers. the increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of 291.7 to 5.5 million for the third quarter of 2006 compared to 1.4 million for the third quarter of 2005. the increase is due to additional depreciable assets resulting from the acquisitions and capital expenditures. our cost of revenues consists principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of our equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. because many of our costs are fixed, our gross profit as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues. general and administrative expense was 9.1 million in the third quarter of 2006 period compared to 4.3 million for the third quarter of 2005. general and administrative expense increased due to the additional expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the hiring of additional sales and administrative personnel. general and administrative expense also increased because of increased accounting and consulting fees and other expenses in connection with initiatives to strengthen our internal control processes, costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and increased corporate accounting and administrative staff. as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 10.6 in the 2006 quarter and 14.7 in the 2005 quarter. we adopted sfas no. 123r, share based payment, effective january 1, 2006. this statement requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. we adopted sfas no. 123r using the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the black scholes option pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. under the modified prospective method, we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of december 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining vesting periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. therefore, we recorded an expense of 0.9 million related to stock options for the three months ended september 30, 2006, of which 727,000 was recorded in general and administrative expense with the balance being recorded as a direct cost. prior to january 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock based compensation using accounting principle board opinion no. 25. under apb no. 25, compensation expense is recognized for stock options with an exercise price that is less than the market price on the grant date of the option. accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized under apb no. 25. amortization expense was 681,000 in the third quarter of 2006 compared to 452,000 in the third quarter of 2005. the increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions and the amortization of deferred financing costs. 25 table of contents income from operations for the three months ended september 30, 2006 totaled 19.1 million, a 440.7 increase over income from operations of 3.5 million for the three months ended september 30, 2005, reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross profit, offset in part by increased general and administrative expenses and amortization. our net interest expense was 4.7 million in the third quarter of 2006, compared to 2.1 million for the third quarter of 2005. interest expense increased in the 2006 quarter due to the increased debt at a higher average interest rate. in january of 2006 we issued 160.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at 9.0 to fund the acquisition of specialty, pay off other outstanding debt and for working capital. in august of 2006 we issued an additional 95.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at 9.0 to fund a portion of the acquisition of dls. in the third quarter of 2005, we incurred debt retirement expense of 1.1 million related to the refinancing of our debt. this amount includes prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred financing fees from a previous financing. our provision for income taxes for the quarter ended september 30, 2006 was 3.1 million, or 21.7 of our net income before income taxes, compared to 230,000, or 15.1 of our net income before income taxes for the three months ended september 30, 2005. the increase in income taxes is attributable to our higher operating income and the increase in percentage of income taxes to net income before income taxes is primarily attributable to our operations in argentina which are taxed at 35.0 . we had net income of 11.3 million for the third quarter of 2006, an increase of 770.2 , compared to net income of 1.3 million for the third quarter of 2005. the following table compares revenues and income from operations for each of our business segments. income loss from operations

million for the third quarter of 2006 from 1.7 million for the comparable 2005 period. the improved results for this segment are due to the increase in drilling activity in the texas and gulf coast areas, improved pricing for directional and horizontal drilling services, the acquisition of target as of august 1, 2005, the purchase of an additional six mwds. our increased operating expenses as a result of the addition of operations and personnel were more than offset by the growth in revenues and improved pricing for our services. rental tools segment revenues for the quarter ended september 30, 2006 for the rental tools segment were 13.2 million, an increase from 1.6 million in revenues for the quarter ended september 30, 2005. income from operations increased to 6.6 million in the 2006 period compared to 454,000 in the 2005 period. our rental tools revenues and operating income for the third quarter of 2006 increased compared to the prior year due primarily due to the acquisition of specialty. specialty was acquired as of january 1, 2006, the effective date of the acquisition. safco oil field products, inc., or safco, delta rental service, inc., or delta, and specialty were merged in february 2006 to form allis chalmers rental tools, inc 26 table of contents international drilling segment on august 14, 2006, we acquired dls which established the international drilling

segment revenues for the quarter ended september 30, 2006 for the casing and tubing services segment were 13.8 million, an increase of 169.7 from the 5.1 million in revenues for the quarter ended september 30, 2005. revenues from domestic operations increased to 12.3 million in the 2006 period from 3.8 million in the 2005 period as a result of the acquisition of rogers and the casing and tubing assets of patterson services on september 1, 2005, which resulted in increased market penetration for our services in south texas, east texas, louisiana and the u.s. gulf of mexico, and the impact of hurricanes in september 2005. revenues from mexico operations were 1.5 million for the third quarter of 2006 and 1.3 million in the third quarter of 2005. income from operations increased 179.5 to 3.7 million in the third quarter of 2006 from 1.3 million in the third quarter of 2005. the increase in this segment s operating income is due to our increased revenues from domestic

in revenues for the three months ended september 30, 2005. income from operations increased to 3.2 million in the 2006 period compared to income from operations of 1.8 million in the 2005 period. our compressed air drilling revenues and operating income for the third quarter of 2006 increased compared to the prior year due primarily due to the improved pricing for our services and our investment in additional equipment. production services segment revenues were 4.0 million for the three months ended september 30, 2006, an increase of 22.7 compared to 3.2 million in revenues for the three months ended september 30, 2005. income from operations increased to 119,000 in the 2006 period compared to a loss of 128,000 in the 2005 period. our production services revenues and operating income

increased 2.2 million to 3.8 million for the three months ended september 30, 2006 compared to 1.6 million for the three months ended september 30, 2005. the increase was due to stock option expense of 0.7 million recorded in 2006 with the adoption of sfas 123r, the increase in accounting and administrative staff to support the growing organization, increased franchise taxes based on our increased authorized shares and cost related to our sarbanes oxley compliance effort. comparison of nine months ended september 30, 2006 and 2005 our revenues for the nine months ended september 30, 2006 were 193.2 million, an increase of 169.0 compared to 71.8 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2005. revenues increased in all of our business segments due to acquisitions completed in the second and third quarters of 2005 and in 2006, the investment in additional equipment, improved pricing for our services, the addition of operations and sales personnel and the opening of new operations offices. revenues increased most significantly at our rental tools segment due to the acquisition of specialty, effective january 1, 2006 and delta, on april 1, 2005. our casing and tubing

april 1, 2006, along with improved market conditions and increased market penetration for our services in south texas, east texas, louisiana and the u.s. gulf of mexico. the acquisition of dls on august 14, 2006, generated 23.9 million for our international drilling segment. our directional drilling services segment revenues increased in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period due to improved pricing for directional drilling services, the acquisition of target, which provides mwd tools, the addition of operations and sales personnel, the opening of new operations offices and the purchase of additional down hole motors and mwds which increased our capacity and market presence. revenues also increased at our compressed air drilling segment due to the acquisition of the air drilling assets of w.t. enterprises, inc., or wt, on july 11, 2005, the purchase of additional equipment and improved pricing for our services in west texas. also contributing to increased revenues was the acquisition of capcoil tubing services, inc., or capcoil, as of may 1, 2005 in our production services segment. 27 table of contents our gross profit for the nine months ended september 30, 2006 increased 238.8 to 70.1 million, or 36.3 of revenues, compared to 20.7 million, or 28.8 , of revenues for the nine months ended september 30, 2005. the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in revenues in all of our business segments. the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the acquisition of specialty as of january 1, 2006 and the acquisition of delta as of april 1, 2005, in the high margin rental tool business and the improved pricing for our services generally. also contributing to our improved gross profit margin was the acquisition of target, the purchase of additional mwds and the acquisition of rogers. the increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of 271.1 to 12.6 million for the first nine months of 2006 compared to 3.4 million for the first nine months of 2005. the increase is due to additional depreciable assets resulting from the acquisitions and capital expenditures. our cost of revenues consists principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of our equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. because many of our costs are fixed, our gross profit as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues. general and administrative expense was 24.5 million in the first nine months of 2006 period compared to 10.7 million for the first nine months of 2005. general and administrative expense increased due to the additional expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the hiring of additional sales and administrative personnel. general and administrative expense also increased because of increased accounting and consulting fees and other expenses in connection with initiatives to strengthen our internal control processes, costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and increased corporate accounting and administrative staff. as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 12.7 for the nine months ended september 30, 2006 and 14.9 in the same period of 2005. we adopted sfas no. 123r, share based payment, effective january 1, 2006. this statement requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. with the adoption of sfas no. 123r, we recorded 2.6 million of expense related to stock options during the nine months ended september 30, 2006, of which 2.3 million was recorded as a general and administrative expense with the balance recorded as direct costs. we adopted sfas no. 123r using the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the black scholes option pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. under the modified prospective method, we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of december 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining vesting periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. prior to january 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock based compensation using accounting principle board opinion no. 25. under apb no. 25, compensation expense is recognized for stock options with an exercise price that is less than the market price on the grant date of the option. accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized under apb no. 25. amortization expense was 2.0 million in the first nine months of 2006 compared to 1.3 million in the first nine months of 2005. the increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions and the amortization of deferred financing costs. income from operations for the nine months ended september 30, 2006 totaled 43.6 million, a 401.5 increase over income from operations of 8.7 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2005, reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross profit, offset in part by increased general and administrative expenses, and amortization. our net interest expense was 12.1 million in the first nine months of 2006, compared to 3.2 million for the first nine months of 2005. interest expense increased in the 2006 period due to the increased debt at a higher average interest rate. in january of 2006 we issued 160.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at 9.0 to fund the acquisition of specialty, pay off other outstanding debt and for working capital. in august of 2006 we issued an additional 95.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at 9.0 to fund a portion of the dls acquisition. in the third quarter of 2005, we incurred debt retirement expense of 1.1 million related to the refinancing of our debt. this amount includes prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred financing fees from a previous financing. minority interest in income of subsidiaries

decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues is due to the increase in domestic revenues as compared to mexico revenues, which have higher operating income margins. compressed air drilling services segment our compressed air drilling revenues were 32.0 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2006, an increase of 92.1 compared to 16.7 million in revenues for the nine months ended

strategy of increasing the scope of services through both internal growth and acquisitions. we are regularly involved in discussions with a number of potential acquisition candidates. the acquisition of assets could require additional financing. we also expect to make capital expenditures to acquire and to maintain our existing equipment. our performance and cash flow from operations will be determined by the demand for our services which in turn are affected by our customers expenditures for oil and gas exploration and development, and industry perceptions and expectations of future oil and natural gas prices in the areas where we operate. we will need to refinance our existing debt facilities as they become due and provide funds for capital expenditures and acquisitions. to effect our expansion plans, we will require additional equity or debt financing. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the additional debt or equity capital or that we can do so on terms that will be acceptable to us. 33 table of contents recent developments on october 17, 2006, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of petro rentals, incorporated, or

critical accounting policies please see our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2005 for a description of other policies that are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. no material changes to such information have occurred during the nine months ended september 30, 2006. in july 2006, the fasb issued fasb interpretation no. 48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109 fin 48 . fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no. 109, accounting for income taxes. it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2006. we are currently evaluating the provisions of fin 48 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements. in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 157, fair value measurements sfas 157 , which is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements by defining fair value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value measurements. sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas 157 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements. item 3. quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk. we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange risks. interest rate risk. fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable rate debt obligations expose us to market risk. we are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in interest rates affecting our adjustable rate debt, and any future refinancing of our fixed rate debt and our future debt. 34 table of contents at december 31, 2005, we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations on approximately 49.0 million of notes payable and bank credit facility borrowings carrying variable interest rates. during the first quarter of 2006, we repaid the existing variable interest rate debt. as part of our acquisition of dls, we assumed various bank loans carrying variable interest rates with an outstanding balance of 7,946,000 as of september 30, 2006. we have also been subject to interest rate market risk for short term invested cash and cash equivalents. the principal of such invested funds would not be subject to fluctuating value because of their highly liquid short term nature. as of september 30, 2006, we had 43.1 million invested in short term investments. foreign currency exchange rate risk. we have designated the u.s. dollar as the functional currency for our operations in international locations as we contract with customers, purchase equipment and finance capital using the u.s. dollar. local currency transaction gains and losses, arising from remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in local currency, are included in our consolidated statements of income. we conduct business in mexico through our mexican partner, matyep. this business exposes us to foreign exchange risk. to control this risk, we provide for payment in u.s. dollars. however, we have historically provided our partner a discount upon payment equal to 50 of any loss suffered by our partner as a result of devaluation of the mexican peso between the date of invoicing and the date of payment. to date, such payments have not been material in amount. item 4. controls and procedures. a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules 13a 15 e and 15d 15 e as of the end of the period covered by this report, which we refer to as the evaluation date. as disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement, in each case, as set forth in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2005, as amended, we understated diluted earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted shares outstanding for the third quarter of 2003, for each of the first three quarters of 2004, for the years ended december 31, 2003 and 2004 and for the quarter ended march 31, 2005. in addition, we understated basic earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended september 30, 2004. consequently, we have restated our financial statements for each of those periods. the incorrect calculation resulted from a mathematical error and an improper application of statement of financial accounting standards, or sfas, no. 128, earnings per share. management has concluded that the need to restate our financial statements resulted, in part, from the lack of sufficient experienced accounting personnel, which in turn resulted in a lack of effective control over the financial reporting process. as part of our growth strategy over the past five years, we have completed acquisitions of several privately held businesses, including closely held entities. prior to becoming part of our consolidated company, these businesses were not required to implement or maintain, and did not implement or maintain, the disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting that federal law requires of publicly held companies such as ours. we are in the process of creating and implementing appropriate disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting at each of our recently acquired businesses. however, we have not yet completed this process and cannot assure you as to when the process will be complete. in addition, during the fourth quarter of 2005, we failed to timely file a current report on form 8 k relating to the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with recent stock option and warrant exercises. the current report, which was due to be filed in november 2005, was filed in february 2006. 35 table of contents as a result of the issues described above, our management has concluded that, as of the evaluation date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to enable us to record, process, summarize, and report information required to be included in our sec filings within the required time period, and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial accounting officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. b change in internal control over financial reporting. the following changes were made in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a 15 f and 15d 15 f under the exchange act during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting we continued the engagement of an independent internal controls consulting firm which is in the process of documenting, analyzing, identifying and testing internal controls. during the quarter we completed the process of consolidating our payroll functions, excluding recent acquisitions, to improve quality control over the process. in addition, we completed the change to a new third party processor to handle our payroll calculations. we hired an information technology director who has improved our back up capability and is in the process of upgrading our network infrastructure. we hired a tax manager with responsibility for tax notices and the preparation of income and franchise tax returns. we continue to implement improvements in the way the accounting software is utilized. part ii. other information item 1. legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. the legal proceedings are at different stages however, we believe that the likelihood of material loss relating to any such legal proceeding is remote.
