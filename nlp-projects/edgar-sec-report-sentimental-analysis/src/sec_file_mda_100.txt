percent, 6.7 percent and 5.3 percent in pacific, europe and latin american yields, respectively. the increase in revenues was due primarily to a strong u.s. economy, which led to strong demand for air travel and a favorable pricing climate. in addition, the first quarter of 1999 includes a schedule disruption which impacted the company's operations. american's traffic or revenue passenger miles rpms increased 6.8 percent to 27.0 billion miles for the quarter ended march 31, 2000, due primarily to the labor disagreement in the first quarter of 1999. american's capacity or available seat miles

increased 58.5 percent, or 204 million, due to a 47.4 percent increase in american's average price per gallon and a 6.3 percent increase in american's fuel consumption. the increase in fuel expense is

percent, due to the addition of new aircraft. commissions to agents decreased 10.8 percent, or 31 million, despite an increase of approximately 14 percent in passenger revenues, due primarily to the

million, due primarily to an increase in passengers boarded and rate increases. 7 10 other income expense increased 49 million due primarily to a 26 million increase in interest expense resulting from

net cash provided by operating activities in the three month period ended march 31, 2000 was 521 million, an increase of 369 million over the same period in 1999. this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the air traffic liability due to higher advanced sales and an increase in income from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable as compared to the same period in 1999. capital expenditures for the first three months of 2000 were 781 million, and included the acquisition of four boeing 777 200igws, four boeing 737 800s, five embraer 145s and three embraer 135 aircraft. these capital expenditures were financed with internally generated cash and the 559 million of cash received from the sabre dividend, except for the embraer aircraft acquisitions, which were funded through secured debt agreements. as of march 31, 2000, the company had commitments to acquire the following aircraft 77 boeing 737 800s, 22 boeing 777 200igws, 83 embraer emb 135s and 25 bombardier crj 700s. in addition, in may 2000, the company announced its agreement to purchase 20 boeing 757 200 aircraft and retire five mcdonnell douglas md 90 aircraft. deliveries of all aircraft continue through 2006. payments for all aircraft will approximate 1.8 billion during the remainder of 2000, 2.3 billion in 2001, 650 million in 2002 and an aggregate of approximately 1.0 billion in 2003 through 2006. the company expects to fund its remaining 2000 capital expenditures from the company's existing cash and short term investments, internally generated cash, and new financing depending upon capital market conditions and the company's evolving view of its long term needs. dallas love field in 1968, as part of an agreement between the cities of fort worth and dallas to build and operate dallas fort worth airport dfw , a bond ordinance was enacted by both cities the bond ordinance . the bond ordinance required both cities to direct all scheduled interstate passenger operations to dfw and was an integral part of the bonds issued for the construction and operation of dfw. in 1979, as part of a settlement to resolve litigation with southwest airlines, the cities agreed to expand the scope of operations allowed under the bond ordinance at dallas' love field. congress enacted the wright amendment to prevent the federal government from acting inconsistent with this agreement. the wright amendment limited interstate operations at love field to the four states contiguous to texas new mexico, oklahoma, arkansas, and louisiana and prohibited through ticketing to any destination outside that perimeter. in 1997, without the consent of either city, congress amended the wright amendment by i adding three states kansas, mississippi, and alabama to the perimeter and ii removing some federal restrictions on large aircraft configured with 56 seats or less the 1997 amendment . in october 1997, the city of fort worth filed suit in state district court against the city of dallas and others seeking to enforce the bond ordinance. fort worth contends that the 1997 amendment does not preclude the city of dallas from exercising its proprietary rights to restrict traffic at love field in a manner consistent with the bond ordinance and, moreover, that dallas has an obligation to do so. american joined in this litigation. on october 15, 1998, the state district court granted summary judgment in favor of fort worth and american, which summary judgment is being appealed to the fort worth court of appeals. in the same lawsuit, dfw filed claims alleging that irrespective of whether the bond ordinance is enforceable, the dfw use agreement prohibits american and other dfw signatory airlines from moving any interstate operations to love field. these claims remain unresolved. dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of texas, dallas division, seeking to have the court declare that, as a matter of law, the 1997 amendment precludes the city of dallas from exercising any restrictions on operations at love field. further, in may 1998, continental airlines and continental express filed a lawsuit in dallas federal court seeking a judicial declaration that the bond ordinance cannot be enforced to prevent them from operating flights from love field to cleveland using regional jets. these two federal court lawsuits were consolidated and stayed. 9 12 in december 1998, the department of transportation dot issued an order on the federal law questions concerning the bond ordinance, local proprietary powers, dfw's use agreement with dfw carriers such as american, and the wright and 1997 amendments, and concluded that the bond ordinance was preempted by federal law and was therefore not enforceable. the dot also found that the dfw use agreement did not preclude american from conducting interstate operations at love field. fort worth, american and dfw appealed the dot's order to the fifth circuit court of appeals, and on february 1, 2000, the fifth circuit affirmed the dot's order in all respects. on march 3, 2000, fort worth filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court asking the court to review the fifth circuit's decision. on may 1, 2000, american similarly filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court asking the court to review the fifth circuit's decision to the extent it found that the bond ordinance's restrictions on service at love field are preempted. on may 1, 2000, dfw also filed a petition for writ of certiorari asking the supreme court to review the portion of the fifth circuit decision that found that the dfw use agreement was preempted to the extent that it precludes dfw signatory carriers from operating interstate service at love field. in january 2000, the department of justice, at the behest of the dot, filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of texas, dallas division, against fort worth and american seeking to enforce the dot's order and to prevent any party from interfering with any carrier operating under that order. dot subsequently filed a motion for summary judgement which american and fort worth are opposing. on may 1, 2000 american commenced new service from love field to chicago and los angeles using space leased from continental express through may 28, 2000. american is seeking facilities at love field from the city of dallas to use for this new service starting may 29, 2000. as a result of the foregoing, the future of interstate flight operations at love field and american's dfw hub are uncertain. an increase in operations at love field to new interstate destinations and or the inability of american to effectively compete at love field could adversely impact american's business. forward looking information statements in this report contain
