'''
Jump Search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays. 
The basic idea is to check fewer elements (than linear search) 
by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of searching all elements.
STEP 1: Jump from index 0 to index 4;
STEP 2: Jump from index 4 to index 8;
STEP 3: Jump from index 8 to index 12;
STEP 4: Since the element at index 12 is greater than 55 we will jump back a step to come to index 8.
STEP 5: Perform linear search from index 8 to get the element 55.
