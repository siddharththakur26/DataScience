airline group's revenues increased 31 million, or 0.7 percent, in the second quarter of 1999 versus the same period last year. american's passenger revenues decreased by 1.0 percent, or 38 million, compared to the second quarter of 1998. american's yield the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile of 12.97 cents decreased by 4.4 percent compared to the same period in 1998. domestic yields decreased 2.4 percent from the second quarter of 1998. international yields decreased 8.7 percent due to a 11.6 percent decrease in the pacific, a 10.7 percent decrease in europe and a 5.4 percent decrease in latin america. the decrease in domestic yields was due primarily to increased capacity and fare sale activity during the second quarter of 1999, the residual effect of the apa job action from the first quarter of 1999, and the impact of international yield decreases on domestic yields. the decrease in international yields was due primarily to large industry capacity additions and increased fare sale activity in europe. american's traffic or revenue passenger miles rpms increased 3.5 percent to 28.9 billion miles for the quarter ended june 30, 1999. american's capacity or available seat miles asms increased 3.7 percent to 40.4 billion miles in the second quarter of 1999. american's domestic traffic increased 2.7 percent on capacity increases of 4.7 percent and international traffic grew 5.4 percent on capacity increases of 1.6 percent. the increase in international traffic was driven by a 62.3 percent increase in traffic to the pacific on capacity growth of 48.4 percent and a 7.3 percent increase in traffic to europe on capacity growth of 8.1 percent. this increase was partially offset by a 3.8 decrease in traffic to latin america on a capacity decrease of 8.7 percent. american's operations were adversely impacted by several external factors in the second quarter of 1999. first, american experienced record delays and cancellations due to weather, primarily at its dallas fort worth and chicago hubs. in addition, the implementation of the federal aviation administration's new display screen replacement dsr system caused numerous delays and cancellations across american's system as three of the first five centers to receive the new dsr system fort worth, new york, and chicago are high traffic cities in american's network which are responsible for a significant amount of american's traffic. amr eagle's revenues increased 17.6 percent, or 51 million, due primarily to the acquisition of business express, a regional carrier based in the northeast, in march 1999. the airline group's other revenues increased 23 million, or 9.2 percent, primarily as a result of an increase in aircraft maintenance work performed by american for other airlines and increased service contracts, primarily related to ramp and consulting services. the airline group's operating expenses increased 5.9 percent, or 231 million. american's jet operations cost per asm increased 0.6 percent to 9.31 cents. wages, salaries and benefits increased 7.2 percent, or 105 million, primarily due to an increase in the average number of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the company's labor contracts. aircraft fuel expense increased 2.5 percent, or 10 million, due to a 4.8 percent increase in american's fuel consumption, partially offset by a 3.6 percent decrease in american's average price per gallon, including taxes. other rentals and landing fees increased 26 million, or 12.1 percent, due to higher facilities rent and landing fees across american's system. aircraft rentals increased 19 million, or 13.3 percent, due primarily to the addition of reno aircraft. other operating expense increased 76 million, or 10.9 percent, due primarily to an increase in outsourced services, booking fees, aircraft maintenance work performed by american for other airlines, and travel and incidental costs. other expense increased 36.6 percent, or 15 million, primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from lower investment balances and a decline in interest rates. 10 13 results of operations continued sabre financial highlights unaudited dollars in millions three months ended june 30, 1999 1998 revenues 639 577 operating expenses 543 468 operating income

distribution revenues increased approximately 49 million, or 14.5 percent, due to growth in booking fees driven by an increase in booking volumes and an overall increase in the average price per booking due to a price increase implemented in february 1999. the increase in booking fee revenues was also partially driven by an increase in bookings made through sabre's online travel site travelocity.com . revenues from information technology solutions increased approximately 13 million, or 5.5 percent, primarily due to services performed under various information technology outsourcing agreements signed during 1998. expenses operating expenses increased 75 million, or 16.0 percent, due primarily to increases in salaries and benefits expense, subscriber incentive expense, depreciation and amortization, advertising, miscellaneous selling, and product development expenses, and data processing expense. salaries and benefits expense increased due to an increase in the average number of employees necessary to support sabre's business growth, and wage and salary increases for existing employees. subscriber incentive expense increased in order to maintain and expand sabre's travel agency subscriber base and to respond to competitor pressures. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due primarily to the amortization of the deferred asset associated with the stock options granted to us airways, inc. us airways . advertising, miscellaneous selling, and product development expenses increased in order to support sabre's growth initiatives. data processing costs increased due to the growth in bookings and transactions processed. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in contract labor expenses due to a planned reduction in contract labor headcount. 11 14 results of operations continued for the six months ended june 30, 1999 and 1998 summary amr recorded net earnings for the six months ended june 30, 1999 of 426 million, or 2.65 per common share diluted. this compares with net earnings of 699 million, or 3.91 per common share diluted, for the same period in 1998. amr's operating income of 668 million decreased 47.5 percent, or 604 million, compared to 1.3 billion for the same period in 1998. amr's net earnings were adversely impacted by an illegal job action by some members of the apa during the first quarter of 1999, which negatively impacted the company's net earnings by an estimated 140 million, or 0.87 per common share diluted. this was partially offset by the gain on the sale of amr services, amr combs and teleservice resources, and the gain from the sale of the equant n.v. depository certificates, such gains aggregating approximately 101 million after taxes, or 0.63 per common share diluted. airline group financial highlights unaudited dollars in millions six months ended june 30, 1999 1998 revenues passenger american airlines, inc. 7,071 7,367 american eagle 611 545 cargo

year. american's passenger revenues decreased by 4.0 percent, or 296 million, largely as a result of the illegal job action by some members of the apa during the first quarter of 1999. american's yield the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile of 13.05 cents decreased by 5.6 percent compared to the same period in 1998. domestic yields decreased 3.9 percent from the first six months of 1998. international yields decreased 9.4 percent, reflecting a 12.6 percent decrease in the pacific, a 9.1 percent decrease in europe and an 8.3 percent decrease in latin america. the decrease in domestic yield was due primarily to increased capacity and fare sale activity in the first six months of 1999 compared to the same period in 1998, the apa job action, and the impact of international yield decreases on domestic yields. the decrease in international yields was due primarily to weak international economies, large industry capacity additions and increased fare sale activity. american's traffic or revenue passenger miles rpms increased 1.7 percent to 54.2 billion miles for the six months ended june 30, 1999. american's capacity or available seat miles asms increased 1.9 percent to 78.1 billion miles in the first six months of 1999. american's domestic traffic increased 1.4 percent on capacity growth of 1.9 percent and international traffic grew 2.3 percent on capacity increases of 1.9 percent. the increase in international traffic was driven by a 50.0 percent increase in traffic to the pacific on capacity growth of 59.6 percent and a 2.8 percent increase in traffic to europe on capacity growth of 5.8 percent. this was partially offset by a 4.0 percent decrease in traffic to latin america on a capacity decline of 7.1 percent. american's operations were adversely impacted by several external factors in the second quarter of 1999. first, american experienced record delays and cancellations due to weather, primarily at its dallas fort worth and chicago

the first five centers to receive the new dsr system fort worth, new york, and chicago are high traffic cities in american's network which are responsible for a significant amount of american's traffic. amr eagle's revenues increased 12.1 percent, or 66 million, due primarily to the acquisition of business express in march 1999. the airline group's other revenues increased 46 million, or 9.5 percent, primarily as a result of an increase in aircraft maintenance work performed by american for other airlines and increased service contracts, primarily related to ramp and consulting services. the airline group's operating expenses increased 5.0 percent, or 383 million. american's jet operations cost per asm increased by 1.7 percent to 9.46 cents. wages, salaries and benefits increased 183 million, or 6.5 percent, primarily due to an increase in the average number of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the company's labor contracts. aircraft fuel expense decreased 6.8 percent, or 56 million, due to a 10.4 percent decrease in american's average price per gallon, including taxes, partially offset by a 2.9 percent increase in american's fuel consumption. other rentals and landing fees increased 50 million, or 11.9 percent, due to higher facilities rent and landing fees across american's system. aircraft rentals increased 37 million, or 13.0 percent, due primarily to the addition of reno aircraft. other operating expense increased 161 million, or 11.5 percent, due primarily to an increase in outsourced services, booking fees, aircraft maintenance work performed by american for other airlines, and travel and incidental costs. other expense decreased 39.8 percent, or 41 million, due to an increase in capitalized interest on aircraft purchase deposits and a 31 million gain on the sale of a portion of american's interest in equant n.v., partially offset by a decrease in interest income resulting from lower investment balances and a decline in interest rates. 14 17 results of operations continued sabre financial highlights unaudited dollars in millions six months ended june 30, 1999 1998

for sabre increased 146 million, or 12.9 percent. electronic travel distribution revenues increased approximately 85 million, or 12.4 percent, due to growth in booking fees driven by an increase in booking volumes and an overall increase in the average price per booking due to a price increase implemented in february 1999. the increase in booking fee revenues was also partially driven by an increase in bookings made through the travelocity.com site. revenues from information technology solutions increased approximately 61 million, or 13.6 percent, primarily due to services performed under the information technology services agreement with us airways and services performed under other information technology outsourcing agreements signed during 1998. expenses operating expenses increased 162 million, or 17.9 percent, due primarily to increases in salaries, benefits and employee related costs, subscriber incentive expense, depreciation and amortization, advertising and miscellaneous selling expenses, and data processing costs. salaries, benefits and employee related costs increased due to an increase in the average number of employees necessary to support sabre's business growth, and wage and salary increases for existing employees. subscriber incentive expense increased in order to maintain and expand sabre's travel agency subscriber base and to respond to competitor pressures. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due primarily to the amortization of the deferred asset associated with the stock options granted to us airways, the acquisition of information technology assets to support the us airways' contract, and normal additions. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense due to the sale of data center mainframe equipment to an unrelated party in october 1998. advertising and miscellaneous selling expenses increased in order to support the company's growth initiatives. data processing costs increased due to the growth in bookings and transactions processed. in an effort to balance costs with revenue growth, and as a result of certain inefficiencies uncovered after sabre's march 1999 reorganization, sabre is reviewing a number of alternatives aimed at strategically managing costs and improving operating margins in the latter half of 1999. such alternatives may result in headcount reductions in certain areas, reduced spending on discretionary items, and prioritization and streamlining of current development projects in order to focus resources on those that provide the best long term solution. sabre intends to implement such measures without compromising the service levels or commitments to its existing customers or reducing sales and marketing efforts to continue to grow the outsourcing business. other income other income increased 38 million primarily due to a 35 million gain on the sale of equant n.v. depository certificates held by american for the economic benefit of sabre. 15 18 liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities in the six month period ended june 30, 1999 was 1.3 billion, a decrease of 44 million over the same period in 1998. this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in net earnings, partially offset by an increase in the air traffic liability due to higher advanced sales. capital expenditures for the first six months of 1999 were 2.1 billion, and included the acquisition of 12 boeing 737 800s, 10 boeing 777 200igws, six boeing 757 200s, four boeing 767 300ers and 13 embraer 145 aircraft. these capital expenditures were financed with internally generated cash, except for 12 boeing aircraft which were financed through secured mortgage agreements, one boeing aircraft which was financed through a sale leaseback transaction, and the embraer aircraft which were funded through secured debt agreements. as of june 30, 1999, the company had commitments to acquire the following aircraft 91 boeing 737 800s, 24 boeing 777 200igws, 95 embraer emb 135s, 25 bombardier crj 700s and 17 embraer emb 145s. in july 1999, the company exercised its purchase rights to acquire three additional boeing 777 200igws. deliveries of these aircraft will extend through 2006. payments for these aircraft will approximate 1.4 billion during the remainder of 1999, 2.2 billion in 2000, 1.9 billion in 2001 and an aggregate of approximately 1.5 billion in 2002 through 2006. the company expects to fund its remaining 1999 capital expenditures from the company's existing cash and short term investments, internally generated cash, and new financing depending upon capital market conditions and the company's evolving view of its long term needs. in april 1999, the company announced that it will accelerate the retirement of nine mcdonnell douglas dc 10 and 16 boeing 727 200 aircraft earlier than anticipated, thereby eliminating american's entire dc 10 fleet by the end of 2000 and advancing the retirement of the boeing 727 fleet to the end of 2003. on july 13, 1999, the company issued 150 million of unsecured debt bearing interest at 7.875 percent, maturing on july 13, 2039, and is callable at par after july 13, 2004. during the six months ended june 30, 1999, the company purchased approximately 10.7 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately 664 million. additional share repurchases of up to 241 million, which is the remaining amount currently authorized by the company's board of directors, may be made from time to time, depending on market conditions, and may be discontinued at any time. in march 1999, sabre's board of directors authorized, subject to certain business and market conditions, the repurchase of up to 1.0 million shares of sabre's class a common stock. during the six months ended june 30, 1999, sabre purchased approximately 545,000 shares at a cost of approximately 32 million. in connection with a secondary offering by equant n.v. in february 1999, the company sold approximately 923,000 depository certificates for proceeds of 66 million. during the first six months of 1999, the company acquired approximately 400,000 depository certificates from other airlines. in addition, based upon a reallocation between the owners of the certificates in july 1999, the company received an additional 2.6 million certificates. accordingly, as of july 30, 1999, the company holds approximately 5.3 million depository certificates with an estimated market value of approximately 474 million. 16 19 year 2000 readiness state of readiness in 1995, the company implemented a project the year 2000 project to ensure that hardware and software systems operated by the company, including software licensed to or operated for third parties by sabre, are designed to operate and properly manage dates beyond december 31, 1999 year 2000 readiness . the year 2000 project consists of six phases i awareness, ii assessment, iii analysis, design and remediation, iv testing and validation, v quality assurance review to ensure consistency throughout the year 2000 project and vi creation of business continuity strategy, including plans in the event of year 2000 failures. in developing the company's proprietary software analysis, remediation and testing methodology for year 2000 readiness, it studied the best practices of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers and the british standards institution. the company has assessed i the company's over 1,000 information technology and operating systems that will be utilized after december 31, 1999 it systems ii non information technology systems, including embedded technology, facilities, and other systems non it systems and iii the year 2000 readiness of its critical third party service providers. it systems the company has completed the first three phases of the year 2000 project for all of its it systems. the company has successfully completed the testing and validation phase and quality assurance review phase for 99 percent of its it systems, including its computer reservations and flight operating systems that perform such mission critical functions as passenger bookings, ticketing, passenger check in, aircraft weight and balance, flight planning and baggage and cargo processing. as of july 1, 1999, approximately 43 percent of those it systems including the computer reservations systems are already successfully processing year 2000 dates in actual use. using dedicated testing environments and applying rigorous test standards, the company is actively testing the remaining one percent of its it systems to determine if they are year 2000 ready or if further remediation is necessary. the company estimates completing the testing and validation phase and quality assurance review phase, and the business continuity phase for its remaining it systems during the third quarter of 1999. non it systems the company has completed the first five phases of the year 2000 project for 99 percent of its non it systems, such as aircraft avionics and flight simulators. the company estimates completing the final phase of business continuity for its non it systems during the third quarter of 1999. third party services the company's business is dependent upon entities which supply critical infrastructure to the airline industry, such as the air traffic control and related systems of the federal aviation administration and international aviation authorities, the department of transportation, and airport authorities. those service providers depend on their hardware and software systems and on interfaces with the company's it systems. the company is actively involved in the air transport association ata and the international air transport association iata year 2000 airline industry program to ensure the readiness of airports, air traffic service providers, and commercial airline suppliers worldwide. as part of this program, the ata and iata are monitoring approximately 2,500 airports, 185 air traffic control service providers, and more than 5,000 commercial airline suppliers throughout the world regarding their year 2000 readiness. the results of these studies indicate that a majority of the domestic and international airports in which american operates have made significant progress towards their year 2000 readiness. nevertheless, the company continues to closely monitor the progress of a number of key airports that, if not properly prepared for the year 2000, could disrupt the company's ability to provide services to its customers. in addition, the company relies on third party service providers for many services, such as telecommunications, electrical power, and data and credit card transaction processing. those service providers depend on their hardware and software systems and on interfaces with the company's it systems. the company is monitoring its critical service providers regarding their year 2000 readiness and has received responses from approximately 87 percent of its critical service providers. such respondents assured the company that their software and hardware is or will be year 2000 ready. to the extent practical, the company will implement contingencies for the third party critical service providers that have not responded. the company does not expect the year 2000 issues it might encounter with third parties to be materially different from those encountered by other airlines, including the company's competitors. 17 20 costs of year 2000 project the company expects to incur significant hardware, software and labor costs, as well as consulting and other expenses, in its year 2000 project. the company's total estimated cost of the project is 215 to 220 million, of which approximately 204 million was incurred as of june 30, 1999. costs associated with the year 2000 project are expensed as incurred, other than capitalized hardware costs, and have been funded through cash from operations. risks of year 2000 non readiness the economy in general, and the travel and transportation industries in particular, may be adversely affected by risks associated with the year 2000. the company's business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if systems that it operates or systems that are operated by third party service providers upon which the company relies are not year 2000 ready in time. there can be no assurance that these systems will continue to properly function and interface and will otherwise be year 2000 ready. management believes that its most likely year 2000 risks relate to the failure of third parties with whom it has material relationships to be year 2000 ready. although the company is not aware of any threatened claims related to the year 2000, the company may be subject to litigation arising from such claims and, depending on the outcome, such litigation could have a material adverse affect on the company. there can be no assurance that the company's insurance coverage would be adequate to offset these and other business risks related to the year 2000 issue. business continuity plans the company has identified four potential risk areas related to the year 2000 and is developing and refining plans to continue its business in the event of year 2000 failures in response to those risks. the company believes that its most likely year 2000 risks relate to the failure of third parties with whom it has material relationships to be year 2000 compliant. in response to this risk, the company has been actively participating with the ata and iata year 2000 airline industry program to ensure the readiness of airports and air traffic services worldwide. the company is in the process of collecting additional business continuity information from such suppliers in order to effectively manage any failures. the second risk area relates to the effective prioritization and management of any year 2000 failures. the company is establishing an enterprise command center in order to prioritize issues, manage resources, coordinate problem resolution and communicate status in the event of year 2000 failures. the third risk area relates to the possibility that the company's employees will fail to report to work on or around december 31, 1999, thereby potentially disrupting the company's operations. in order to mitigate such risk, american may voluntarily reduce its schedule during this timeframe. the fourth risk area relates to the failure of critical internal business processes, services, systems and facilities. although the company has tested all systems including those not impacted by dates, the company is developing business continuity plans to manage potential internal year 2000 failures and expects to complete these plans by september 30, 1999. the company's business continuity plans include performing certain processes manually maintaining dedicated staff to be available at crucial dates to remedy unforeseen problems installing defensive code to protect real time systems from improperly formatted date data supplied by third parties repairing or obtaining replacement systems and reducing or suspending certain non critical aspects of the company's services or operations. because of the pervasiveness and complexity of the year 2000 issue, and in particular the uncertainty concerning the efforts and success of third parties to be year 2000 compliant, the company will continue to refine its contingency plans during 1999. the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year 2000 readiness program are based on management's best estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources, third party modification plans and other factors. even though the company has met all established deadlines and the cost estimates have remained constant, actual results could differ materially from these estimates. specific

operate dallas fort worth airport dfw , a bond ordinance was enacted by both cities the bond ordinance . the bond ordinance required both cities to direct all scheduled interstate passenger operations to dfw and was an integral part of the bonds issued for the construction and operation of dfw. in 1979, as part of a settlement to resolve litigation with southwest airlines, the cities agreed to expand the scope of operations allowed under the bond ordinance at dallas' love field. congress enacted the wright amendment to prevent the federal government from acting inconsistent with this agreement. the wright amendment limited interstate operations at love field to the four states contiguous to texas new mexico, oklahoma, arkansas and louisiana and prohibited through ticketing to any destination outside that perimeter. in 1997, without the consent of either city, congress amended the wright amendment by i adding three states kansas, mississippi and alabama to the perimeter and ii removing some federal restrictions on large aircraft configured with 56 seats or less the 1997 amendment . in october 1997, the city of fort worth filed suit in state district court against the city of dallas and others seeking to enforce the bond ordinance. fort worth contends that the 1997 amendment does not preclude the city of dallas from exercising its proprietary rights to restrict traffic at love field in a manner consistent with the bond ordinance and, moreover, that dallas has an obligation to do so. american joined in this litigation. on october 15, 1998, the state district court granted summary judgment in favor of fort worth and american, which summary judgment is being appealed to the fort worth court of appeals. in the same lawsuit, dfw filed claims alleging that irrespective of whether the bond ordinance is enforceable, the dfw use agreement prohibits american and other dfw signatory airlines from moving any interstate operations to love field. these claims remain unresolved. dallas filed a separate declaratory judgment action in federal district court seeking to have the court declare that, as a matter of law, the 1997 amendment precludes dallas from exercising any restrictions on operations at love field. further, in may 1998, continental airlines and continental express filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking a judicial declaration that the bond ordinance cannot be enforced to prevent them from operating flights from love field to cleveland using regional jets. in december 1998, the department of transportation dot issued an order on the federal law questions concerning the bond ordinance, local proprietary powers, dfw's use agreement with dfw carriers such as american, and the wright and 1997 amendments, and concluded that the bond ordinance was preempted by federal law and was therefore, not enforceable. the dot also found that the dfw use agreement did not preclude american from conducting interstate operations at love field. fort worth, american and dfw have appealed the dot's order to the fifth circuit court of appeals. as a result of the foregoing, the future of interstate flight operations at love field and american's dfw hub are uncertain. an increase in operations at love field to new interstate destinations could adversely impact american's business. forward looking information statements in this report contain
