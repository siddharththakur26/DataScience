following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected historical financial data and our accompanying financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this document. the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed under item 1a. risk factors. 32 table of contents overview of our business we are a multi faceted oilfield services company that provides services and equipment to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies throughout the united states, including texas, louisiana, new mexico, colorado, oklahoma, mississippi, wyoming, arkansas, west virginia, offshore in the gulf of mexico, and internationally, primarily in argentina and mexico. we operate in six sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry rental services international drilling directional drilling tubular services underbalanced drilling and production services. we derive operating revenues from rates per job that we charge for the labor and equipment required to provide a service and rates per day for equipment and tools that we rent to our customers. the price we charge for our services depends upon several factors, including the level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular geographic regions in which we operate. contracts are awarded based on the price, quality of service and equipment, and the general reputation and experience of our personnel. the demand for drilling services has historically been volatile and is affected by the capital expenditures of oil and natural gas exploration and development companies, which can fluctuate based upon the prices of oil and natural gas or the expectation for the prices of oil and natural gas. the number of working drilling rigs, typically referred to as the rig count, is an important indicator of activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry. the rig count in the united states increased from 862 as of december 31, 2002 to 1,763 as of february 29, 2008, according to the baker hughes rig count. furthermore, directional and horizontal rig counts increased from 283 as of december 31, 2002 to 817 as of february 29, 2008, which accounted for 33 and 46 of the total u.s. rig count, respectively. the offshore gulf of mexico rig count, however, decreased to 58 rigs at february 29, 2008 from 90 rigs one year earlier. we believe this is due to the relocation of rigs to international markets as a result of the high oil prices. our cost of revenues represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our equipment. the principal elements of these costs are direct and indirect labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment, insurance, equipment rentals, fuel and depreciation. operating expenses do not fluctuate in direct proportion to changes in revenues because, among other factors, we have a fixed base of inventory of equipment and facilities to support our operations, and in periods of low drilling activity we may also seek to preserve labor continuity to market our services and maintain our equipment. results of operations in april 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of delta and, in may 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of capcoil. we report the operations of downhole and capcoil in our production services segment and the operations of safco and delta in our rental services segment. in july 2005, we acquired the 45 interest of m i in our underbalanced drilling subsidiary, aircomp, making us the 100 owner of aircomp. in addition, in july 2005, we acquired the underbalanced drilling assets of w. t. on august 1, 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of target. we included target results in our directional drilling segment because target s measurement while drilling equipment is utilized in that segment. on september 1, 2005, we acquired the casing and tubing service assets of patterson services, inc. we consolidated the results of these acquisitions from the day they were acquired. in january 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of specialty and in december 2006, we acquired substantially all of the assets of ogr. we report the operations of specialty and ogr in our rental services segment. in april 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of rogers. we report the operations of rogers in our tubular services segment. in august 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of dls and in december 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of tanus. we report the operations of dls and tanus in our international drilling segment. in october 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of petro rentals. we report the operations of petro rentals in our production services segment. we consolidated the results of these acquisitions from the day they were acquired. in june 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of coker and in july 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of diggar and in november 2007, we acquired substantially all of the assets of diamondback. we report the operations of coker, diggar and diamondback in our directional drilling segment. in october 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of rebel. we report the operations of 33 table of contents rebel in our tubular services segment. we consolidated the results of these acquisitions from the day they were acquired. the foregoing acquisitions affect the comparability from period to period of our historical results, and our historical results may not be indicative of our future results. comparison of years ended december 31, 2007 and december 31, 2006 our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2007 were 571.0 million, an increase of 83.6 compared to 311.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2006. revenues increased in all of our business segments due principally to the acquisitions completed during the two year period ended december 31, 2007, the investment in new equipment and the opening of new operating locations. the most significant increase in revenues was due to the acquisition of dls on august 14, 2006 which established our international drilling segment. revenues also increased significantly at our rental services segment due to the acquisition of the ogr assets on december 18, 2006. our directional drilling segment revenues increased in the 2007 period compared to the 2006 period due to acquisitions completed in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 which added downhole motors, measurement while drilling, or mwd, tools, and directional drilling personnel resulting in increased capacity and increased market penetration. revenues increased at our underbalanced drilling segment due to the purchase of additional equipment, principally new compressor packages, and expansion of operations into new geographic regions. our gross margin for the year ended december 31, 2007 increased 69.9 to 178.6 million, or 31.3 of revenues, compared to 105.1 million, or 33.8 , of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006. the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in revenues in all of our business segments. the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the 151.3 increase in depreciation expense to 50.9 million in 2007 from 20.3 million in 2006. the increase in depreciation expense is due to the acquisition of the ogr assets, the acquisition of dls and our capital expenditures. our cost of revenues consists principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of our equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. because many of our costs are fixed, our gross profit as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues. general and administrative expense was 58.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2007 compared to 35.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2006. general and administrative expense increased due to the acquisitions, and the hiring of additional sales, operations, accounting and administrative personnel. as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 10.3 in 2007 compared to 11.4 in 2006. general and administrative expense includes share based compensation expense of 4.7 million in 2007 and 3.0 million in 2006. on june 29, 2007, we sold our capillary tubing assets that were part of our production services segment. the total consideration was approximately 16.3 million in cash. we recognized a gain of 8.9 million related to the sale of these assets. amortization expense was 4.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2007 compared to 1.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2006. the increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions. income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2007 totaled 124.8 million, an 84.2 increase over the 67.7 million in income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2006, reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross profit, offset in part by increased general and administrative expense and amortization expense. our income from operations as a percentage of revenues increased slightly to 21.9 in 2007 from 21.8 in 2006. income from operations in the 2007 period includes an 8.9 million gain from the sale of our capillary tubing assets in the second quarter of 2007. our net interest expense was 46.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, compared to 20.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2006. interest expense increased in 2007 due to our increased debt. in august 2006 we issued 95.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at 9.0 to fund a portion of the acquisition of dls. in january 2007 we issued 250.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at 8.5 to pay off, in part, the 300.0 million bridge loan utilized to complete the ogr acquisition and for working capital. this bridge loan was repaid on january 29, 2007. the average interest rate on the bridge loan was 34 table of contents approximately 10.6 . interest expense for 2007 includes the write off of deferred financing fees of 1.2 million related to the repayment of the bridge loan. interest expense includes amortization expense of deferred financing costs of 1.9 million and 1.5 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2007 was 28.8 million, or 36.4 of our net income before income taxes, compared to 11.4 million, or 24.3 of our net income before income taxes for 2006. the increase in our provision for income taxes is attributable to the increase in our operating income and a higher effective tax rate. the effective tax rate in 2006 was favorably impacted by the reversal of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. the valuation allowance was reversed due to operating results that allowed for the realization of our deferred tax assets. we had net income attributed to common stockholders of 50.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, an increase of 41.6 , compared to net income attributed to common stockholders of 35.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2006. the following table compares revenues and income from operations for each of our business segments for the years ended december 31, 2007 and december 31, 2006. income from operations consists of our revenues less cost of revenues, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and

revenues were 121.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, an increase of 135.2 from the 51.5 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006. income from operations increased 86.9 to 49.1 million in 2007 compared to 26.3 million in 2006. the increase in revenue and operating income is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the ogr assets in december 2006. income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to 40.5 for 2007 compared to 51.0 for the prior year as a result of higher depreciation expense associated with the ogr acquisition and capital expenditures. rental services revenues and operating income was impacted by a more competitive market environment due to the decreased u.s. gulf of mexico drilling activity in the last half of 2007 due to the hurricane season and the departure of drilling rigs in favor of the international markets. international drilling. on august 14, 2006, we acquired dls which established our international drilling segment. our international drilling revenues were 215.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, an increase from the 69.5 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006. income from operations increased to 38.8 million in 2007 compared to 12.2 million in 2006. income from operations as percentage of revenue increased to 18.0 for 2007 compared to 17.6 for 2006. during 2007 we placed orders for 16 service rigs workover rigs and pulling rigs and four drilling rigs. four of the service rigs were delivered in the fourth quarter of 2007. we expect all the rigs to be placed in service during the first three quarters of 2008. directional drilling. revenues for the year ended december 31, 2007 for our directional drilling segment were 96.1 million, an increase of 25.6 from the 76.5 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006. the increase in revenues is due to the purchase of additional mwd tools and the benefit of acquisitions completed in the last half of 2007 which added downhole motors, mwds, and directional drillers. the additional equipment and personnel enabled us to strengthen our presence in new geographic markets and increase our market penetration. income from operations increased 6.7 to 18.8 million for 35 table of contents 2007 from 17.7 million for 2006. income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to 19.6 for 2007 compared to 23.1 for the prior year. the decrease in our operating margin a percentage of revenues is due to increased expenses for downhole motor rentals and repairs, experienced primarily in the first three quarters of 2007 prior to the recent additions to our downhole motor fleet, increased personnel costs and increased depreciation expense. tubular services. revenues for the year ended december 31, 2007 for the tubular services segment were 53.5 million, an increase of 5.2 from the 50.9 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006. revenues from domestic operations increased to 45.6 million in 2007 from 44.4 million in 2006 as a result of the investment in new equipment and the acquisition of rogers in april 2006. revenues from mexican operations increased to 7.9 million in 2007 from 6.5 million in 2006. income from operations decreased 14.3 to 10.7 million in 2007 from 12.5 million in 2006. income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to 20.1 for 2007 compared to 24.7 for the prior year. the results of our tubular services segment were impacted by an increasingly competitive environment domestically for casing and tubing services, exacerbated by the decline in drilling activity in the u.s. gulf of mexico in the last half of 2007, and decreased sales of power tongs in 2007 compared to 2006. while revenues from mexican operations increased 21.5 in 2007 compared to 2006, they were impacted in the fourth quarter of 2007, by severe weather and flooding in mexico. underbalanced drilling. our underbalanced drilling revenues were 51.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, an increase of 18.4 compared to 43.0 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006. income from operations increased 21.1 to 13.1 million in 2007 compared to income from operations of 10.8 million in 2006. income from operations as a percentage of revenues increased slightly to 25.7 in 2007 from 25.1 in 2006. our underbalanced drilling revenues and operating income for the 2007 period increased compared to the 2006 period due in part to our investment in additional equipment, principally new compressors and new foam units. during 2007 underbalanced drilling was affected by a decrease in drilling activity in certain geographic areas by some of our customers, offset by an increased market presence and growth in drilling activity in other, more attractive geographic areas. production services segment. our production services revenues were 33.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2007, compared to 19.6 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006. income from operations was 10.5 million in 2007 compared to income from operations of 2.1 million in 2006. revenues for 2007 increased compared to 2006 due primarily to our acquisition of petro rentals on october 17, 2006, the addition of two coil tubing units in the fourth quarter of 2006, one unit in the first quarter of 2007 and one additional unit delivered at the end of the second quarter of 2007, offset in part by the sale of our capillary tubing assets in june 2007. the increase in income from operations can be attributed to an 8.9 million gain on sale of our capillary tubing assets. during 2007 our production services segment experienced delays in the delivery and activation of new coil tubing units. as a result, we experienced low utilization for our coil tubing units and increases in personnel expenses, including increased lodging, relocation and training expenses for the crews without the benefit of corresponding increases in revenues. comparison of years ended december 31, 2006 and december 31, 2005 our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006 was 311.0 million, an increase of 187.9 compared to 108.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. revenues increased in all of our business segments due to the successful integration of acquisitions completed in the third quarter of 2005 and during 2006, the investment in new equipment, improved pricing for our services, the addition of operations and sales personnel and the opening of new operations offices. revenues increased most significantly due to the acquisition of dls on august 14, 2006 which expanded our operations to a sixth operating segment, international drilling. revenues also increased significantly at our rental services segment due to the acquisition of specialty effective january 1, 2006. our tubular services segment also had a substantial increase in revenue, primarily due to the acquisitions of the casing and tubing assets of patterson services, inc. on september 1, 2005, and the acquisition of rogers as of april 1, 2006, along with the investment in additional equipment, improved market conditions and increased market penetration for our services in south texas, east texas, louisiana and the u.s. gulf of mexico. revenues increased at our underbalanced drilling segment due to the purchase of additional equipment and improved pricing for our services. our directional drilling segment revenues 36 table of contents increased in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period due to improved pricing for directional drilling services, the august 2005 acquisition of target which provides mwd tools and the purchase of additional down hole motors and mwds which increased our capacity and market presence. our gross margin for the year ended december 31, 2006 increased 243.8 to 105.1 million, or 33.8 of revenues, compared to 30.6 million, or 28.3 , of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in revenues in all of our business segments. the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the acquisition of specialty as of january 1, 2006, in the high margin rental tool business, the improved pricing for our services generally and the investments in new capital equipment. also contributing to our improved gross profit margin was the acquisition of target, the purchase of additional mwd s and the acquisition of rogers. the increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of 315.7 to 20.3 million compared to 4.9 million for 2005. the increase is due to additional depreciable assets resulting from the acquisitions and capital expenditures. our cost of revenues consists principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of our equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. because many of our costs are fixed, our gross profit as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues. general and administrative expense was 35.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2006 compared to 15.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. general and administrative expense increased due to additional expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the hiring of additional sales, operations and administrative personnel. general and administrative expense also increased because of increased accounting and consulting fees and other expenses in connection with initiatives to strengthen our internal control processes, costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and increased corporate accounting and administrative staff. as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 11.4 in 2006 compared to 14.4 in 2005. we adopted sfas no. 123r, share based payment, effective january 1, 2006. this statement requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. we adopted sfas no. 123r using the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the black scholes option pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. under the modified prospective method, we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of december 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining vesting periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. therefore, we recorded an expense of 3.4 million related to stock awards for the year ended december 31, 2006 of which 3.0 million was recorded in general and administrative expense with the balance being recorded as a direct cost. prior to january 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock based compensation using accounting principle board opinion no. 25, or apb no. 25. under apb no. 25, compensation expense is recognized for stock options with an exercise price that is less than the market price on the grant date of the option. accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized under apb no. 25. amortization expense was 1.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2006 compared to 1.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions. income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2006 totaled 67.7 million, a 401.0 increase over the 13.5 million in income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2005, reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross profit, offset in part by increased general and administrative expenses. our income from operations as a percentage of revenues increased to 21.8 in 2006 from 12.5 in 2005 due to the increase in our gross margin which offset the increases in amortization expense and general and administrative expenses. our net interest expense was 20.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, compared to 4.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. interest expense increased in 2006 due to our increased debt. in january of 2006 we issued 160.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at 9.0 to fund the acquisition of specialty, pay off other outstanding debt and for working capital. in august 2006 we issued an additional 95.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at 9.0 to fund a portion of the acquisition of dls. on december 18, 2006, we borrowed 300.0 million in a senior unsecured bridge loan to fund the acquisition 37 table of contents of ogr. the average interest rate on the bridge loan was approximately 10.6 . interest expense for 2006 includes the write off of 453,000 related to financing fees on the bridge loan. this bridge loan was repaid on january 29, 2007 and the remaining 1.2 million of financing fees were written off in 2007. in the third quarter of 2005, we incurred debt retirement expense of 1.1 million related to the refinancing of our debt. this amount includes prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred financing fees from a previous financing. minority interest in income of subsidiaries for the year ended december 31, 2006 was 0 compared to 488,000 for the corresponding period in 2005 due to the our acquisition of the minority interest at aircomp on july 11, 2005. our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2006 was 11.4 million, or 24.3 of our net income before income taxes, compared to 1.3 million, or 15.8 of our net income before income taxes for 2005. the increase in our provision for income taxes is attributable to the significant increase in our operating income which resulted in the utilization of our deferred tax assets including our net operating losses, and the increase in percentage of income taxes to net income before income taxes attributable to our operations in argentina which are taxed at 35.0 . we had net income attributed to common stockholders of 35.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of 396.5 , compared to net income attributed to common stockholders of 7.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the following table compares revenues and income from operations for each of our business segments for the years ended december 31, 2006 and december 31, 2005. income from

for the year ended december 31, 2005. income from operations increased to 26.3 million in 2006 compared to 1.3 million in 2005. the increase in revenue and operating income is primarily attributable to the acquisition of specialty effective january 1, 2006, improved pricing, improved utilization of our inventory of rental equipment and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of the ogr assets in december 2006. international drilling segment. our international drilling revenues were 69.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, and our income from operations was 12.2 million. this segment of our operations was created with the acquisition of dls in august of 2006. directional drilling segment. revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006 for our directional drilling segment were 76.5

each drawdown shall be repaid over four years in equal semi annual instalments beginning one year after each disbursement with the final principal payment due not later than march 15, 2013. interest is payable every six months. the import finance facility is unsecured and contains customary events of default and financial covenants and limits dls ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, create liens and sell assets. critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. our preparation of this report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. allowance for doubtful accounts. the determination of the collectibility of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends, including monitoring our customer payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectibility is reasonably assured, as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our customers operate. those uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our customers ability to 45 table of contents pay amounts due us in order to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident that the customers will not be able to make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. revenue recognition. we provide rental equipment and drilling services to our customers at per day, or daywork, and per job contractual rates and recognize the drilling related revenue as the work progresses and when collectibility is reasonably assured. revenue from daywork contracts is recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned. on daywork contracts, revenue is recognized based on the number of days completed at fixed rates stipulated by the contract. for certain contracts, we receive lump sum and other fees for equipment and other mobilization costs. mobilization fees and the related costs are deferred and amortized over the contract terms when material. the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no. 104, revenue recognition in financial statements, provides guidance on the sec staff s views on application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues. our revenue recognition policy is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no. 104. impairment of long lived assets. long lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, comprise a significant amount of our total assets. we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives. additionally, the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable. this requires us to make long term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. these forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. goodwill and other intangibles. as of december 31, 2007, we have recorded approximately 138.4 million of goodwill and 35.2 million of other identifiable intangible assets. we perform purchase price allocations to intangible assets when we make a business combination. business combinations and purchase price allocations have been consummated for acquisitions in all of our reportable segments. the excess of the purchase price after allocation of fair values to tangible assets is allocated to identifiable intangibles and thereafter to goodwill. subsequently, we perform our initial impairment tests and annual impairment tests in accordance with financial accounting standards board no. 141, business combinations, and financial accounting standards board no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets. these initial valuations used two approaches to determine the carrying amount of the individual reporting units. the first approach is the discounted cash flow method, which focuses on our expected cash flow. in applying this approach, the cash flow available for distribution is projected for a finite period of years. cash flow available for distribution is defined as the amount of cash that could be distributed as a dividend without impairing our future profitability or operations. the cash flow available for distribution and the terminal value our value at the end of the estimation period are then discounted to present value to derive an indication of value of the business enterprise. this valuation method is dependent upon the assumptions made regarding future cash flow and cash requirements. the second approach is the guideline company method which focuses on comparing us to selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies. under this method, valuation multiples are i derived from operating data of selected similar companies ii evaluated and adjusted based on our strengths and weaknesses relative to the selected guideline companies and iii applied to our operating data to arrive at an indication of value. this valuation method is dependent upon the assumption that our value can be evaluated by analysis of our earnings and our strengths and weaknesses relative to the selected similar companies. significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. income taxes. the determination and evaluation of our annual income tax provision involves the interpretation of tax laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of income, deductions and tax credits. changes in tax laws, regulations and our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction may impact our tax liability in any given year. while our annual tax provision is based on the information available to us at the time, a number of years may elapse before the 46 table of contents ultimate tax liabilities in certain tax jurisdictions are determined. current income tax expense reflects an estimate of our income tax liability for the current year, withholding taxes, changes in tax rates and changes in prior year tax estimates as returns are filed. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect at year end. a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. we provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to fasb interpretation no. 48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109. it is our intention to permanently reinvest all of the undistributed earnings of our non u.s. subsidiaries in such subsidiaries. accordingly, we have not provided for u.s. deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings of our non u.s. subsidiaries. if a distribution is made to us from the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries, we could be required to record additional taxes. because we cannot predict when, if at all, we will make a distribution of these undistributed earnings, we are unable to make a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability. recently issued accounting standards in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 157, fair value measurements. sfas no. 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. sfas no. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. subsequently, the fasb provided for a one year deferral of the provisions of statement no. 157 for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a non recurring basis. we believe that the adoption of sfas no. 157 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 141 r , business combinations. this statement retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no. 141, business combinations that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and expands the same method of accounting to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses or assets at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. this statement replaces sfas no. 141 by requiring measurement at the acquisition date of the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest. additionally, sfas no. 141 r requires that acquisition related costs, including restructuring costs, be recognized as expense separately from the acquisition. sfas no. 141 r applies prospectively to business combinations for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2008. we will adopt sfas no. 141 r beginning january 1, 2009 and apply to future acquisitions. in february 2007, the fasb issued statement no. 159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities, which permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. upon adoption of sfas no. 159, an entity may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at the adoption date. subsequent to the initial adoption, the election of the fair value option should only be made at the initial recognition of the asset or liability or upon a re measurement event that gives rise to the new basis of accounting. all subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument are reported in earnings. sfas no. 159 does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be recorded at fair value nor does it eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards. sfas no. 159 is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first fiscal year that begins after november 15, 2007. we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no. 159 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements. in december 2007, the fasb issued sfas no. 160, non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no. 51. sfas no. 160 requires i that non controlling minority interests be reported as a component of shareholders equity, ii that net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest be separately identified in the consolidated statement of operations, iii that changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest be accounted for as 47 table of contents equity transactions, iv that any retained non controlling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary be initially measured at fair value, and v that sufficient disclosures are provided that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non controlling owners. sfas no. 160 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2008 and should be applied prospectively. the presentation and disclosure requirements of the statement shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. we believe the adoption of sfas no. 160 will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements, other than normal operating leases and employee contracts, that have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. we have a 90.0 million revolving line of credit with a maturity of january 2010. at december 31, 2007, no amounts were borrowed on the facility but availability is reduced by outstanding letters of credit of 8.4 million. we do not guarantee obligations of any unconsolidated entities.
