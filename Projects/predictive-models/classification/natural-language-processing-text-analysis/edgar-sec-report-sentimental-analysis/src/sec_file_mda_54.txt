item 2. management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information regarding the contract contingencies. american airlines, inc. notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited on december 18, 2007, the european commission issued a statement of objection so against 26 airlines, including the company. the so alleges that these carriers participated in a conspiracy to set surcharges on cargo shipments in violation of eu law. the so states that, in the event that the allegations in the so are affirmed, the commission will impose fines against the company. the company intends to vigorously contest the allegations and findings in the so under eu laws, and it intends to cooperate fully with all other pending investigations. based on the information to date, the company has not recorded any reserve for this exposure for the quarter ended september 30, 2008. in the event that the so is affirmed or other investigations uncover violations of the u.s. antitrust laws or the competition laws of some other jurisdiction, or if the company were named and found liable in any litigation based on these allegations, such findings and related legal proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the company. 4. accumulated depreciation of owned equipment and property at september 30, 2008 and december 31, 2007 was 8.8 billion and 10.5 billion, respectively. accumulated amortization of equipment and property under capital leases at september 30, 2008 and december 31, 2007 was 573 million and 1.2 billion, respectively. during the second quarter of 2008, the company recorded an impairment charge to write down its mcdonnell douglas md80 fleet and certain related long lived assets to their estimated fair values. as a result 2.7 billion of accumulated depreciation and amortization was eliminated as a new cost basis was established for these aircraft. see note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the impairment charges. 5. as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2007 form 10 k, the company has a valuation allowance against the full amount of its net deferred tax asset. the company currently provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized. the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased approximately 845 million during the nine months ended september 30, 2008 to 2.0 billion as of september 30, 2008, including the impact of comprehensive loss for the nine months ended september 30, 2008 and changes from other adjustments. 6. as of september 30, 2008, american had issued guarantees covering approximately 750 million of amr s unsecured debt. in addition, as of september 30, 2008, amr and american had issued guarantees covering approximately 305 million of amr eagle s secured debt. american has a secured bank credit facility which consists of a fully drawn 255 million revolving credit facility fully drawn in september 2008 , with a final maturity on june 17, 2009, and a fully drawn 437 million term loan facility, with a final maturity on december 17, 2010 the revolving facility and the term loan facility, respectively, and collectively, the credit facility . the credit facility contains a covenant the ebitdar covenant requiring amr to maintain specified ratios of cash flow to fixed charges. in may 2008, amr and american entered into an amendment to the credit facility which waived compliance with the ebitdar covenant for periods ending on any date from and including june 30, 2008 through march 31, 2009, and which reduced the minimum ratios amr is required to satisfy thereafter. the required ratio will be 0.90 to 1.00 for the one quarter period ending june 30, 2009 and will increase to 1.15 to 1.00 for the four quarter period ending september 30, 2010. in may 2008, the financial accounting standards board fasb affirmed the consensus of fasb staff position apb 14 1 fsp apb 14 1 , accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement , which applies to all convertible debt instruments that have a net settlement feature , which means that such convertible debt instruments, by their terms, may be settled either wholly or partially in cash upon conversion. fsp apb 14 1 requires issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner reflective of the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. fsp apb 14 1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is not permitted and retroactive application to all periods presented is required. the company does not expect the adoption of apb 14 1 will have any impact on its consolidated financial statements. american airlines, inc. notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited in the third quarter, the company raised approximately 500 million under a loan secured by aircraft. the loan bears interest at a libor based london interbank offered rate variable rate with a fixed margin which resets quarterly and is due in installments through 2015. 7. in september 2006, the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no. 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 . sfas 157 introduces a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities. sfas 157 for financial assets and liabilities is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2007, and the company has adopted the standard for those assets and liabilities as of january 1, 2008 and the impact of adoption was not significant. sfas 157 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. sfas 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 2 observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. the company s short term investments primarily utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities. the company s fuel derivative contracts, which primarily consist of commodity options and collars, are valued using energy and commodity market data which is derived by combining raw inputs with quantitative models and processes to generate forward curves and volatilities. level 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. the company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below in millions fair value measurements as of september 30, 2008 description total level 1 level 2 level 3 short term investments 1 4,344 1,196 3,148 restricted cash and short term investments 1 456 456 fuel derivative contracts 1, 2 165 165 total 4,965 1,652 3,313 1 unrealized gains or losses on short term investments, restricted cash and short term investments and derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss at each measurement date. 2 fuel derivative contracts are recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. as of september 30, 2008, contracts in an asset position were 210 million and were recorded in fuel derivative contracts, while contracts in a liability position were 45 million and were recorded in accrued liabilities. american airlines, inc. notes to condensed consolidated

plan is 78 million. on july 15, 2008 the company made a contribution of 3 million bringing year to date contributions to the minimum contribution amount of 78 million. in october 2008, the company incurred a settlement for one of its defined benefit plans under the application of statement of financial accounting standard no. 88 employers' accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits sfas 88 and additional settlements may occur in the fourth quarter, dependent upon plan redemptions. as a result, the company will recognize, in the fourth quarter of 2008, a pro rata portion of the unrealized losses associated with this plan. the amount of the non cash charge to be recognized is not yet determinable. 9. as a result of the revenue environment, high fuel prices and the company s restructuring activities, the company has recorded a number of charges during the last few years. in may 2008, the company announced capacity reductions due to unprecedented high fuel costs and the other challenges facing the industry. in connection with these capacity reductions, the company incurred special charges related to aircraft, employee reductions and certain other charges. american airlines, inc. notes to condensed consolidated financial statements continued unaudited aircraft charges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no. 144, accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 144 , the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. in connection with the may 2008 capacity reduction announcement, the company concluded that a triggering event had occurred and required a test for impairment. as a result of this test, the company concluded the carrying value of its mcdonnell douglas md 80 fleet was no longer recoverable. consequently, during the second quarter of 2008, the company recorded an impairment charge of 1.0 billion to write down the mcdonnell douglas md 80 fleet and certain related long lived assets to their estimated fair values. no portion of these impairment charges will result in future cash expenditures. all other fleet types were tested for impairment but were concluded to be recoverable with projected undiscounted cash flows or had fair values at levels above current carrying value. the mcdonnell douglas md 80 aircraft are being depreciated over their remaining useful lives averaging approximately five years. amr eagle also concluded that the carrying value of its embraer rj 135 fleet was also no longer recoverable. based on the terms of the capacity purchase agreement with amr eagle, american paid amr eagle during the second quarter of 2008 for their 115 million impairment charge related to the embraer rj 135 fleet which was recorded as a component of special charges. in determining the asset recoverability, management estimated the undiscounted future cash flows utilizing models used by the company in making fleet and scheduling decisions. in determining fair market value, the company utilized recent external appraisals of its fleets, a published aircraft pricing survey and recent transactions involving sales of similar aircraft, adjusted based on estimates of maintenance status and to consider the impact of recent industry events on these values. as a result of the write down of these aircraft to fair value, as well as the acceleration of the retirement dates, depreciation expense is expected to decrease by approximately 141 million on an annualized basis. as part of these capacity reductions, the company expects to ground over the next twelve months its leased airbus a300 aircraft prior to lease expiration. as of september 30, 2008, the company estimates that it will incur approximately 140 million in net present value of future lease payments and lease return costs related to the grounding of the leased a300 fleet, of which 19 million was incurred in the third quarter of 2008 as two aircraft were removed from service. the remaining charges will be incurred over the next four quarters as the aircraft are removed from service. these expected future charges do not yet consider potential sublease contracts or similar arrangements with respect to the leased airbus 300 aircraft, which could offset a portion of the charges, as significant contract amendments are required in order to execute any sublease agreements. the company estimates that virtually all of these charges will result in future cash expenditures. employee charges in conjunction with the capacity reductions announced in may 2008, the company estimated that it will reduce its workforce commensurate with the announced system wide capacity reductions. this reduction in workforce is being accomplished through various measures, including voluntary programs, part time work schedules, furloughs in accordance with collective bargaining agreements, and other reductions. as a result of this reduction in workforce the company will incur employee charges of approximately 70 million for severance related costs, of which an aggregate 61 million had been recorded as of september 30, 2008 in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no. 112, employers accounting for postemployment benefits sfas 112 , based on probable expectations of involuntary terminations. the company does not expect remaining charges related to the reduction in workforce to be significant. american airlines, inc. notes to condensed consolidated financial statements continued unaudited the following table summarizes the components of the company s special charges, the remaining accruals

cash outlays related to the accruals for aircraft charges and facility exit costs will occur through 2017 and 2018, respectively. cash outlays for the employee charges will be incurred over the next several quarters. other during the quarter ended september 30, 2008, the company finalized the liability associated with flight 587. a previously recorded liability and related insurance receivable were reduced as a result of the settlement by approximately 381 million. 10. the company includes changes in the fair value of certain derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities in comprehensive income. for the three month periods ended september 30, 2008 and 2007, comprehensive income loss was 1.5 billion and 156 million, respectively, and for the nine month periods ended september 30, 2008 and 2007, comprehensive income loss was 2.5 billion and 550 million, respectively. total comprehensive income for the year ended december 31, 2007 was 2.3 billion. the difference between net earnings loss and comprehensive income loss for the three and nine month periods ended september 30, 2008 and 2007 is due primarily to the accounting for the company s derivative financial instruments. due to the current value of the company s derivative contracts, some agreements with counterparties require collateral to be deposited with the company. as of september 30, 2008 the collateral held in short term investments by amr from such counterparties was 239 million, an increase of 75 million from december 31, 2007, which is included in cash flows from operations. ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in crude oil or other crude oil related commodities. as required by statement of financial accounting standard no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 , the company assesses, both at the inception of each hedge and on an on going basis, whether the derivatives that are used in its hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. in doing so, the company uses a regression model to determine the correlation of the change in prices of the commodities used to hedge jet fuel nymex heating oil to the change in the price of jet fuel. the company also monitors the actual dollar offset of the hedges market values as compared to hypothetical jet fuel hedges. the fuel hedge contracts are generally deemed to be highly effective if the r squared is greater than 80 percent and the dollar offset correlation is within 80 percent to 125 percent. the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively if it determines that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective as a hedge or if it decides to discontinue the hedging relationship. american airlines, inc. notes to condensed consolidated financial statements continued unaudited in march of 2008, the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no. 161, disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities, an amendment of fasb statement no. 133 sfas 161 . sfas 161 requires entities to provide greater transparency about how and why the entity uses derivative instruments, how the instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas 133, and how the instruments and related hedged items affect the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the entity. sfas 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2008. the principal impact to the company will be to require the company to expand its disclosure regarding its derivative instruments. in september 2008, a counterparty to certain of the company s fuel hedging derivative contracts filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. per the contract, the company was able to terminate its hedge positions with this counterparty as a result of the counterparty s default. due to the decline in fuel prices subsequent to the chapter 11 filing, the company was in a liability position to this counterparty at the time the hedge position was terminated. the company incurred a charge of 23 million associated with these contracts during the period subsequent to the chapter 11 filing and prior to termination, when the derivative contracts no longer qualified for hedge accounting under sfas 133. the charge was recorded to miscellaneous net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations. had the company retained these hedge positions, this charge would have been incurred as fuel expense over the next two years assuming a static fuel price from the termination date. item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information statements in this report contain various forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, which represent the company's expectations or beliefs concerning future events. when used in this document and in documents incorporated herein by reference, the words expects, plans, anticipates, indicates, believes, forecast, guidance, outlook, may, will, should, seeks , targets and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. similarly, statements that describe the company s objectives, plans or goals are forward looking statements. forward looking statements include, without limitation, the company s expectations concerning operations and financial conditions, including changes in capacity, revenues, and costs, future financing plans and needs, fleet plans, overall economic conditions, plans and objectives for future operations, and the impact on the company of its results of operations in recent years and the sufficiency of its financial resources to absorb that impact. other forward looking statements include statements which do not relate solely to historical facts, such as, without limitation, statements which discuss the possible future effects of current known trends or uncertainties, or which indicate that the future effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed or assured. all forward looking statements in this report are based upon information available to the company on the date of this report. the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. forward looking statements are subject to a number of factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations. the following factors, in addition to other possible factors not listed, could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements the materially weakened financial condition of the company, resulting from its significant losses in recent years the ability of the company to generate additional revenues and reduce its costs changes in economic and other conditions beyond the company s control, and the volatile results of the company s operations the company s substantial indebtedness and other obligations the ability of the company to satisfy existing financial or other covenants in certain of its credit agreements continued high and volatile fuel prices and further increases in the price of fuel, and the availability of fuel the fiercely and increasingly competitive business environment faced by the company industry consolidation competition with reorganized carriers low fare levels by historical standards and the company s reduced pricing power the company s need to raise substantial additional funds and its ability to do so on acceptable terms changes in the company s corporate or business strategy government regulation of the company s business conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks uncertainties with respect to the company s international operations outbreaks of a disease such as sars or avian flu that affects travel behavior labor costs that are higher than those of the company s competitors uncertainties with respect to the company s relationships with unionized and other employee work groups increased insurance costs and potential reductions of available insurance coverage the company s ability to retain key management personnel potential failures or disruptions of the company s computer, communications or other technology systems changes in the price of the company s common stock and the ability of the company to reach acceptable agreements with third parties. additional information concerning these and other factors is contained in the company s securities and exchange commission filings, including but not limited to the company s 2007 form 10 k see in particular item 1a risk factors in the 2007 form 10 k, and as amended in item 1a in this quarterly report on form 10 q for the quarter ended september 30, 2008 . overview the company recorded net loss of 396 million in the third quarter of 2008 compared to net earnings of 146 million in the same period last year. the company s third quarter 2008 results includes 25 million of special charges due to continued capacity reduction effects. the capacity reduction charges are described in footnote 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. excluding these special items, the company s third quarter 2008 net operating loss reflects a dramatic year over year increase in fuel prices from an average of 2.17 per gallon in the third quarter 2007 to an average of 3.57 per gallon in the third quarter of 2008. fuel expense has become the company s largest single expense category and the price increase resulted in 967 million in incremental year over year fuel expense in the third quarter 2008 based on the year over year increase in the average price per gallon multiplied by gallons consumed . although fuel prices have abated somewhat from the record prices recorded in july 2008, fuel prices are still very high and volatile by historical standards. the significant rise in fuel price was partially offset by higher unit revenues passenger revenue per available seat mile . passenger unit revenues increased 10.9 percent for the third quarter due to a 13.2 percent increase in passenger yield passenger revenue per passenger mile partially offset by a 1.7 point load factor decrease compared to the same period in 2007. although passenger yield showed year over year improvement, passenger yield remains essentially flat with the levels set in 2000 despite cumulative inflation of approximately 27 over the same time frame. the company made several announcements during the third quarter. in august 2008, american entered into a joint business agreement and related marketing arrangements with uk carrier, british airways, and spanish carrier, iberia providing for commercial cooperation by the three carriers on flights between north america consisting of the united states, canada and mexico and europe consisting of the european union, switzerland and norway . the agreement contemplates the pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs on transatlantic flights, expanded codesharing on each other s flights, enhanced frequent flyer program reciprocity, and cooperation in the areas of planning, marketing and certain operations. these agreements were signed in connection with an application to the u.s. department of transportation by the three carriers for antitrust immunity to permit global cooperation. the application also included the finnish carrier, finnair, and the jordanian carrier, royal jordanian. if granted which cannot be assured , antitrust immunity will permit the five carriers, all of whom are members of the oneworld airline alliance, to deepen cooperation on a bilateral and multilateral basis. implementation of the joint business agreement and related arrangements is subject to conditions, including various u.s. and foreign regulatory approvals, successful negotiation of certain detailed financial and commercial arrangements, and other approvals. agencies from which regulatory approvals must be obtained may impose requirements or limitations as a condition of granting such approvals, such as requiring divestiture of routes, gates, slots or other assets. during the quarter ended september 30, 2008, the company entered into amendments to its 737 800 purchase agreement with the boeing company. giving effect to the amendments, the company is now committed to take delivery of a total of 36 737 800 aircraft in 2009 and 40 737 800 aircraft in 2010. in addition to these aircraft, the company has firm commitments for eleven 737 800 aircraft and seven boeing 777 aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2013 2016. on october 15, 2008, the company entered into a new purchase agreement with boeing for the acquisition of 42 boeing 787 9 aircraft scheduled to be delivered between 2012 and 2018. the boeing 787 9 purchase agreement contains certain contingency provisions, which are described in the liquidity and capital resources subsection of item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. the agreement also includes purchase rights to acquire up to 58 additional boeing 787 aircraft, with deliveries between 2015 and 2020. the company s ability to become consistently profitable and its ability to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis will depend on a number of factors, many of which are largely beyond the company s control. certain risk factors that affect the company s business and financial results are referred to under forward looking information above and are discussed in the risk factors listed in item 1a on pages 11 17 in the 2007 form 10 k, and as amended in item 1a in this quarterly report on form 10 q for the quarter ended september 30, 2008. in addition, four of the company s largest domestic competitors and several smaller carriers have filed for bankruptcy in the last several years and have used this process to significantly reduce contractual labor and other costs. in order to remain competitive and to improve its financial condition, the company must continue to take steps to generate additional revenues and to reduce its costs. although the company has a number of initiatives underway to address its cost and revenue challenges, the adequacy and ultimate success of these initiatives is not known at this time and cannot be assured. it will be very difficult for the company to continue to fund its obligations on an ongoing basis, and to return to profitability, if the overall industry revenue environment does not improve substantially and if fuel prices were to persist for an extended period at recent historic high levels. liquidity and capital resources significant indebtedness and future financing the company remains heavily indebted and has significant obligations including substantial pension funding obligations , as described more fully under item 7, management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2007 form 10 k. as of the date of this form 10 q, the company believes it should have sufficient liquidity to fund its operations for the near term, including repayment of debt and capital leases, capital expenditures and other contractual obligations. however, to maintain sufficient liquidity as the company continues to implement its restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, and because the company has significant debt, lease and other obligations in the next several years, including commitments to purchase aircraft, as well as significant pension funding obligations, the company will need access to substantial additional funding. the company s possible financing sources primarily include i a limited amount of additional secured aircraft debt a very large majority of the company s owned aircraft, including the company s section 1110 eligible aircraft, are encumbered or sale leaseback transactions involving owned aircraft ii debt secured by new aircraft deliveries iii debt secured by other assets iv securitization of future operating receipts v the sale or monetization of certain assets vi unsecured debt and vii issuance of equity and or equity like securities. besides unencumbered aircraft, some of the company s particular assets and other sources of liquidity that could be sold or otherwise used as sources of financing include aadvantage program miles, route authorities and takeoff and landing slots. the availability and level of the financing sources described above cannot be assured, particularly in light of the company s financial results in recent years, the company s substantial indebtedness, the difficult revenue environment it faces, its reduced credit ratings, historically high fuel prices, and the financial difficulties experienced in the airline industry. in addition, recent disruptions in the credit markets have resulted in greater volatility, less liquidity, widening of credit spreads and more limited availability of financing. the inability of the company to obtain necessary funding on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on the company. the company s substantial indebtedness and other obligations have important consequences. for example, they i limit the company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such financing could be obtained ii require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes iii make the company more vulnerable to economic downturns and iv limit the company s ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. the company has firm commitments to take delivery of a total of 36 737 800 aircraft in 2009 and 40 737 800 aircraft in 2010. in addition to these aircraft, the company has firm commitments for eleven 737 800 aircraft and seven boeing 777 aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2013 2016. under the company s boeing 737 800 and boeing 777 200 purchase agreements, payments for the related aircraft purchase commitments will be zero in the remainder of 2008, approximately 1.2 billion in 2009, 1.1 billion in 2010, 99 million in 2011, 220 million in 2012, and 1.0 billion for 2013 and beyond. these amounts are net of purchase deposits currently held by the manufacturer. in october of 2008, the company entered into a sale leaseback agreement for 20 of the 36 boeing 737 800 aircraft to be delivered in 2009. such financing is subject to certain terms and conditions including a minimum liquidity requirement. in addition, the company had previously arranged for backstop financing which could be used for the remaining 16 of the company s 2009 boeing 737 800 aircraft deliveries, as well as a significant portion of the 2010 boeing 737 800 aircraft deliveries. if the company elects to utilize the backstop financing, all of its purchase commitments for 2009 and 2010 will be covered by committed financing except for approximately 400 million substantially all of which are due in the fourth quarter of 2010. on october 15, 2008, the company entered into a new purchase agreement with boeing for the acquisition of 42 boeing 787 9 aircraft. the first such aircraft is scheduled to be delivered in 2012, and the last is scheduled to be delivered in 2018. the agreement also includes purchase rights to acquire up to 58 additional boeing 787 aircraft, with deliveries between 2015 and 2020. under the 787 9 purchase agreement, except as described below, american will not be obligated to purchase a 787 9 aircraft unless it gives boeing notice confirming its election to do so at least 18 months prior to the scheduled delivery date for that aircraft the first scheduled delivery date is in september 2012 . if american does not give that notice with respect to an aircraft, the aircraft will be no longer subject to the 787 9 purchase agreement. these confirmation rights may be exercised until may 1, 2013, provided that those rights will terminate earlier if american reaches a collective bargaining agreement with its pilot union that includes provisions enabling american to utilize the 787 9 to american s satisfaction in the operations desired by american, or if american confirms its election to purchase any of the initial 42 787 9 aircraft. while there can be no assurances, american expects to have reached an agreement as described above with its pilots union prior to the first notification date. in either of those events, american would become obligated to purchase all of the initial 42 aircraft then subject to the purchase agreement. if neither of those events occur prior to may 1, 2013, then on that date american may elect to purchase all of the initial 42 aircraft then subject to the purchase agreement, and if it does not elect to do so, the purchase agreement will terminate in its entirety. the company s continued aircraft replacement strategy, and its execution of that strategy, will depend on such factors as future economic and industry conditions and the financial condition of the company. credit facility covenants american s credit facility, consists of a fully drawn 255 million revolving credit facility, with a final maturity on june 17, 2009, and a fully drawn 437 million term loan facility, with a final maturity on december 17, 2010. in order to mitigate the impact of a potential credit card processing reserve, the company drew down its 255 million revolving credit facility in september 2008. american s obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by amr. the credit facility contains a covenant the liquidity covenant requiring american to maintain, as defined, unrestricted cash, unencumbered short term investments and amounts available for drawing under committed revolving credit facilities of not less than 1.25 billion for each quarterly period through the life of the credit facility. amr and american were in compliance with the liquidity covenant as of september 30, 2008 and expect to be able to continue to comply with this covenant. in addition, the credit facility contains a covenant the ebitdar covenant requiring amr to maintain a ratio of cash flow defined as consolidated net income, before interest expense less capitalized interest , income taxes, depreciation and amortization and rentals, adjusted for certain gains or losses and non cash items to fixed charges comprising interest expense less capitalized interest and rentals . in may 2008, amr and american entered into an amendment to the credit facility which waived compliance with the ebitdar covenant for periods ending on any date from and including june 30, 2008 through march 31, 2009, and which reduced the minimum ratios amr is required to satisfy thereafter. the required ratio will be 0.90 to 1.00 for the one quarter period ending june 30, 2009 and will increase to 1.15 to 1.00 for the four quarter period ending september 30, 2010. given fuel prices that are very high by historical standards and the volatility of fuel prices and revenues, it is difficult to assess whether the company will be able to continue to comply with these covenants, and there are no assurances that the company will be able to do so. failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under the credit facility which if the company did not take steps to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate, the default could result in a default under a significant amount of other debt and lease obligations, and otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company. credit card processing and other reserves american has agreements with a number of credit card companies and processors to accept credit cards for the sale of air travel and other services. under certain of american s current credit card processing agreements, the related credit card company or processor may hold back, under certain circumstances, a reserve from american s credit card receivables. american is not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements. under one such agreement, the amount of such reserve may be based on, among other things, the amount of unrestricted cash not including undrawn credit facilities held by american and american s debt service coverage ratio, as defined in the agreement. in order to mitigate the impact of this potential reserve, the company drew down its 255 million revolving credit facility in september 2008. american expects that if fuel prices remain high by historical standards and are not adequately offset by fare increases, american could be required to maintain a reserve under this agreement in future years. based on the company s current agreement, no reserves will be required in 2008. given the volatility of fuel prices and revenues, it is difficult to forecast the required amount of such reserve at any time. however, if current conditions persist for some time, such required amount could be significant in 2009. pension funding obligation the company s 2008 minimum required contribution to its defined benefit pension plan is 78 million. on july 15, the company made an additional contribution of 3 million bringing year to date contributions to the minimum contribution of 78 million. cash flow activity at september 30, 2008, the company had 4.6 billion in unrestricted cash and short term investments, compared with 4.4 billion as of december 31, 2007. the company s unrestricted cash and short term investments included 239 million and 164 million, respectively, in collateral deposits received from the counterparties of the company s fuel derivative instruments. the amount of collateral required to be deposited with the company or with the counterparty by the company is based on fuel price in relation to the market values of the derivative contracts and collateral provisions per the terms of those contracts and can fluctuate significantly. net cash provided by used for operating activities in the nine month period ended september 30, 2008 was 163 million, a decrease of 1.8 billion over the same period in 2007 primarily due to a dramatic year over year increase in average fuel prices from 2.03 per gallon for the nine months ending september 30, 2007 to 3.16 per gallon for the same period in 2008. the fuel price increase resulted in 2.3 billion in incremental year over year expense in the third quarter 2008 based on the year over year increase in the average price per gallon multiplied by gallons consumed . the company contributed 78 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the first nine months of 2008 compared to 380 million during the first nine months of 2007. in the quarter ended september 30, 2008, american raised approximately 500 million under a loan secured by aircraft, due in installments through 2015. in september 2008, the company drew down its 255 million revolving credit facility. the draw on the credit facility was intended to reduce the amount of a potential credit card hold back reserve that could have been imposed in the fourth quarter of 2008 based on the terms of one of the company s credit card processing agreements. the amount of the hold back reserve from such agreement may be based on, among other things, the amount of unrestricted cash which does not include undrawn credit facilities held by the company and the company s debt service coverage ratio. capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2008 were 670 million and primarily included aircraft purchase deposits and aircraft modifications. in the past, the company has from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased its debt and taken other steps to reduce its debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve its balance sheet. going forward, depending on market conditions, its cash positions and other considerations, the company may continue to take such actions. results of operations for the nine months ended september 30, 2008 and 2007 revenues the company s revenues increased approximately 1.1 billion, or 6.1 percent, to 18.2 billion for the nine months ended september 30, 2008 from the same period last year. american s passenger revenues increased by 5.7 percent, or 761 million, while capacity asm decreased by 2.3 percent. american s passenger load factor remained effectively static at 81.3 percent and passenger revenue yield per passenger mile increased by 9.0 percent to 13.87 cents. this resulted in an increase in american s passenger rasm of 8.2 percent to 11.27 cents. following is additional information regarding american s domestic and

industry standard proration agreements for flights connecting to american flights, increased 68 million, or 3.6 percent, to 1.9 billion as a result of increased passenger yield. regional affiliates traffic decreased 8.5 percent to 6.8 billion revenue passenger miles rpms , while capacity decreased 4.1 percent to 9.7 billion asms, resulting in a 3.4 point decrease in the passenger load factor to 70.6 percent. in the first quarter of 2008, the company began classifying certain mileage sales revenue to other revenue, which was previously recognized as a component of passenger revenue. see note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. the company continues to pursue ancillary revenue opportunities through miscellaneous fee increases and the implementation of new fees for certain services. for the nine months ending september 30, 2008, these revenues increased 10.0 percent, or 142 million versus the same period in 2007. operating expenses the company s total operating expenses increased 22.9 percent, or 3.7 billion, to 20.0 billion for the nine months ended september 30, 2008 compared to the same period of 2007. the company s operating expenses per asm increased 26.6 percent to 14.15 cents compared to the same period in 2007. these increases are partially due to a non cash impairment charge of 1.0 billion to write the mcdonnell douglas md 80 fleet and certain related long lived assets down to their estimated fair values. this impairment charge was triggered by the record increase in fuel prices over the last twelve months. in addition, the company accrued 61 million for severance costs related to the capacity reductions and 19 million related to the grounding of leased airbus a300 aircraft prior to lease expiration. these special items represented 9.52 cents of the increase in operating expenses per asm for the nine months ended september 30, 2008. the remaining increase in operating expense was primarily due to a dramatic year over year increase in fuel prices from 2.03 per gallon in the nine months ending september 30, 2007 to 3.16 per gallon for the same period in 2008. fuel expense is the company s largest single expense category and the price increase resulted in 2.3 billion in incremental year over year fuel expense for the nine months ended september 30, 2008 based on the year over year increase in the average price per gallon multiplied by gallons consumed . continuing high fuel prices, additional increases in the price of fuel and or disruptions in the supply of fuel would further materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations. in millions operating expenses nine months ended september 30, 2008 change from 2007 percentage change aircraft

the impact of fuel hedging offset by a 3.4 percent decrease in the company s fuel consumption, primarily due to reductions in available seat miles. b maintenance, materials and repairs expense increased due to a heavier workscope of scheduled airframe maintenance overhauls, repair costs and volume, and contractual engine repair rates, which are driven by aircraft age. c special charges are related to a non cash impairment charge of 1.0 billion to write the mcdonnell douglas md 80 fleet and certain related long lived assets down to their estimated fair values. this impairment charge was triggered by the record increase in fuel prices over the last twelve months. in addition, the company accrued 61 million for severance costs and 19 million related to the grounding of leased airbus a300 aircraft prior to lease expiration related to the capacity reductions. other income expense interest income decreased 114 million in nine months ended september 30, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 due primarily to decrease in interest rates. interest expense decreased 122 million as a result of a decrease in the company s long term debt balance. income tax the company did not record a net tax provision benefit associated with its loss for the nine months ended september 30, 2008 or its earnings for the nine months ended september 30, 2007 due to the company providing a valuation allowance, as discussed in note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. regional affiliates the following table summarizes the combined capacity purchase activity for the

2007, with domestic mainline jet capacity expected to decline by 12.5 percent and international capacity to decrease 0.6 percent year over year. the company expects mainline capacity to decline approximately 3.7 percent for the full year 2008 compared to 2007, with a 6.2 percent reduction in domestic capacity and a 0.6 percent decrease in international capacity. the company s capacity is expected to decline approximately 5.5 percent compared to 2008 levels, with domestic capacity expected to decrease by 8.5 percent in 2009 compared to 2008. international capacity is expected to decline by approximately 1 in 2009 versus 2008. the company currently expects fourth quarter 2008 unit costs to increase approximately 8.6 percent year over year. the fourth quarter 2008 unit cost expectations reflect cost pressures associated with the company s previously announced capacity reductions. full year 2008 unit costs are expected to increase approximately 22.0 percent year over year, primarily due to the increase in the price of fuel. the company s results are significantly affected by the price of jet fuel, which is in turn affected by a number of factors beyond the company s control. although fuel prices have abated somewhat from the record prices recorded in july 2008, fuel prices are still very high and volatile by historical standards.
