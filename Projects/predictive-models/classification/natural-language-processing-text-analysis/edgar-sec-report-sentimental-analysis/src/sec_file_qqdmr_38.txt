financial condition. overview income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2004 was 281 million and net income was 288 million. the corporation s refining and marketing business posted quarterly earnings of 160 million. these results benefited from the operations of the hovensa joint venture refinery, which ran near full capacity during the quarter and experienced strong refining margins. exploration and production operations generated income of 182 million for the second quarter of 2004. worldwide oil and gas production averaged 349,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the first half of the year. as a result of this production performance, the corporation anticipates that full year 2004 production will average 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase from the previous estimate of 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. however, in the third quarter, production will be lower than in the first half of the year, primarily as a result of normal north sea facilities maintenance. in the deepwater gulf of mexico, the llano field, in which the corporation has a 50 interest, commenced production on april 30. net production is currently in excess of 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. on block a 18 in the malaysia thailand joint development area, the installation of the offshore pipeline was completed during the second quarter and construction of the onshore portion of the pipeline is on schedule to be completed by early 2005. it is estimated that first gas production will occur during the first half of 2005. in equatorial guinea, the corporation submitted the plan of development for the northern block g fields to the government on june 7. in august 2004, the corporation announced that the plan of development was approved by the government of equatorial guinea. first production is expected to occur by the first quarter of 2007. results of operations net income for the second quarter of 2004 amounted to 288 million, compared with 252 million in the second quarter of 2003. income from discontinued operations was 7 million in the second quarter of 2004 and 189 million in the second quarter of 2003. net income for the first half of 2004 was 569 million compared with 428 million in the first half of 2003, including 7 million and 169 million from discontinued operations, respectively. the after tax

of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its analysis of variances in segment earnings. management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. after tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. exploration and production exploration and production earnings from continuing operations increased by 94 million in the second quarter and 182 million in the first half of 2004 compared with the corresponding periods of 2003. earnings include an after tax gain of 15 million 3

sales of 33 million 23 million before income taxes and 31 million 47 million before income taxes , respectively. earnings also include after tax charges of 6 million and 23 million in the second quarters of 2004 and 2003 10 million and 38 million before income taxes , respectively, for accrued severance and a reduction in leased office space in london. 12 table of contents part i financial information cont d. results of operations continued after considering the gains on asset sales and other items described above, the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, sales volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses, as discussed below. selling prices higher average selling prices of crude oil and natural gas increased exploration and production revenues by approximately 100 million in the second quarter and 190 million in the first six months of 2004 compared with the same periods of 2003. the

equivalent basis, decreased to 349,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2004 from 398,000 barrels per day in 2003. this decline was primarily due to asset sales and exchanges in 2003 and natural
