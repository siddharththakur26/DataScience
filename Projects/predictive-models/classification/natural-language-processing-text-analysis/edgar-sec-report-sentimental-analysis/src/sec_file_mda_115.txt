item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the three months ended march 31, 2003 and 2002 summary amr corporation's amr or the company net loss during the first quarter of 2003 was 1.0 billion, or 6.68 per share, as compared to a net loss of 1.6 billion, or 10.09 per share for the same period in 2002. the company's first quarter 2002 results include a one time, non cash charge to record the cumulative effect of a change in accounting, effective january 1, 2002, of 988 million, or 6.38 per share, to write off all of amr's goodwill upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards board no. 142 goodwill and other intangible assets see note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements . amr's operating loss of 869 million increased 140 million compared to the same period in 2002. amr's principal subsidiary is american airlines, inc. american . the company's first quarter 2003 revenues continued to decrease year over year. the company's revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown, seen largely in business travel declines and changes in business traveler profiles the geographic distribution of the company's network and reduced fares due in large part to increased competition from low cost carriers. the company's first quarter 2003 revenues were also negatively impacted by the war in iraq and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars . the company's revenues decreased approximately 43 million, or 1.0 percent, to 4.1 billion in the first quarter of 2003 from the same period last year. american's passenger revenues decreased by 2.6 percent, or 90 million, in the first three months of 2003 from the same period in 2002. american's domestic revenue per available seat mile rasm decreased 3.2 percent, to 8.43 cents, on a capacity increase of 1.8 percent, to 28.8 billion available seat miles asms . international rasm decreased to 8.43 cents, or 2.7 percent, on a capacity increase of 6.5 percent. the decrease in international rasm was due to a 26.4 percent decrease in pacific rasm slightly offset by a 1.0 percent increase in european rasm. latin american rasm remained flat. the increase in international capacity was driven by a 52.4 percent and 9.8 percent increase in pacific and european asms, respectively, slightly offset by a 1.5 percent reduction in latin american asms. the company's regional affiliates include two wholly owned subsidiaries, american eagle airlines, inc. american eagle and executive airlines, inc. executive collectively, amr eagle , and two independent carriers, trans states airlines, inc. trans states and chautauqua airlines, inc. chautauqua . in 2002, american had a fixed fee per block hour agreement with chautauqua, and prorate agreements with amr eagle and trans states. in 2003, american had fixed fee per block hour agreements with all three carriers. the net effect of the change in the form of the agreements was flat revenue. regional affiliates' traffic increased 14.0 percent while capacity increased 15.0 percent, to approximately 2.0 billion asms. certain amounts from 2002 related to regional affiliates have been reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation. other revenues increased 21.5 percent, or 47 million, due primarily to increases in ticket change fees coupled with changes to the company's change fee arrangements with travel agencies, increases in airfreight service fees due primarily to fuel surcharges and increases in aadvantage fees. the company's operating expenses increased 2.0 percent, or 97 million. wages, salaries and benefits increased 2.1 percent, or 43 million, primarily due to increases in pension and health insurance costs and contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the company's labor contracts, offset by a reduction in the average number of employees. aircraft fuel expense increased 38.3 percent, or 202 million, due primarily to a 39.9 percent increase in american's average price per gallon of fuel. commissions, booking fees and credit card expense decreased 20.3 percent, or 65 million, due primarily to commission structure changes implemented in march 2002 and a 2.4 percent decrease in passenger revenues. maintenance, materials and repairs decreased 13.2 percent, or 35 million, due primarily to a decrease in airframe and engine volumes at the company's maintenance bases resulting from a variety of factors including the retirement of aircraft, the timing of engines returning from repair vendors and a decrease in the number of flights and the receipt of certain vendor credits. aircraft rentals decreased 36 million, or 15.9 percent, due primarily to lease expirations and the removal of leased aircraft from service in prior periods. food service decreased 12.4 percent, or 21 million, due primarily to reductions in the level of food service. 12 15 other income expense , historically a net expense, increased 40 million due to the following interest income decreased 27.8 percent, or 5 million, due primarily to decreasing short term investment balances. interest expense increased 26 million, or 15.7 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in the company's long term debt. miscellaneous net increased 75.0 percent, or 6 million, due to the write down of certain investments held by the company during the first quarter of 2003. the company has experienced significant cumulative losses and as a result generated certain net operating losses available to offset future taxes payable. as a result of the cumulative operating losses, a valuation allowance was established against the full amount of the company's net deferred tax asset as of december 31, 2002. the company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. during the first quarter of 2003 the company continued to record a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which results in no tax benefit being recorded for the pretax losses. the company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased 383 million in the first quarter of 2003, to 753 million as of march 31, 2003. the effective tax rate for the three months ended march 31, 2002 was impacted by a 27 million charge resulting from a provision in congress' economic stimulus package that changed the period for carrybacks of net operating losses nols . this change allowed the company to carry back 2001 and 2002 nols for five years, rather than two years under the previous law, allowing the company to more quickly recover its nols. the extended nol carryback did however result in the displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years. these credits are now expected to expire before being utilized by the company, resulting in this charge. operating statistics three months

in permanent, annual savings through a combination of changes in wages, benefits and work rules. the requested 1.8 billion in savings was divided by work group as follows 660 million pilots 620 million transportation workers union represented employees 340 million flight attendants 100 million management and support staff and 80 million agents and representatives. references in this document to american's three major unions include the allied pilots association the apa the transportation workers union the twu and the association of professional flight attendants the apfa . on march 31, 2003, american announced that it had reached agreements with its three major unions the labor agreements . it also reported various changes in the pay plans and benefits for non unionized personnel including officers and other management the management reductions . the anticipated cost savings arising from the labor agreements and the management reductions met the targeted annual savings of 1.8 billion. on april 16, 2003, the company reported that the members of american's three major unions had ratified the labor agreements. thereafter, published reports of actions the company had taken in 2002 to retain key executives led two of the unions to indicate that they would not certify the ratification process and might initiate another vote on the labor agreements. the company's actions included i the funding of supplemental pension benefits for the officers of american by means of a secular trust the supplemental pension benefits provide benefits the officers would have received under the terms and conditions of american's defined benefit plans, but for limitations imposed by erisa and ii the execution of retention agreements whereby american would make cash payments to certain officers in january 2004 and january 2005. given the economic turmoil affecting the company and the industry, in 2002 the compensation committee of the amr board of directors decided that it was necessary to offer certain key officers retention agreements to ensure that the officers remained in the employ of the company for two years. in light of the controversy surrounding the retention agreements, they were voluntarily cancelled in april 2003. 14 17 on april 25, 2003, american announced that it had reached agreement with the leaders of its three major unions on modifications to the labor agreements the modified labor agreements . the principal modifications were a shorter duration and the ability to initiate the process of re negotiating the modified labor agreements after three years. even with these modifications, the modified labor agreements continue to meet the targeted annual savings. on april 24, 2003, the company announced that its board of directors had accepted the resignation of donald j. carty chairman and ceo of the company and american . the company also announced that edward a. brennan a director of the company since 1987 had been named chairman of the company and that gerard j. arpey president and coo of the company and american had been named ceo and a director. on april 24, 2003 and april 25, 2003, the three major unions certified the ratification of the modified labor agreements. of the approximately 1.8 billion in savings, approximately 1.0 billion relate to wage and benefit reductions while the remaining approximately .8 billion will be accomplished through changes in work rules which will result in additional job reductions. the company expects to incur severance and benefits related charges in connection with these job reductions beginning in the second quarter of 2003. the amount of such charges could not be reasonably estimated at the time of the filing of this form 10 q. wage reductions became effective on april 1, 2003 for officers and may 1, 2003 for all other employees. reductions related to benefits and work rule changes will be phased in over time. the company expects total savings from wages, benefits and work rule changes to be approximately 200 million in the second quarter of 2003, 400 million in the third quarter of 2003 and 450 million 1.8 billion annually in the fourth quarter of 2003. in connection with the changes in wages, benefits and work rules, the modified labor agreements provide for the issuance of approximately 38 million shares of amr stock in the form of stock options which will generally vest over a three year period see note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information . in addition, subsequent to the ratification of the modified labor agreements, the company and american have reached concessionary agreements with certain vendors, lessors, lenders and suppliers the vendors, and with the agreements the vendor agreements . generally, under the terms of these vendor agreements the company or american will receive the benefit of lower rates and charges for certain goods and services, and more favorable rent and financing terms with respect to certain of its aircraft. in return for these concessions the company anticipates that it will issue over time up to 3.0 million shares of amr's common stock to vendors who have reached agreements with the company. the annual cost savings from the vendors are estimated to be in excess of 175 million. even with the modified labor agreements, the savings from management reductions and the vendor agreements, the company may nonetheless need to initiate a filing under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code a chapter 11 filing because its financial condition will remain weak and its prospects uncertain. among other things, the following factors have had and or may have a negative impact on the company's business and financial results the continued weakness of the u. s. economy the residual effects of the war in iraq the fear of another terrorist attack the sars severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak the inability of the company to satisfy the liquidity requirements or other covenants in certain of its credit arrangements see note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements or the inability of the company to access the capital markets for additional financing. during 2001 and 2002, the company raised approximately 8.3 billion of funding to finance capital commitments and to fund operating losses. the company expects that it will continue to need to raise significant additional financing in the near future to cover its liquidity needs, until such time as i the cost initiatives discussed in the previous paragraphs become fully effective and ii the company returns to profitability. the company had approximately 1.3 billion in unrestricted cash and short term investments as of march 31, 2003. the company also had available possible future financing sources, including, but not limited to i a limited amount of additional secured aircraft debt, ii sale leaseback transactions of owned property, including aircraft and real estate, iii securitization of future operating receipts, and iv the potential sale of certain non core assets including the company's interests in amr investments and worldspan, a computer reservations systems partnership . however, these financing sources may not be available to the company in light of its financial condition. to the extent that the company is unable to access capital markets and raise additional capital, the company will be unable to fund its obligations and sustain its operations. 15 18 in april 2003, the president signed the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act, 2003 the act which includes aviation related assistance provisions. the act authorizes payment of i 100 million to compensate air carriers for the direct costs associated with the strengthening of flight deck doors and locks and ii 2.3 billion to reimburse air carriers for increased security costs which shall be distributed in proportion to amounts each has paid or collected as of the date of enactment in passenger security and air carrier security fees to the transportation security administration. in addition, the act suspends the collection of the passenger security fee from june 1, 2003 until october 1, 2003 and extends war risk insurance through august 30, 2004. the act also limits the total cash compensation for the two most highly compensated named executive officers for certain airlines, including the company, during the period april 1, 2003 to april 1, 2004 to the amount of salary received by such officers in 2002. a violation of this executive compensation provision would require the carrier to repay the government for the amount of its reimbursement for increased security costs as described in item ii above. the company does not anticipate any difficulties in complying with this limitation on executive compensation. the company estimates that its reimbursement under the act, excluding the impact of suspending the security fee from june 1, 2003 until october 1, 2003, will be in the range of 340 million to 360 million. this reimbursement will be recorded as a reduction to operating expenses. the company's compensation for the direct costs associated with strengthening cockpit doors will be recorded as a reduction to capitalized flight equipment. the reimbursement payment from the government is expected in may 2003 the compensation payment is expected sometime this summer. amr and american's credit ratings are significantly below investment grade. in january 2003, standard poor's and moody's placed the credit ratings of amr and american on review for downgrade. in february 2003, moody's further downgraded the senior implied rating for amr, the senior unsecured ratings of both amr and american and the ratings of most of american's secured debt. the moody's ratings remain on review for possible downgrade. also in february 2003, standard poor's lowered its long term corporate credit ratings for both amr and american, lowered the senior secured and unsecured debt ratings of amr, and lowered the secured debt rating of american. american's short term rating was withdrawn. ratings on most of american's non enhanced equipment trust certificates were also lowered. in addition, standard poor's revised the creditwatch implications to developing from negative. in march 2003, standard poor's further lowered its long term corporate credit ratings for both amr and american, lowered the senior secured and unsecured debt ratings of amr, and lowered the secured debt rating of american. ratings on most of american's non enhanced equipment trust certificates were also lowered. these reductions have increased the company's borrowing costs. additional significant reductions in amr's or american's credit ratings would further increase its borrowing or other costs and further restrict the availability of future financing. also in march 2003, standard poor's removed amr's common stock from the s p 500 index. american has a fully drawn 834 million credit facility that expires december 15, 2005. on march 31, 2003, american and certain lenders in such facility entered into a waiver and amendment that i waived, until may 15, 2003, the requirement that american pledge additional collateral to the extent the value of the existing collateral was insufficient under the terms of the facility, ii waived american's liquidity covenant for the quarter ended march 31, 2003, iii modified the financial covenants applicable to subsequent periods, and iv increased the applicable margin for advances under the facility. on may 15, 2003, american expects to pledge an additional 30 non section 1110 eligible aircraft having an aggregate net book value as of march 31, 2003 of approximately 451 million. pursuant to the modified financial covenants, american is required to maintain at least 1.0 billion of liquidity, consisting of unencumbered cash and short term investments, for the second quarter 2003 and beyond. at this point, it is uncertain whether the company will be able to satisfy this liquidity requirement. in addition, the required ratio of ebitdar to fixed charges has been decreased until the period ending december 31, 2004, and the next test of such cash flow coverage ratio will not occur until march 31, 2004. the amendment also provided for a 50 basis points increase in the applicable margin over the london interbank offered rate libor , resulting in an effective interest rate as of march 31, 2003 of 4.73 percent. the interest rate will be reset again on september 17, 2003. at american's option, interest on the facility can be calculated on one of several different bases. for most borrowings, american would anticipate choosing a floating rate based upon libor. 16 19 the company has restricted cash and short term investments related to projected workers' compensation obligations and various other obligations. as of march 31, 2003, projected workers' compensation obligations were secured by restricted cash and short term investments of 386 million and various other obligations were secured by restricted cash and short term investments of 164 million. in the first quarter of 2003, the company redeemed 339 million of tax exempt bonds that were backed by standby letters of credit secured by restricted cash and short term investments resulting in a reduction in restricted cash and short term investments. of the 339 million of tax exempt bonds that were redeemed, 253 million were accounted for as operating leases. payments to redeem these tax exempt special facility revenue bonds are considered prepaid facility rentals and will reduce future operating lease commitments. the remaining 86 million of tax exempt bonds that were redeemed were accounted for as debt and had original maturities in 2014 through 2024. as of march 31, 2003 the company has approximately 251 million in fuel prepayments and credit card holdback deposits classified as other current assets and other assets. net cash used for operating activities in the three month period ended march 31, 2003 was 321 million, a decrease of 126 million over the same period in 2002. included in net cash used for operating activities was the receipt of a 572 million federal tax refund. capital expenditures for the first three months of 2003 were 393 million, and included the acquisition of three boeing 767 300ers, four embraer 140s and two bombardier crj 700 aircraft. these capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and debt agreements. during the three month period ended march 31, 2003, american and amr eagle borrowed approximately 214 million under various debt agreements which are secured by aircraft. effective interest rates on these agreements are fixed or variable based on libor plus a spread and mature over various periods of time through 2019. as of march 31, 2003, the effective interest rate on these agreements ranged up to 8.81 percent. as of march 31, 2003, the company had commitments to acquire the following aircraft two boeing 777 200 ers, six boeing 767 300ers, 18 embraer regional jets and eight bombardier crj 700s in 2003 an aggregate of 74 embraer regional jets and seven bombardier crj 700s in 2004 through 2006 and an aggregate of 47 boeing 737 800s and nine boeing 777 200ers in 2006 through 2010. future payments for all aircraft, including the estimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate 792 million during the remainder of 2003, 753 million in 2004, 694 million in 2005 and an aggregate of approximately 2.6 billion in 2006 through 2010. boeing capital corporation has agreed to provide backstop financing for all boeing aircraft deliveries in 2003. in return, american has granted boeing a security interest in certain advance payments previously made and in certain rights under the aircraft purchase agreement between american and boeing. in addition, the company has pre arranged financing or backstop financing for all of its 2003 embraer and bombardier aircraft deliveries and a portion of its post 2003 deliveries. special facility revenue bonds have been issued by certain municipalities primarily to purchase equipment and improve airport facilities that are leased by american and accounted for as operating leases. approximately 2.1 billion of these bonds with total future payments of approximately 5.7 billion as of march 31, 2003 are guaranteed by american, amr, or both. these guarantees can only be invoked in the event american defaults on the lease obligation and certain other remedies are not available. approximately 740 million of these special facility revenue bonds contain mandatory tender provisions that require american to repurchase the bonds at various times through 2008, including 200 million in november 2003. although american has the right to remarket the bonds there can be no assurance that these bonds will be successfully remarketed. any payments to redeem or purchase bonds that are not remarketed would also be considered prepaid facility rentals and would reduce future operating lease commitments. 17 20 other information in march 2003, the board of directors of amr approved the issuance of additional shares of amr common stock to employees and vendors in connection with ongoing negotiations concerning concessions. the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance was 30 percent of the number of shares of the company's common stock outstanding on march 24, 2003 156,359,955 or approximately 46.9 million shares. from the foregoing authorization, the company expects to issue up to 3.0 million shares to vendors. also in march 2003, the amr board of directors adopted the 2003 employee stock incentive plan 2003 plan to provide equity awards to employees in connection with wage, benefit and work rule concessions. under the 2003 plan, all american employees are eligible to receive stock awards which may include stock options, restricted stock and deferred stock. in april 2003, the company reached final agreements with the unions representing american employees the modified labor agreements, see note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements . in connection with the changes in wages, benefits and work rules, the modified labor agreements provide for the issuance of up to 37.9 million shares of amr stock in the form of stock options. on april 17, 2003 approximately 37.9 million stock options were granted to employees at an exercise price of 5.00 per share, which is equal to the closing price of amr's common stock nyse on that date the grant date . these shares will vest over a three year period and will expire no later than april 17, 2013. these options were granted to members of the apa, the twu, the apfa, agents, other non management personnel and management employees. a provision in the scope clause of american's former contract with the allied pilots associations apa limited the number of available seat miles asms and block hours that could be flown under american's marketing code aa by american's regional carrier partners when american pilots are on furlough the so called asm cap . to ensure that american remained in compliance with the asm cap, american and american eagle took several steps in 2002 to reduce the number of asms flown by american's wholly owned commuter air carriers. as one of those measures, amr eagle signed a letter of intent to sell executive airlines, its san juan based subsidiary. another provision in the former apa contract limited to 67 the total number of regional jets with more than 44 seats that could be flown under the aa code by american's regional carrier partners. as amr eagle continued to accept previously ordered bombardier and embraer regional jets this cap would have been reached in early 2003. to ensure that american remained in compliance with the 67 aircraft cap, amr eagle reached an agreement to dispose of 14 embraer erj 145 aircraft from its fleet. trans states airlines, an americanconnection carrier, agreed to acquire these aircraft. under the former contract between aa and the apa, trans states would have had to operate these aircraft under its ax code, rather than the aa code, at its st. louis hub. the labor agreement with the apa one of the modified labor agreements , ratified in april 2003, modified the provisions in the apa contract described in the immediately preceding two paragraphs to give the company more flexibility with its american eagle operations. the limitations on the use of regional jets were substantially reduced and are now tied to 110 percent of the size of american's narrowbody aircraft fleet. as a consequence of these modifications, it is no longer necessary to use the ax marketing code on flights operated by trans states as the americanconnection, and amr eagle has discontinued its plans to sell executive airlines. 18 21 forward looking information statements in this report contain various forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and
