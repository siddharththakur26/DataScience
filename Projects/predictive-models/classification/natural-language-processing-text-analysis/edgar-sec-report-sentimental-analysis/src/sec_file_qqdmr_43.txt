generally three to five years. the corporation uses the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options. because the exercise prices of employee stock options equal or exceed the market price of the stock on the date of grant, the corporation does not recognize compensation expense. the corporation uses the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options for pro forma disclosure. using the fair value method, stock option expense would be recognized over the one to three year vesting periods. the following pro forma financial information presents the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the corporation used the fair value method in millions, except per share data 8 part i financial information cont d. notes to consolidated financial

2004, the financial accounting standards board issued statement no. 123r, share based payment fas 123r . this standard requires that compensation expense for all stock based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the income statement based on fair values. the corporation must adopt fas 123r no later than january 1, 2006. the corporation is evaluating the requirements of fas 123r and believes that if it adopted the standard in the periods shown above, the impact would not have differed materially from the additional compensation expense disclosed in the above table. 9 part i financial information cont d. notes to consolidated financial statements note 11 comprehensive income loss was as follows in millions three months nine months ended

after tax realized losses will reduce fourth quarter 2005 income by 45 million. the pre tax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet. in its energy marketing business, the corporation has entered into cash flow hedges to fix the purchase prices of natural gas, heating oil, residual fuel oil and electricity related to contracted future sales. at september 30, 2005, the net after tax deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income from these hedge contracts was 31

and financial condition. overview the corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, exploration and production e p and refining and marketing r m . the e p segment explores for, produces and sells crude oil and natural gas. the r m segment manufactures, purchases, trades and markets refined petroleum products and other energy products. net income was 790 million for the first nine months of 2005, including 760 million from e p activities and 286 million from r m operations. exploration and production worldwide oil and gas production averaged 312,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the third quarter of 2005, a decrease of 3 from the third quarter of 2004. hurricane related downtime in the gulf of mexico and temporary interruptions at several non operated fields in the north sea resulted in this decline. it is anticipated that 85 of gulf of mexico production impacted by hurricane activity will be restored in november and over 90 will be restored in december. as a result of the hurricanes and temporary interruptions at production facilities, fourth quarter production is estimated to be in the range of 320,000 to 330,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. the corporation recently announced an agreement with another oil company to acquire its 55 working interest in the deepwater section of the west mediterranean block 1 concession in egypt for 413 million. in a separate transaction, the same company will acquire the corporation s interests in eight fields located in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico for 404 million. the west mediterranean transaction is subject to egyptian government and other regulatory approvals and the permian basin transaction is subject to the exercise of preferential rights. completion of these transactions is expected in the first quarter of 2006. in early 2005, the corporation announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in samara nafta, a company operating in the volga urals region of russia. through the end of october 2005, samara nafta has acquired five additional licenses, increasing our total investment to approximately 230 million. production from our russian subsidiary averaged 8,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. refining and marketing the hovensa refinery benefited from a strong margin environment, but operated at somewhat reduced throughput as a result of a scheduled turnaround of a crude unit. marketing results were negatively impacted by lower margins, reflecting the higher cost of post hurricane product supply. 12 part i financial information cont d. results of operations net income for the third quarter of 2005 amounted to 272 million compared with 178 million in the third quarter of 2004. net income for the first nine months of 2005 was 790 million compared with 748 million in the first nine months of 2004. see the table below for a summary of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods. the after tax results by major operating activity for the three and nine month periods ended september 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows in millions, except per share data three months nine months ended september

in the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. after tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. the following items, on an after tax basis, are included in net income for the three and nine month periods ended september 30, 2005 and 2004 in millions three months nine months ended september 30 ended september 30 2005 2004

taxes resulting from incremental hurricane related expenses. substantially all of the pre tax costs were recorded in production expenses. the corporate tax charges of 31 million in the third quarter and 72 million in the first nine months of 2005 represent income tax provisions relating to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004. earnings in the first nine months of 2005 include income tax benefits of 11 million, reflecting the effect on deferred income taxes of a reduction in the income tax rate in denmark and a tax settlement in the united kingdom. year to date results also include a net gain of 11 million 18 million before income taxes on the disposition of a mature north sea asset. in addition, a net gain of 11 million 19 million before income taxes was recorded on a legal settlement reflecting the favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset sale. results for the first nine months of 2005 also include a charge of 7 million 10 million before income taxes for premiums on bond repurchases. comparison of results exploration and production following is a summarized income statement of the corporation s
