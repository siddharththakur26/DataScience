NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc. and subsidiaries (“Allis-Chalmers”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a
multi-faceted oilfield service company that provides services and equipment to oil and natural gas
exploration and production companies, domestically in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Colorado,
Oklahoma, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas, Alabama, West Virginia, offshore in the Gulf of
Mexico, and internationally, primarily in Argentina and Mexico. We operate in six sectors of the
oil and natural gas service industry: Rental Services; International Drilling; Directional
Drilling; Tubular Services; Underbalanced Drilling; and Production Services.

We derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and
equipment required to provide a service and rates per day for equipment and tools that we rent to
our customers. The price we charge for our services depends upon several factors, including the
level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular
geographic regions in which we operate. Contracts are awarded based on price, quality of service
and equipment and general reputation and experience of our personnel. The principal operating
costs are direct and indirect labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment,
insurance, equipment rentals, fuel, depreciation and general and administrative expenses.

On October 25, 2006 our Board of Directors approved the transfer of the listing of our common stock
from the American Stock Exchange (“AMEX”) to the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Our common
stock continued to trade on the AMEX under the symbol “ALY” until the transfer was completed on
March 22, 2007, at which time we began trading on the NYSE under the symbol “ALY”.

Basis of Presentation

Our unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
Accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. We
believe that the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate to make the information not
misleading. The unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the interim
periods. These unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2006. The results of operations for the interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year.

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year’s consolidated condensed financial
statements to conform with the current period presentation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty.
Accordingly, our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. While management believes
that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements
are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but are
not limited to, determining the following: allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of
long-lived assets and intangibles, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes
and valuation allowances. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional
information is obtained and as our operating environment changes.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance
with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. It prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1,
2007 and such adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Our policy is that we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as
a component of income tax expense. As of the date of adoption of FIN 48, we did not have any
accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax
benefits. For United States federal tax purposes, our tax returns for
the tax years 2001 through 2006 remain open for examination by the
tax authorities. Our foreign tax returns remain open for examination
for the tax years 2001 through 2006. Generally, for state tax
purposes, our 2002 through 2006 tax years remain open for examination
by the tax authorities under a four year statute of limitations,
however, certain states may keep their statute open for six to ten
years.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”), which is
intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements by defining fair
value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 157
and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities (“SFAS 159”), which permits entities to elect to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value. Upon adoption of SFAS 159, an entity may elect
the fair value option for eligible items that exist at the adoption date. Subsequent to the initial
adoption, the election of the fair value option should only be made at the initial recognition of
the asset or liability or upon a re-measurement event that gives rise to the new-basis of
accounting. All subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument are reported in earnings.
SFAS No. 159 does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and
liabilities to be recorded at fair value nor does it eliminate disclosure requirements included in
other accounting standards. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity’s
first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the provisions
of SFAS 159 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.

NOTE 2 — STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

We adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. Compensation cost for awards
granted prior to, but not vested, as of January 1, 2006 would be based on the grant date attributes
originally used to value those awards for pro forma purposes under SFAS No. 123. We adopted SFAS
No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option
pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. Under the
modified prospective method, we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of
December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the
remaining vesting periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. We
estimated forfeiture rates for the first three months of 2007 and 2006 based on our historical
experience.

The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free rate
of interest is the related U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods within the expected term of the
option at the time of grant. The dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero as we
have historically not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future. The
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock.

Our net income for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 includes approximately $453,000
and $0.9 million, respectively of compensation costs related to share-based payments. As of March
31, 2007 there is $623,000 of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock option
grants. We expect approximately $609,000 to be recognized over the remainder of 2007,
approximately $14,000 to be recognized in 2008.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the
difference between the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of the first
quarter of 2007 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that
would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on
March 31, 2007. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three months ended March
31, 2007 was $987,000. The total cash received from option exercises during the three months ended
March 31, 2007 was $301,000.

No options were granted in the three months ended March 31, 2007 and 2006.

We determine the fair value of RSAs based on the market price of our common stock on the date of
grant. Compensation cost for RSAs is primarily recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting
or service period and is net of forfeitures. As of March 31, 2007, there was $444,000 of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSAs. We expect approximately $330,000
to be recognized over the remainder of 2007, approximately $68,000 to be recognized in 2008 and
approximately $46,000 to be recognized in 2009.

NOTE 3 — INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

We compute income per common share in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per
Share. SFAS No. 128 requires companies with complex capital structures to present basic and
diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share are computed on the basis of the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share
is similar to basic earnings per share, but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of
potential common shares (e.g., convertible preferred stock, stock options, etc.) as if they had
been converted. Potential dilutive common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (e.g., those
that increase income per share) are excluded from diluted earnings per share.

The components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows (in thousands, except per
share amounts):

NOTE 4 — GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets are not permitted to be amortized. Goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets remain on the balance sheet and are tested for impairment on an
annual basis, or when there is reason to suspect that their values may have been diminished or
impaired. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets listed on the balance sheet totaled
$125.9 million and $125.8 million at March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Based on
impairment testing performed during 2006 pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 142, these assets
were not impaired.

Intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives.
Definite-lived intangible assets that continue to be amortized under SFAS No. 142 relate to our
purchase of customer-related and marketing-related intangibles. These intangibles have useful
lives ranging from five to ten years. Amortization of intangible assets for the three months ended
March 31, 2007 were $1.0 million, compared to $384,000 for the same period last year. At March 31,
2007, intangible assets totaled $31.8 million, net of $4.1 million of accumulated amortization.

Senior notes, bank loans and line of credit agreements

On January 18, 2006 and August 14, 2006, we closed on private offerings, to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, of $160.0 and $95.0 million
aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, respectively. The senior notes are due January 15,
2014 and bear interest at 9.0%. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisitions of Specialty
Rental Tools, Inc., or Specialty, and DLS Drilling, Logistics & Services Corporation, or DLS, to
repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes.

On January 18, 2006, we also executed an amended and restated credit agreement which provides for a
$25.0 million revolving line of credit with a maturity of January 2010. Our January 2006 amended
and restated credit agreement contains customary events of default and financial covenants and
limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay dividends or
make other distributions, create liens and sell assets. Our obligations under the January 2006
amended and restated credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets located in the
United States.

NOTE 6 — DEBT (Continued)

On December 18, 2006, we closed on a $300.0 million senior unsecured bridge loan. The bridge loan
was due 18 months after closing and bore a weighted average interest rate of 10.6%. The bridge
loan, which was repaid on January 29, 2007, was used to fund the acquisition of substantially all
of the assets of Oil & Gas Rental Services, Inc., or OGR.

In January 2007, we closed on a private offering, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, of $250.0 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due
2017. The proceeds of the senior notes offering, together with a portion of the proceeds of our
concurrent common stock offering, were used to repay the debt outstanding under our $300.0 million
bridge loan facility which we incurred to finance our acquisition of substantially all the assets
of OGR.

As part of our acquisition of DLS, we assumed various bank loans with floating interest rates based
on LIBOR plus a margin and terms ranging from 2 to 5 years. The weighted average interest rates
were 6.9% and 7.0% at March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The bank loans are
denominated in U.S. dollars and the outstanding amount due as of March 31, 2007 and December 31,
2006 were $6.7 million and $7.3 million, respectively.

Notes payable

As part of the acquisition of Mountain Compressed Air Inc., or Mountain Air, in 2001, we issued a
note to the sellers of Mountain Air in the original amount of $2.2 million accruing interest at a
rate of 5.75% per annum. The note was reduced to $1.5 million as a result of the settlement of a
legal action against the sellers in 2003. In March 2005, we reached an agreement with the sellers
and holders of the note as a result of an action brought against us by the sellers. Under the
terms of the agreement, we paid the holders of the note $1.0 million in cash, and agreed to pay an
additional $350,000 on June 1, 2006, and an additional $150,000 on June 1, 2007, in settlement of
all claims. At March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 the outstanding amounts due were $150,000.

In connection with the acquisition of Rogers Oil Tool Services, Inc., or Rogers, we issued to the
seller a note in the amount of $750,000. The note bears interest at 5.0% and is due April 3, 2009.

In connection with the purchase of Safco-Oil Field Products, Inc., or Safco, we agreed to pay a
total of $150,000 to the sellers in exchange for a non-compete agreement. We are required to make
annual payments of $50,000 through September 30, 2007. In connection with the purchase of Capcoil
Tubing Services, Inc., or Capcoil, we agreed to pay a total of $500,000 to two management employees
in exchange for non-compete agreements. We are required to make annual payments of $110,000
through May 2008. Total amounts due under these non-compete agreements at March 31, 2007 and
December 31, 2006 were $270,000.

In 2000 we compensated directors, including current directors Nederlander and Toboroff, who served
on the board of directors from 1989 to March 31, 1999 without compensation, by issuing promissory
notes totaling $325,000. The notes bore interest at the rate of 5.0%. At March 31, 2007 and
December 31, 2006, the principal and accrued interest on these notes totaled approximately $32,000.

Other debt

We have various equipment and vehicle financing loans with interest rates ranging from 5.0% to 8.7%
and terms of 2 to 5 years. As of March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the outstanding balances
for equipment and vehicle financing loans were $2.2 million and $3.5 million, respectively. In
April 2006 and August 2006, we obtained insurance premium financings in the amount of $1.9 million
and $896,000 with fixed interest rates of 5.6% and 6.0%, respectively. Under terms of the
agreements, amounts outstanding are paid over 10 month and 11 month repayment schedules. The
outstanding balance of these notes was approximately $331,000 and $1.0 million as of March 31, 2007
and December 31, 2006, respectively. We also have various capital leases with terms that expire in
2008. As of March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, amounts outstanding under capital leases were
$282,000 and $414,000, respectively.

NOTE 7 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

In January 2007 we closed on a public offering of 6.0 million shares of our common stock at a
public offering price of $17.65 per share. Net proceeds from the public offering, together with
the proceeds of our concurrent senior notes offering, were used to repay the debt outstanding under
our $300.0 million bridge loan facility, which we incurred to finance the OGR acquisition and for
general corporate purposes.

We also had options and warrants exercised in the first three months of 2007, which resulted in
76,386 shares of our common stock being issued for approximately $301,000. We recognized
approximately $453,000 of compensation expense related to stock options in the first three months
of 2007 that was recorded as capital in excess of par value (see Note 2).

NOTE 10 — LEGAL MATTERS

We are named from time to time in legal proceedings related to our activities prior to our
bankruptcy in 1988. However, we believe that we were discharged from liability for all such claims
in the bankruptcy and believe the likelihood of a material loss relating to any such legal
proceeding is remote.

We are also involved in various other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The
legal proceedings are at different stages; however, we believe that the likelihood of material loss
relating to any such legal proceeding is remote.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This report contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ
materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause
such differences include, but are not limited to, the general condition of the oil and natural gas
drilling industry, demand for our oil and natural gas service and rental products, and competition.
For more information on forward-looking statements please refer to the section
entitled“Forward-Looking Statements” on page 27.

Overview of Our Business

We are a multi-faceted oilfield services company that provides services and equipment to oil and
natural gas exploration and production companies, domestically in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico,
Colorado, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas, Alabama, West Virginia, offshore in the
Gulf of Mexico and internationally primarily in Argentina and Mexico. We currently operate in six
sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry: Rental Services; International Drilling;
Directional Drilling; Tubular Services; Underbalanced Drilling; and Production Services.

We derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and
equipment required to provide a service and rates per day for equipment and tools that we rent to
our customers. The price we charge for our services depends upon several factors, including the
level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular
geographic regions in which we operate. Contracts are awarded based on price, quality of service
and equipment, and the general reputation and experience of our personnel. The demand for drilling
services has historically been volatile and is affected by the capital expenditures of oil and
natural gas exploration and development companies, which can fluctuate based upon the prices of oil
and natural gas, or the expectation for the prices of oil and natural gas.

The number of working drilling rigs, typically referred to as the “rig count,” is an important
indicator of activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry. The rig count in the United
States increased from 862 as of December 31, 2002 to 1,747 on April 30, 2007 according to the Baker
Hughes rig count. Furthermore, directional and horizontal rig counts increased from 283 as of
December 31, 2002 to 740 on April 30, 2007, which accounted for 32.8% and 42.3% of the total U.S.
rig count, respectively.

Our cost of revenues represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and
maintenance of our equipment. The principal elements of these costs are direct and indirect labor
and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment, insurance, equipment rentals, fuel and
depreciation. Operating expenses do not fluctuate in direct proportion to changes in revenues
because, among other factors, we have a fixed base of inventory of equipment and facilities to
support our operations, and in periods of low drilling activity we may also seek to preserve labor
continuity to market our services and maintain our equipment.

Cyclical Nature of Equipment Rental and Services Industry

The oilfield services industry is highly cyclical. The most critical factor in assessing the
outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and
demand for natural gas. The peaks and valleys of demand are further apart than those of many other
cyclical industries. This is primarily a result of the industry being driven by commodity demand
and corresponding price increases. As demand increases, producers raise their prices. The price
escalation enables producers to increase their capital expenditures. The increased capital
expenditures ultimately result in greater revenues and profits for services and equipment
companies. The increased capital expenditures also ultimately result in greater production which
historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices.

Demand for our services has been strong throughout 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, due to high oil
and natural gas prices and increased demand and declining production costs for natural gas as
compared to other energy sources. Management believes the current market fundamentals are
indicative of a favorable long-term trend of activity in our markets. However, these factors could
be more than offset by other developments affecting the worldwide supply and demand for oil and
natural gas products.

Results of Operations

In December 2006, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Oil & Gas Rental Services,
Inc., or OGR. We report the operations of OGR in our Rental Services segment. In April 2006, we
acquired all of the outstanding stock of Rogers Oil Tool Services, Inc., or Rogers. We report the
operations of Rogers in our Tubular Services segment. In August 2006, we acquired all of the
outstanding stock of DLS Drilling, Logistics & Services Corporation, or DLS, and in December 2006,
we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Tanus Argentina S.A., or Tanus. We report the
operations of DLS and Tanus in our International Drilling segment. In October 2006, we acquired
all of the outstanding stock of Petro-Rentals, Incorporated, or Petro Rentals. We report the
operations of Petro Rentals in our Production Services segment. We consolidated the results of
these acquisitions from the day they were acquired.

The foregoing acquisitions affect the comparability from period to period of our historical
results, and our historical results may not be indicative of our future results.

Comparison of Three Months Ended March 31, 2007 and 2006

Our revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2007 were $135.9 million, an increase of 183.7%
compared to $47.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006. Revenues increased in all of
our business segments due to acquisitions completed in 2006, the investment in new capital
equipment, increased utilization of our rental equipment, improved pricing and the opening of new
operating locations. The most significant increase in revenues was due to the acquisition of DLS
on August 14, 2006 which expanded our operations to a sixth operating segment, International
Drilling. Revenues also increased significantly at our Rental Services segment due to the OGR
acquisition on December 18, 2006 and increased utilization of our rental equipment. Revenues for
our Production Services segment increased due to the acquisition of Petro-Rentals on October 17,
2006 and the addition of two coil tubing units in the fourth quarter of 2006. Our Tubular Services
segment also had a substantial increase in revenue, primarily due to the acquisition of Rogers as
of April 3, 2006, along with improved market conditions. Our Directional Drilling segment revenues
increased in the 2007 period compared to the 2006 period due to improved pricing for directional
drilling and the purchase of additional down-hole motors and measurement-while-drilling tools, or
MWD, tools which increased our capacity and market presence. Revenues increased at our
Underbalanced Drilling segment due to the purchase of additional equipment, principally new
compressor packages.

Our gross margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 increased 180.3% to $46.5 million, or 34.2%
of revenues, compared to $16.6 million, or 34.6%, of revenues for the three months ended March 31,
2006. The increase in gross profit is due to the increase in revenues in all of our business
segments. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the lower
gross margin that DLS achieves in the international drilling segment. The lower margin from DLS
was partly offset by the acquisition of OGR on December 18, 2006, in the high margin rental
services business, increased utilization of our rental equipment and the improved pricing for our
services generally. Also, contributing to our gross profit margin was the purchase of additional
MWD tools, the acquisition of Rogers and Petro Rentals, and the addition of two coil tubing units
in the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in
depreciation expense of 254.8% to $11.8 million for the first quarter of 2007 compared to $3.3
million for the first quarter of 2006. The increase is due to additional depreciable assets
resulting from the acquisitions and capital expenditures. Our cost of revenues consists
principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of our
equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. Because many of our costs are fixed, our gross profit
as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues.

General and administrative expense was $14.0 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared to $7.3
million for the first quarter of 2006. General and administrative expense increased due to the
additional expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the hiring of additional sales and
administrative personnel. General and administrative expense also increased because of increased
accounting fees and other expenses in connection with initiatives to strengthen our internal
control processes, costs related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance efforts and increased corporate
accounting and administrative staff. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative
expenses were 10.3% in the first quarter of 2007 compared to 15.3% in the first quarter of 2006.

We adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. We adopted SFAS No. 123R using
the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model for
the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. Therefore, we recorded an expense
of $453,000 and $0.9 million related to stock options for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The amount of option expense recorded in general and administrative expense
was $391,000 for the first quarter of 2007 and $859,000 for the first quarter of 2006 with the
balance being recorded as a direct cost.

21



Table of Contents

Amortization expense was $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared to $607,000 in the
first quarter of 2006. The increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of
intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions and the amortization of deferred financing
costs.

Income from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2007 totaled $31.0 million, a 259.3%
increase over income from operations of $8.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006,
reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross profit, offset in part by increased general and
administrative expenses and amortization. Our income from operations as a percentage of revenues
increased to 22.8% for the first quarter of 2007 from 18.0% for the first quarter of 2006, due
principally to the decrease in general, administrative and amortization expenses as a percentage of
revenue.

Our net interest expense was $12.8 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $3.6 million
for the first quarter of 2006. Interest expense increased in the first quarter of 2007 due to our
increased debt at a higher average interest rate. In January of 2007 we issued $250.0 million of
senior notes bearing interest at 8.5% to pay off, in part, the bridge loan utilized to complete the
OGR acquisition and for working capital. The bridge loan was outstanding until January 29, 2007
and had an average interest rate of 10.6%. In August of 2006 we issued an additional $95.0 million
of senior notes bearing interest at 9.0% to fund a portion of the acquisition of DLS. Interest
expense for the first quarter of 2007 includes the write-off of deferred financing fees of $1.2
million related to the repayment of the bridge loan.

Our provision for income taxes for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 was $6.2 million, or 33.9% of
our net income before income taxes, compared to $607,000, or 12.1% of our net income before income
taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2006. The increase in income taxes is attributable to
our higher operating income and a higher effective tax rate. The increase in our effective tax
rate is primarily attributable to our operations in Argentina which had an effective tax rate of
32.4% and the release of the valuation allowance against income taxes in United States in the
fourth quarter of 2006, which has resulted in deferred tax expense.

We had net income of $12.2 million for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 175.0%, compared
to net income of $4.4 million for the first quarter of 2006.

The following table compares revenues and income from operations for each of our business segments
and loss of income for general corporate purposes. Income (loss) from operations consists of
revenues less cost of revenues, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and
amortization:

Rental Services Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 for the Rental Services segment were $31.6 million,
an increase from $10.4 million in revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. Income from
operations increased to $13.9 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared to $5.0 million in the
first quarter of 2006. Our Rental Services revenues and operating income for the first quarter of
2007 increased compared to the prior year due primarily to the OGR acquisition and the increase in
utilization of our rental equipment. The OGR acquisition was completed on December 18, 2006.

Table of Contents

International Drilling Segment

On August 14, 2006, we acquired DLS which established our International Drilling segment. Revenues
for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 for the International Drilling segment were $48.9 million and
the income from operations was $9.6 million.

Directional Drilling Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 for our Directional Drilling segment were $20.5
million, an increase of 28.6% from the $15.9 million in revenues for the quarter ended March 31,
2006. Income from operations increased 64.5% to $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2007 from
$2.6 million for the comparable 2006 period. The improved results for this segment are due to
improved pricing for directional and horizontal drilling and the purchase of an additional six MWD
tools. Our increased operating expenses as a result of the addition of operations and personnel
were more than offset by the growth in revenues and improved pricing for our services.

Tubular Services Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 for the Tubular Services segment were $14.4 million,
an increase of 52.1% from the $9.5 million in revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
Revenues from domestic operations increased to $12.6 million in the first quarter of 2007 from $8.0
million in the first quarter of 2006 as a result of the acquisition of Rogers. Revenues from
operations in Mexico were $1.8 million for the first quarter of 2007 and $1.5 million for the first
quarter of 2006. Income from operations increased 72.5% to $3.2 million in the first quarter of
2007 from $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2006. The increase in this segment’s operating
income was due to our increased revenues from domestic operations.

Underbalanced Drilling Segment

Our Underbalanced Drilling revenues were $10.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007,
an increase of 16.0% compared to $9.1 million in revenues for the three months ended March 31,
2006. Income from operations increased to $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared to
income from operations of $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2006. Our Underbalanced Drilling
revenues and operating income for the first quarter of 2007 increased compared to the first quarter
of 2006 primarily due to our investment in additional equipment.

Production Services Segment

Revenues were $10.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007, an increase of 233.9%
compared to $3.0 million in revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2006. Income from
operations increased to $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared to $277,000 in the first
quarter of 2006. Our Production Services revenues and operating income for the first quarter of
2007 increased compared to the first quarter of 2006 due primarily to our acquisition of Petro
Rentals on October 17, 2006 and the addition of two coil tubing units in the fourth quarter of
2006.

General Corporate

General corporate expenses increased $0.9 million to $4.2 million for the three months ended March
31, 2007 compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006. The increase was due
to the increase in payroll costs and benefits for additional management, accounting and
administrative staff as a result of the acquisitions and to support our growing organization,
increased franchise taxes based on our increased authorized shares and increased audit fees and
professional services related to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance effort.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our on-going capital requirements arise primarily from our need to service our debt, to complete
acquisitions, to acquire and maintain equipment, and to fund our working capital requirements. Our
primary sources of liquidity are proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities and cash
flows from operations. We had cash and cash equivalents of $75.3 million at March 31, 2007
compared to $39.7 million at December 31, 2006.

Operating Activities

In the three months ended March 31, 2007, our operating activities provided $14.6 million in cash.
Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2007 was $12.2 million. Non-cash expenses totaled
$15.8 million during the first three months of 2007 consisting of $13.3 million of depreciation and
amortization, $1.5 million for deferred taxes related to timing differences, $1.2 million for the
write-off of loan fees related to the bridge loan that was repaid, $453,000 from the expensing of
stock options, $172,000 related to increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivables,
less $862,000 on the gain from asset disposals.

During the three months ended March 31, 2007, changes in operating assets and liabilities used
$13.4 million in cash, principally due to an increase of $22.0 million in accounts receivable, an
increase of $1.8 million in inventory, a decrease of $3.2 million in accrued interest, offset in
part by a decrease in other current assets of $7.3 million, an increase of $3.4 million in accounts
payable and an increase of $2.1 million in accrued expenses. Accounts receivable increased
primarily due to the increase in our revenues in the first three months of 2007. Other inventory
increased primarily due to the build-up of inventory to meet the demands of increased activity
levels. The decrease in accrued interest relates to the semi-annual payment of interest on our
9.0% senior notes issued in 2006 in January 2007. The decrease in other current assets primarily
relates to the collection of the working capital adjustment of the OGR acquisition for
approximately $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2007. The increase in accounts payable and
accrued expenses can be attributed to additional expenses related to higher activity levels.

In the three months ended March 31, 2006, we used $5.6 million in cash from operating activities.
Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2006 was $4.4 million. Non-cash additions to net
income totaled $4.9 million during the first three months of 2006 consisting of $3.9 million of
depreciation and amortization, $0.9 million from the expensing of stock options, $355,000 of
imputed interest related to the effective date of the Specialty Rental Tools, Inc., or Specialty,
acquisition, $180,000 related to increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivables,
offset by $514,000 on the gain from asset disposals.

During the three months ended March 31, 2006, changes in operating assets and liabilities used
$14.9 million in cash, principally due to an increase of $4.3 million in accounts receivable, an
increase of $1.5 million in inventory, a decrease of $1.3 million in accounts payable and a
decrease of $11.0 million in an accrued expense, offset in part by an increase of $2.8 million in
accrued interest. Accounts receivable increased from the December 31, 2005 level, due to the
increase in our revenues in the first three months of 2006, which is primarily attributable to the
Specialty acquisition. Inventory increased primarily due to the build-up of inventory to meet the
demands of our increased activity levels. The decrease in accrued expenses can be attributed to
accrued bonuses of Specialty that we paid in connection with the acquisition. The increase in
accrued interest relates to the interest on our 9.0% senior notes that is only paid semi-annually.

Investing Activities

During the three months ended March 31, 2007, we used $19.6 million in investing activities,
consisting of $22.3 million for capital expenditures, offset by $2.7 million of proceeds from
equipment sales. Included in the $22.3 million for capital expenditures was $ 8.5 million for
drill pipe and other equipment used in our Rental Services segment, $4.3 million primarily for
additional MWD equipment used in the Directional Drilling segment, $2.7 million for additional
equipment in our International Drilling segment, $2.7 million for our Tubular Services segment and
$1.5 million for our Underbalanced Drilling segment, principally new compressor packages. A
majority of our equipment sales relate to items “lost in hole” by our customers.

During the three months ended March 31, 2006, we used $89.8 million in investing activities,
consisting of $83.4 million for the acquisition of Specialty, net of cash received and $7.6 million
for capital expenditures, offset by $1.2 million of proceeds from equipment sales. Included in the
$7.6 million for capital expenditures was $2.6 million for the expansion of our MWD equipment used
in the Directional Drilling segment and $2.2 million for additional equipment in our Underbalanced
Drilling segment. A majority of our equipment sales relate to items “lost in hole” by our
customers.

Financing Activities

During the three months ended March 31, 2007, financing activities provided $40.6 million in cash.
We received $250.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt, repaid $302.8 million in borrowings
under long-term debt facilities, including repayments of the bridge loan, and paid $7.0 million in
debt issuance costs. We also received $100.1 million from the issuance of our common stock in a
public offering, net of expenses along with $301,000 in proceeds from the exercise of options and
warrants.

During the three months ended March 31, 2006, financing activities provided a net of $104.1 million
in cash. We received $161.4 million in proceeds from long-term debt, repaid $43.5 million in
borrowings under long-term facilities, repaid $3.0 million in related party debt, repaid $6.4
million under our line of credit and paid $5.3 million in debt issuance costs. We also received
$972,000 in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants. On January 18, 2006, we closed on
a private offering of $160.0 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes. The notes are
due January 15, 2014 and bear interest at 9.0%. The proceeds from the sale of the notes were used
to fund the acquisition of Specialty.

At March 31, 2007, we had $515.7 million in outstanding indebtedness, of which $510.4 million was
long term debt and $5.3 million is due within one year.

On January 18, 2006 and August 14, 2006, we closed on private offerings, to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, of $160.0 and $95.0 million
aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, respectively. The senior notes are due January 15,
2014 and bear interest at 9.0%. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisitions of Specialty and
DLS, to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes.

On January 18, 2006, we also executed an amended and restated credit agreement which provides for a
$25.0 million revolving line of credit which matures in January 2010. In April 2007 we entered
into a second amended and restated credit agreement which increased our revolving line of credit to
$62.0 million, which matures in April 2012. Our amended and restated credit agreement contains
customary events of default and financial covenants and limits our ability to incur additional
indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay dividends or make other distributions, create liens
and sell assets. Our obligations under the amended and restated credit agreement are secured by
substantially all of our assets located in the United States.

On December 18, 2006, we closed on a $300.0 million senior unsecured bridge loan. The bridge loan
was due 18 months after closing and bore a weighted average interest rate of 10.6%. The bridge
loan, which was repaid on January 29, 2007, was used to fund the acquisition of substantially all
of the assets of OGR.

In January 2007, we closed on a private offering, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, of $250.0 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due
2017. The proceeds of the senior notes offering, together with a portion of the proceeds of our
concurrent common stock offering, were used to repay the debt outstanding under our $300.0 million
bridge loan facility which we incurred to finance our acquisition of substantially all the assets
of OGR.

As part of our acquisition of DLS, we assumed various bank loans with floating interest rates based
on LIBOR plus a margin and terms ranging from 2 to 5 years. The weighted average interest rates
were 6.9% and 7.0% at March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The bank loans are
denominated in U.S. dollars and the outstanding amount due as of March 31, 2007 and December 31,
2006 were $6.7 million and $7.3 million, respectively.

As part of the acquisition of Mountain Compressed Air Inc., or Mountain Air, in 2001, we issued a
note to the sellers of Mountain Air in the original amount of $2.2 million accruing interest at a
rate of 5.75% per annum. The note was reduced to $1.5 million as a result of the settlement of a
legal action against the sellers in 2003. In March 2005, we reached an agreement with the sellers
and holders of the note as a result of an action brought against us by the sellers. Under the
terms of the agreement, we paid the holders of the note $1.0 million in cash, and agreed to pay an
additional $350,000 on June 1, 2006, and an additional $150,000 on June 1, 2007, in settlement of
all claims. At March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 the outstanding amounts due were $150,000.

In connection with the acquisition of Rogers, we issued to the seller a note in the amount of
$750,000. The note bears interest at 5.0% and is due April 3, 2009.

In connection with the purchase of Safco-Oil Field Products, Inc., or Safco, we agreed to pay a
total of $150,000 to the sellers in exchange for a non-compete agreement. We are required to make
annual payments of $50,000 through September 30, 2007. In connection with the purchase of Capcoil
Tubing Services, Inc., or Capcoil, we agreed to pay a total of $500,000 to two management employees
in exchange for non-compete agreements. We are required to make annual payments of $110,000
through May 2008. Total amounts due under these non-compete agreements at March 31, 2007 and
December 31, 2006 were $270,000.

Table of Contents

In 2000 we compensated directors, including current directors Nederlander and Toboroff, who served
on the board of directors from 1989 to March 31, 1999 without compensation, by issuing promissory
notes totaling $325,000. The notes bore interest at the rate of 5.0%. At March 31, 2007 and
December 31, 2006, the principal and accrued interest on these notes totaled approximately $32,000.
We have various equipment and vehicle financing loans with interest rates ranging from 5.0% to
8.7% and terms of 2 to 5 years. As of March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the outstanding
balances for equipment and vehicle financing loans were $2.2 million and $3.5 million,
respectively. In April 2006 and August 2006, we obtained insurance premium financings in the
amount of $1.9 million and $896,000 with fixed interest rates of 5.6% and 6.0%, respectively.
Under the terms of the agreements, amounts outstanding are paid over 10 month and 11 month
repayment schedules. The outstanding balance of these notes was approximately $331,000 and $1.0
million as of March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. We also have various capital
leases with terms that expire in 2008. As of March 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, amounts
outstanding under capital leases were $282,000 and $414,000, respectively.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off balance sheet arrangements, other than normal operating leases and employee
contracts, that have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources. We do not guarantee obligations of any unconsolidated
entities. At March 31, 2007, we had a $25.0 million revolving line of credit with a maturity of
January 2010. At March 31, 2007, no amounts were borrowed on the facility but availability is
reduced by outstanding letters of credit of $9.5 million.

Capital Requirements

We have identified capital expenditure projects that will require approximately $58.0 million for
the remainder of 2007, exclusive of any acquisitions. We believe that our current cash generated
from operations, cash available under our credit facilities and cash on hand will provide
sufficient funds for our identified projects.

We intend to implement a growth strategy of increasing the scope of services through both internal
growth and acquisitions. We are regularly involved in discussions with a number of potential
acquisition candidates. The acquisition of assets could require additional financing. We also
expect to make capital expenditures to acquire and to maintain our existing equipment. Our
performance and cash flow from operations will be determined by the demand for our services which
in turn are affected by our customers’ expenditures for oil and gas exploration and development,
and industry perceptions and expectations of future oil and natural gas prices in the areas where
we operate. We will need to refinance our existing debt facilities as they become due and provide
funds for capital expenditures and acquisitions. To effect our expansion plans, we may require
additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in
raising the additional debt or equity capital or that we can do so on terms that will be acceptable
to us.

Recent Developments

On April 26, 2007, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which increased
our revolving line of credit to $62.0 million, and has a final maturity date of April 26, 2012.
The amended and restated credit agreement contains customary events of default and financial
covenants and limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay
dividends or make other distributions, create liens and sell assets. Our obligations under the
amended and restated credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets located in the
United States.

Critical Accounting Policies

Please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 for a description of
other policies that are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of
operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business
operations is discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. No
material changes to such information have occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2007.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance
with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. It prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1,
2007 and such adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

26



Table of Contents

Our policy is that we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as
a component of income tax expense. As of the date of adoption of FIN 48, we did not have any
accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits. For United States federal tax purposes, our tax returns for
the tax years 2001 through 2006 remain open for examination by the
tax authorities. Our foreign tax returns remain open for examination
for the tax years 2001 through 2006. Generally, for state tax
purposes, our 2002 through 2006 tax years remain open for examination
by the tax authorities under a four year statute of limitations,
however, certain states may keep their statute open for six to ten
years.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”), which is
intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements by defining fair
value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 157
and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities (“SFAS 159”), which permits entities to elect to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value. Upon adoption of SFAS 159, an entity may elect
the fair value option for eligible items that exist at the adoption date. Subsequent to the initial
adoption, the election of the fair value option should only be made at the initial recognition of
the asset or liability or upon a re-measurement event that gives rise to the new-basis of
accounting. All subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument are reported in earnings.
SFAS No. 159 does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and
liabilities to be recorded at fair value nor does it eliminate disclosure requirements included in
other accounting standards. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity’s
first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the provisions
of SFAS 159 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, regarding our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends,
plans, believes, seeks, estimates and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. However, these are not the exclusive means of identifying
forward-looking statements. Although such forward-looking statements reflect our good faith
judgment, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known to us.
Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and
actual outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the
forward-looking statements. Further information about the risks and uncertainties that may impact
us are described under “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2006. You should read those sections carefully. You should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this quarterly report. We
undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any
event or circumstance occurring after the date of this quarterly report or currently unknown facts
or conditions or the occurrence of unanticipated events.




ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency
exchange risks.

Interest Rate Risk.

Fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable
rate debt obligations expose us to market risk. We are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in
interest rates affecting our adjustable rate debt, and any future refinancing of our fixed rate
debt and our future debt.

As part of our acquisition of DLS, we assumed various bank loans carrying variable interest rates
with an outstanding balance of $6.7 million as of March 31, 2007.

We have also been subject to interest rate market risk for short-term invested cash and cash
equivalents. The principal of such invested funds would not be subject to fluctuating value
because of their highly liquid short-term nature. As of March 31, 2007, we had $64.2 million
invested in short-term investments.

27



Table of Contents

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.

We have designated the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for our operations in international
locations as we contract with customers, purchase equipment and finance capital using the U.S.
dollar. Local currency transaction gains and losses, arising from remeasurement of certain assets
and liabilities denominated in local currency, are included in our consolidated statements of
income. We conduct business in Mexico through our Mexican partner, Matyep. This business exposes
us to foreign exchange risk. To control this risk, we provide for payment in U.S. dollars.
However, we have historically provided our partner a discount upon payment equal to 50% of any loss
suffered by our partner as a result of devaluation of the Mexican peso between the date of
invoicing and the date of payment. To date, such payments have not been material in amount.




ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we have evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e)
and 15d – 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the “Exchange Act”. This
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based on this evaluation, these
officers have concluded that, as of March 31, 2007, our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed
by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules and
forms.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures.

(b) Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

The following changes were made in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this
report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting:




 
•
 
We started the foundation of an internal audit department. We have written a charter
and have started to hire staff for the department.






PART II. OTHER INFORMATION




ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

On January 12, 2007, we issued 3,153 shares to Capital Growth Financial LLLC (“Capital Growth”)
pursuant to a cashless exercise of a warrant to purchase 4,000 shares of our common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, at an exercise price of $4.65 per share. We received no cash proceeds from
this transaction. The issuance of the shares to Capital Growth was exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act under Section 4(2) of the Securities act, which did not involve
a public offering.

ARTICLE II.THE REVOLVING COMMITMENT AND BORROWINGS
     2.01 Revolving Loans. Subject to and in reliance upon the terms, conditions, representations,
and warranties in the Loan Documents, each Lender severally, but not jointly, agrees to make
revolving loans (each such loan a “Revolving Loan”) to Borrower from time to time on any Business
Day during the period from the Second Amended and Restated Closing Date to the Maturity Date, in an
aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share
of one or more Revolving Loan Borrowings not to exceed, when aggregated with the Outstanding Amount
of the L/C Obligations, such Lender’s Revolving Commitment. Revolving Loan Borrowings may be
repaid and reborrowed from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents; provided that, each such Revolving Loan Borrowing must occur on a Business Day and no
later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date. Revolving Loans may be Base
Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein; provided, however, all Revolving
Loan Borrowings made on the Second Amended and Restated Closing Date shall be made as Base Rate Loans.
     2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Revolving Loans.

     (a) Each Borrowing, each conversion of Revolving Loans from one interest rate Type to the
other, and each continuation of Revolving Loans as the same interest rate Type shall be made upon
the Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone.
Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., New York
time, three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or
continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, and one Business Day prior to the requested date of any
Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Base Rate Loans. Each such telephonic notice must
be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Notice,
appropriately completed and signed by an authorized officer of the Borrower. Each Borrowing of,
conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000
or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate
Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof.
Each Borrowing Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is
requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Revolving Loans from one interest rate Type to the other,
or a continuation of Revolving Loans as the same interest rate Type, (ii) the requested date of the
Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii)
the principal amount of Revolving Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (v) the interest
rate Type of Revolving Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Revolving Loans are to be
converted, and (vi) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If
the Borrower fails to specify the interest rate Type for a Revolving Loan in a Borrowing Notice or
if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the
applicable Revolving Loans shall be made or continued as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any
such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest
Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower
requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such
Borrowing Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an
Interest Period of one month.
     (b) Following receipt of a Borrowing Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
each Lender of its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Revolving Loans, and if no timely notice of a
conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each
Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in the preceding 
25


 

subsection. In the case of a Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Revolving Loan
available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent’s
Office not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the Business Day specified in the applicable
Borrowing Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.01 and
Section 4.03 (and in the case of a Revolving Loan to fund a Permitted Acquisition, Section 4.04),
the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds
as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the
books of the Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such
funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to the Administrative Agent by the
Borrower; provided, however, that if, on the date of the Borrowing there are L/C Borrowings
outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied, first, to the payment in full of
any such L/C Borrowings, and second, to the Borrower as provided above.

     (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted
only on the last day of the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of
a Default or Event of Default, no Revolving Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as
Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders, and the Required Lenders may
demand that any or all of the then outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans be converted to Base Rate
Loans at the end of the then current Interest Period.

     (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the
interest rate applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan upon determination of such interest rate. The
determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence
of manifest error.

     (e) After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Revolving Loans from one
interest rate Type to the other, and all continuations of Revolving Loans as the same interest rate
Type, there shall not be more than six (6) Interest Periods in effect at any given time with
respect to Revolving Loans.

     2.03 Prepayments.

     (a) Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent,
at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay in whole or in part Revolving Loans outstanding
under the Revolver Facility without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be
received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, (A) three Business
Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans, and (B) one Business Day prior to
any date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in
a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any
prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of
$500,000 in excess thereof. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment
and the Type(s) of Revolving Loans and the interest rate Type(s) to be prepaid. The Administrative
Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of such Lender’s Pro
Rata Share of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make
such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the
date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all
accrued interest thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.
Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Revolving Loans of the Lenders in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Shares.

26



 

     Unless a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would arise as a result
thereof, any payment or prepayment of the Revolving Loans (including prepayments pursuant to
Section 2.03(b)) may be reborrowed by Borrower, subject to the terms and conditions hereof.
     (b) Mandatory Prepayments from Net Cash Proceeds.

     (i) If any portion of the Reduction Amount from any Triggering Sale (including any
deferred purchase price therefor) has not been Reinvested within one hundred eighty (180)
days from the receipt by Borrower or any Subsidiary of such Reduction Amount (including
receipt of any deferred payments for any such Triggering Sale or portion thereof, if and
when received), then on the Business Day following such one hundred eightieth (180th) day an
amount equal to the portion of the Reduction Amount that is not so Reinvested shall be
applied as provided in Section 2.03(b)(iii). Net Cash Proceeds from Insurance Payments and
Dispositions that equal, when aggregated with Net Cash Proceeds from all Insurance Payments
and Dispositions since the Second Amended and Restated Closing Date, an amount less than the
Threshold Amount shall not be required to be applied pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(iii).
     (ii) Upon receipt by Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Reduction Amount, the Borrower
shall deliver a Triggering Sale Certificate to the Administrative Agent and each Lender
pursuant to Section 6.02(c). . If such Reduction Amount has not been Reinvested within one
hundred eighty (180) days following its receipt by Borrower or any Subsidiary, on the
Business Day following such one hundred eightieth (180th) day, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate from a Responsible Officer of the
Borrower demonstrating pro forma compliance with the Fixed Asset Coverage Ratio covenant set
forth in Section 7.19(c) after giving effect to all Triggering Sales.
     (iii) Application of Mandatory Prepayments. All amounts required to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(i) shall be applied as follows:
     First, to the payment of any L/C Borrowing;

     Second, to the payment of any unpaid fees or expenses of the Administrative
Agent;
     Third, to the Revolving Loan (without a corresponding reduction in the
Aggregate Revolving Commitment); and
     Fourth, after all Revolving Loans have been repaid and if any Default or any
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to Cash Collateralize L/C
Obligations.

     Within the parameters of the applications set forth above, prepayments shall be applied first
to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Rate Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities;
provided, however, unless a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would
arise as a result thereof, any prepayment may be reborrowed by Borrower, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof. Any amounts used to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to clause
Fourth above shall be released to the Borrower when all Defaults or Events of Default referred to in said clause are no longer continuing.
27


 

     (c) Prepayments by Reason of Aggregate Revolving Commitment Exceeded. If on any date
the Outstanding Amount of all Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations shall exceed the Aggregate
Revolving Commitment, then the Borrower shall immediately make mandatory prepayments of Revolving
Loans equal to such excess, and if any such excess remains after such prepayments, to the extent of
such excess the Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations.
     (d) Prepayments: Interest/Funding Loss. All prepayments under this Section 2.03 shall
be subject to Section 3.05, but otherwise without premium or penalty, and shall be accompanied by
interest on the principal amount prepaid through the date of prepayment.
     2.04 Reduction or Termination of Commitments. The Borrower may, upon notice to the
Administrative Agent terminate the Revolving Commitment prior to the Maturity Date to an amount not
less than the sum of the Outstanding Amount of the then existing (a) Revolver Principal Debt and
(b) L/C Obligations; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative
Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., five Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction,
and (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or any whole
multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Lenders of any such notice of reduction or termination. Once reduced in accordance with this
Section, the Revolving Commitment may not be increased. Any reduction of the Revolving Commitment
shall be applied to the corresponding Revolving Commitment of each Lender according to its Pro Rata
Share. All commitment fees on the portion of the Revolving Commitment so terminated which have
accrued to the effective date of any termination of the Revolving Commitment shall be paid on the
effective date of such termination.
     2.05 Repayment of Revolving Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the
Maturity Date the aggregate Revolver Principal Debt outstanding on such date.
     2.06 Interest.
     (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per
annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate and (ii) each
Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable
borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
     (b) While any Event of Default exists or after acceleration (i) the Borrower shall pay
interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations at a fluctuating interest rate per
annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, and
(ii) accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest)
shall be due and payable upon demand.
     (c) Interest on each Revolving Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest
hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment,
and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.
     (d) If the designated rate applicable to any Borrowing exceeds the Maximum Rate, the rate of
interest on such Borrowing shall be limited to the Maximum Rate, but any subsequent reductions in
such designated rate shall not reduce the rate of interest thereon below the Maximum Rate until the total

28


 

amount of interest accrued thereon equals the amount of interest which would have accrued thereon
if such designated rate had at all times been in effect. In the event that at maturity (stated or
by acceleration), or at final payment of the Outstanding Amount of any Revolving Loans or L/C
Obligations, the total amount of interest paid or accrued is less than the amount of interest which
would have accrued if such designated rates had at all times been in effect, then, at such time and
to the extent permitted by Law, the Borrower shall pay an amount equal to the difference between
(a) the lesser of the amount of interest which would have accrued if such designated rates had at
all times been in effect and the amount of interest which would have accrued if the Maximum Rate
had at all times been in effect, and (b) the amount of interest actually paid or accrued on such Outstanding Amount.
     2.07 Fees.
     (a) Commitment Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share (based on its Revolving Commitment as
a percentage of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment) a Revolver Facility commitment fee equal to the
Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Revolving Commitment (subject
to reduction pursuant to Section 2.04) exceeds the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving
Loans plus (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations. The Revolver Facility commitment fee
shall accrue at all times from the Second Amended and Restated Closing Date until the Maturity
Date, shall be calculated quarterly in arrears and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on
the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such
date to occur after the Second Amended and Restated Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date. The
Revolver Facility commitment fee shall accrue at all times, including at any time during which one
or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met; and
     (b) Arranger’s and Administrative Agent’s Fees. On the Second Amended and
Restated Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay certain fees to the Arranger and Administrative Agent
to be shared between them and the Borrower shall pay certain fees to the Administrative Agent for
the Administrative Agent’s own account as an administrative agency fee, in the amounts and at the
times specified in the letter agreement dated March 13, 2007 (the “Agent/Arranger Fee Letter”),
between the Borrower, the Arranger and the Administrative Agent. Such fees shall be fully earned
when paid and shall be nonrefundable for any reason whatsoever. Additionally, Borrower shall pay
to the Administrative Agent for the Administrative Agent’s own account the fees in the amounts and
on the dates specified in the Agent/Arranger Fee Letter.
     2.08 Computation of Interest and Fees. Computation of interest on Base Rate Loans shall be
calculated on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and the actual number of
days elapsed. Computation of all other types of interest and all fees shall be calculated on the
basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed. Interest shall accrue on each
Revolving Loan for the day on which the Revolving Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Revolving
Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Revolving Loan or such portion is paid;
provided that any Revolving Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day.
     2.09 Evidence of Debt.
     (a) The Revolving Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or
records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of
business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive,
29


 

absent manifest error, of the amount of the Revolving Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and
the interest and payments thereon. Any failure so to record or any error in doing so shall not,
however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing
with respect to the Revolving Loans or the L/C Obligations. In the event of any conflict between
the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the
Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of such Lender shall
control. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, such Lender’s
Revolving Loans may be evidenced by one or more Revolver Notes. Each Lender may attach schedules
to its Revolver Note(s) and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of
the applicable Revolving Loans and payments with respect thereto.
     (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a), each Lender and the
Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records
evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the
event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and
the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the
Administrative Agent shall control.
     2.10 Payments Generally.
     (a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for
any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account
of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent’s Office in
Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the date
specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata
Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by
wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent
after 11:00 a.m., New York time, shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and
any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.
     (b) Subject to the definition of “Interest Period,” if any payment to be made by the Borrower
shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following
Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
     (c) If no Default or Event of Default exists and if no order of application is otherwise
specified in the Loan Documents, payments and prepayments of the Obligations shall be applied first
to fees, second to accrued interest then due and payable on the Outstanding Amount of Revolving
Loans and L/C Obligations, and then to the remaining Obligations in the order and manner as Borrower may direct.
     (d) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative
Agent to pay fully the Obligations, or if a Default or Event of Default exists, any payment or
prepayment shall be applied in the following order: (i) to the payment of enforcement expenses
incurred by the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, including Attorney Costs; (ii) to the
ratable payment of all other fees, expenses, and indemnities for which the Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent or Lenders have not been paid or reimbursed in accordance with the Loan Documents (as used in this
Section 2.10(d)(ii), a “ratable payment” for any Lender, the Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent shall be, on
30


 

any date of determination, that proportion which the portion of the total fees, expenses, and
indemnities owed to such Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent bears to the
total aggregate fees and indemnities owed to all Lenders and the Administrative Agent and
Collateral Agent on such date of determination); (iii) to the ratable payment of accrued and unpaid
interest on the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans, Outstanding L/C Obligations, the Outstanding
Amount of Obligations under Lender Hedging Agreements and the Outstanding Amount of Obligations
under Banking Service Obligations; and (iv) to the payment of the remaining Obligations, if any, in
the order and manner the Required Lenders deem appropriate.
     (e) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent prior to the date
any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower
or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume
that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but
shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the
Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the
Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then:
     (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand
repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made
available to such Lender in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in
respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the
Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative
Agent in immediately available funds, at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect;
and
     (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand
pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, together
with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the
Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the
Administrative Agent (the “Compensation Period”) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal
Funds Rate from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the
Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Loan,
included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith
upon the Administrative Agent’s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand
therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative
Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal
to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Revolving Commitment or to
prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any
Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
     A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this
subsection (e) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
     (f) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Revolving Loan to
be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and the
conditions to the applicable Borrowing set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds
as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
31



 

     (g) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Loans are several and not
joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan on any date required hereunder shall
not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Revolving Loan or purchase
its participation.
     (h) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any
Revolving Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender
that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Revolving Loan in any particular place or
manner.
     2.11 Sharing of Payments. If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender
shall obtain on account of the Revolving Loans made by it, or the participations in the L/C
Obligations, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder)
thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b)
purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Revolving Loans made by them, and/or
such subparticipations in the participations in L/C Obligations held by them, as shall be necessary
to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Revolving Loan or
such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided, however, that if all
or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender, such
purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing
Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender’s
ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender’s required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or
other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered.
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
set-off, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such
Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The
Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of
manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the
Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation
pursuant to this Section shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices,
requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the
portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the
original owner of the Obligations purchased.

     2.12 Pari Passu Lien Securing Lender Hedging Agreements and Banking Service Obligations.
All Obligations arising under the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, Obligations under
this Agreement, Obligations under any Lender Hedging Agreement (but not Indebtedness of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary owing to any non-Lender or non-Lender Affiliate which enters into a Swap
Contract with the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower), and Obligations under any Banking
Service Obligation shall be secured pari passu by the Collateral. No Lender or any Affiliate of a
Lender shall have any voting rights under any Loan Document as a result of the existence of
obligations owed to it under any such Lender Hedging Agreement or Banking Service Obligation.

     2.13 Letters of Credit.

     (a) The Letter of Credit Commitment.

32



 

     (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in
reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.13, (1) from
time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Second Amended and Restated
Closing Date until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the
account of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and to amend or renew Letters of Credit
previously issued by it, in accordance with subsection (b) below, and (2) to honor drafts
under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters
of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries; provided that the L/C
Issuer shall not be obligated to make any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of
Credit, and no Lender shall be obligated to participate in any Letter of Credit, if as of
the date of such L/C Credit Extension, (w) the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations and
all Revolving Loans would exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitment, (y) the aggregate
Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender’s Pro Rata Share
of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations would exceed such Lender’s Revolving
Commitment, or (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations would exceed the Letter of
Credit Sublimit. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Borrower’s ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and
accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to
replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed.
The Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto, and from
and after the Second Amended and Restated Closing Date shall be subject to and governed by
the terms and conditions hereof.
     (ii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:

     (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator
shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such
Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority
with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer
refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit
in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of
Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is
not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Second Amended and
Restated Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss,
cost or expense which was not applicable on the Second Amended and Restated Closing
Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;
     (B) subject to Section 2.13(b)(iii), the expiry date of such requested Letter
of Credit would occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance or last
renewal, unless the Required Lenders have approved such expiry date;
     (C) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur after the
Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless all the Lenders have approved such expiry date;
     (D) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of
the L/C Issuer generally applicable to all borrowers; or 
33



 

     (E) such Letter of Credit is in a face amount less than $100,000, or is to be
used for a purpose other than as described in Section 6.12 or is denominated in a
currency other than Dollars.
     (iii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A)
the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its
amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does
not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.

     (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Evergreen Letters of Credit.

     (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the
request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by
a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received
by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, at
least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the L/C Issuer may agree in a
particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of
amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter
of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory
to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which
shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name
and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such
beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be
presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters
as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding
Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail
satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date
of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed
amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require.
     (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer will
confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative
Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if
not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Upon receipt
by the L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the requested issuance
or amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit
for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be,
in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer’s usual and customary business practices.
Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a
participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender’s
Pro Rata Share times the amount of such Letter of Credit.
     (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the
L/C Issuer may, in it sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that
has automatic renewal provisions (each, an “Evergreen Letter of Credit”); provided that any
such
34


 

Evergreen Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such renewal at least
once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of
Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the
“Nonrenewal Notice Date”) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time
such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower
shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such renewal.
Once an Evergreen Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have
authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the renewal of such Letter of
Credit at any time to a date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided,
however, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such renewal if it has received notice at
least five Business Days immediately preceding the Nonrenewal Notice Date (1) from the
Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such renewal or
(2) from any Lender stating that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
Section 4.03 is not then satisfied and directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such renewal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the L/C Issuer shall have no
obligation to permit the renewal of any Evergreen Letter of Credit at any time.
     (iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter
of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C
Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete
copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.
     (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

     (i) Upon any drawing under any Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time,
on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an
“Honor Date”), the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent
in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the
L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the
Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the “Unreimbursed Amount”), and such
Lender’s Pro Rata Share thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
requested a Borrowing under the Revolver Facility of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the
Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and
multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject
to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment and the
conditions set forth in Section 4.03 (other than the delivery of a Borrowing Notice). Any
notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section
2.13(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the
lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect
of such notice.
     (ii) Each Lender (including the Lender acting as L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice
pursuant to Section 2.13(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent’s Office in an amount equal to its Pro
Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the
Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the
provisions of Section 2.13(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be
deemed to have made a Base Rate Revolving Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent
shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.
35



 

     (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a
Borrowing of Base Rate Revolving Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.03
cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred
from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so
refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest)
and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Lender’s payment to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.13(c)(ii) shall
be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute
an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this
Section 2.13.
     (iv) Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section
2.13(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit,
interest in respect of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the
account of the L/C Issuer.
     (v) Each Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the
L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section
2.13(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance,
including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such
Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason
whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of Default, or (C) any
other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. Any
such reimbursement shall not relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to
reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any
Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.
     (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account
of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.13(c) by the time specified in Section 2.13(c)(ii), the L/C
Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative
Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such
payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C
Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A
certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent)
with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.
     (d) Repayment of Participations.

     (i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and
has received from any Lender such Lender’s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in
accordance with Section 2.13(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the
L/C Issuer any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower
or otherwise, including proceeds of cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative
Agent), or any payment of interest thereon, the Administrative Agent will distribute to such
Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.
     (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C
Issuer pursuant to Section 2.13(c)(i) is required to be returned, each Lender shall pay to
the
36


 

Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand
of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date
such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate
from time to time in effect.
     (e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer
for each drawing under each Letter of Credit, and to repay each L/C Borrowing and each drawing
under a Letter of Credit that is refinanced by a Borrowing of Revolving Loans, shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:
     (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or
any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;
     (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, set-off, defense or other right that the
Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of
Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting),
the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument
relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;
     (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of
Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the
transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such
Letter of Credit;
     (iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of
a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of
Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person
purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of
creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary
or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or
     (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
the foregoing, that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower.
     The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto
that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower’s
instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The
Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its
correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.
     The Borrower shall also promptly examine any documents sent to the L/C Issuer in connection
with a drawing under a Letter of Credit after the L/C Issuer provides copies of such documents to
the Borrower and the Borrower shall immediately notify the L/C Issuer of any objection or claim of
noncompliance of such documents with the requirements of the Letter of Credit.
37



 

     (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any
drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any
document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter
of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the
authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. No Agent-Related Person nor any
of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to
any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the
approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable, (ii) any action taken or omitted in
the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness,
validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter
of Credit Application. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any
beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that
this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower’s pursuing such rights and
remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.
No Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the
L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through
(v) of Section 2.13(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be
liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to
consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused
by the L/C Issuer’s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer’s willful failure to
pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and
certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear
on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity
or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a
Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part,
which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.
     (g) Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, (i) if the L/C
Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing
has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any
Letter of Credit may for any reason remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, the
Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations
(in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount). The Borrower hereby grants the Administrative
Agent and Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, a Lien on all such
cash and deposit accounts at any Lender.
     (h) Applicability of ISP98. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and
the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the “International Standby Practices
1998” published by the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version
thereof as may be in effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each Letter of Credit.
     (i) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share a letter of credit fee for each Letter
of Credit issued equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily undrawn amount under each
Letter of Credit. Such fee for each Letter of Credit shall be due and payable on the last Business
Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after
the issuance of such Letter of Credit, and on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date.
38


 

     (j) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. The
Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee in an amount with
respect to each Letter of Credit issued equal to the greater of (i) $500 and (ii) 1/8 of 1%
calculated on the face amount thereof. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C
Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing
fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from
time to time in effect. Such fees and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.
     (k) Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the event of any conflict between
the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit Application, the terms hereof shall control.
ARTICLE III.TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
     3.01 Taxes.
     (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of the Administrative Agent
or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any
and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees,
withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto; excluding, in the case
of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, (i) taxes imposed on or measured by its net income,
and franchise taxes (including the Texas franchise tax) imposed on it (in lieu of net income
taxes), by the United States or any state or political subdivision thereof, or by the jurisdiction
(or any political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be, is organized, is or should be qualified to do business or maintains its
Lending Office, (ii) any branch profits taxes imposed by the United States of America or any
similar tax imposed by any other jurisdiction described in clause (i) above, (iii) in the
case of a Foreign Lender, any withholding tax that is imposed on amounts payable to such Foreign
Lender at the time such Foreign Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (or designates a new
lending office) or is attributable to such Foreign Lender’s failure to comply with Section
3.01(f), except to the extent that such Foreign Lender (or its assignor, if any) was entitled,
at the time of designation of a new lending office (or assignment), to receive additional amounts
from the Borrower with respect to such withholding tax pursuant to this Section 3.01(a) and
which withholding tax may not be eliminated by complying with Section 3.01(f), and (iv) any
backup withholding tax required to be withheld or paid pursuant to Section 3406 of the Code (all
such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or
similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as “Taxes”). If the Borrower shall
be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan
Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (1) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section), each of the Administrative Agent and such Lender
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (2)
the Borrower shall make such deductions, (3) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (4) within
30 days after the date of such payment, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent
(which shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt
evidencing payment thereof.
     (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp, court or
documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from
39


 

any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement
or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as
“Other Taxes”).
     (c) If the Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in
respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the
Borrower shall also pay to the Administrative Agent (for the account of such Lender) or to such
Lender, at the time interest is paid, such additional amount that such Lender specifies as
necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring in all taxes, including taxes imposed on
or measured by net income) such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had not
been imposed.
     (d) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for (i) the full
amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any
jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent and such
Lender, (ii) amounts payable under Section 3.01(c) and (iii) any liability (including penalties,
interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. Payment under this subsection
(d) shall be made within 30 days after the date the Lender or the Administrative Agent makes a
demand therefor.
     (e) As soon as practicable after any payment of indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the
Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the
original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such
payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
     (f) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax
under the Law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty
to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or
times prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law, or
reasonably requested by Borrower, as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at
a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or
information reporting requirements.
     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is resident
for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior
to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to
time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such
Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
     (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for
benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party;
     (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI;
40


 

     (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for
portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such
Foreign Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a
“10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or
(C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly
completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN; or

     (iv) any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a
reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary
documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower to determine the
withholding or deduction required to be made.

     3.02 Illegality. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any
Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending
Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or materially restricts the authority of
such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the applicable offshore Dollar
market, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice
thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such
Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that
the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice,
the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay
or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on
the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such
Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to
maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall
also pay interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a
different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in
the reasonable judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

     3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. If the Administrative Agent determines in connection with any
request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar
deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore Dollar market for the applicable
amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (b) if the Required
Lenders determine and notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar
Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Eurodollar
Rate Loan, then the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and all Lenders.
Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Eurodollar
Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

     3.04 Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.

     (a) If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that as a result of a Change in Law, or such
Lender’s or L/C Issuer’s compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such
Lender or

41



 

L/C Issuer of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans or
to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining
any Letter of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender or L/C
Issuer in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any
such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which
Section 3.01 shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall
gross income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of
either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender or L/C Issuer is organized or has its Lending
Office, and (iii) reserve requirements contemplated by Section 3.04(c) utilized, as to Eurodollar
Rate Loans, in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate), then from time to time upon demand of
such Lender or L/C Issuer (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower
shall pay to such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amounts as will
compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer for such increased cost or reduction.

     (b) If any Lender determines a Change in Law has the effect of reducing the rate of return on
the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such
Lender’s obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital
adequacy and such Lender’s desired return on capital, then from time to time upon demand of such
Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.

     (c) The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required under
regulations of the Board to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of
or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as “Eurocurrency liabilities”),
additional costs on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual
costs of such reserves allocated to such Revolving Loan by such Lender (as determined by such
Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on
each date on which interest is payable on such Revolving Loan; provided the Borrower shall have
received at least 10 days’ prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such
additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the
relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 days from
receipt of such notice.

     3.05 Funding Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time
to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from
any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:

     (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Revolving Loan other than a
Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Revolving Loan
(whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or

     (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a
Revolving Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Revolving Loan other than a Base Rate
Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; including any loss of anticipated
profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by
it to maintain such Revolving Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such
funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by
such Lender in connection with the foregoing.

42



 

     For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section
3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the
Eurodollar Rate for such Revolving Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the applicable
offshore Dollar interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or
not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

     3.06 Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation. A certificate of the Administrative
Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article III and setting forth the additional
amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
In determining such amount, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods.

     3.07 Survival. All of the Borrower’s obligations under this Article III shall survive termination
of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment and payment in full of all the other Obligations.

     3.08 Mitigation Obligations. If any Lender or L/C Issuer requests compensation under Section
3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, L/C Issuer or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or L/C Issuer, as applicable, pursuant to
Section 3.01, then such Lender or L/C Issuer shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different
Lending Office for funding or booking its Revolving Loans or issuing Letters of Credit hereunder or
to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates,
if, in the judgment of such Lender or L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would
eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.04, as the case may be,
in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender or L/C Issuer to any unreimbursed cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or L/C Issuer. The Borrower
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or L/C Issuer in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions to be terminated, whereupon such Revolving
Commitments and obligations shall be terminated;

66



 

     (b) declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans, all interest
accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any event specified in subsection (f) of Section
8.01, the obligation of each Lender to make Revolving Loans and any obligation of the L/C Issuer to
make L/C Credit Extensions shall automatically terminate, the unpaid principal amount of all
outstanding Revolving Loans and all interest and other amounts as aforesaid shall automatically
become due and payable, and the obligation of the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L/C
Obligations as aforesaid shall automatically become effective, in each case without further act of
the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

ARTICLE IX.
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

     9.01 Appointment and Authorization of Agents; Lender Hedging Agreements. (a) Each Lender and the
L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably (subject to Section 9.10) appoints, designates and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and
each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly
delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall not have
any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the
Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or
participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term “agent” herein and in the other Loan Documents with
reference to the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law.
Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or
reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.

     (b) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit
issued by it and the documents associated therewith until such time (and except for so long) as the
Administrative Agent may agree at the request of the Required Lenders to act for the L/C Issuer
with respect thereto; provided, however, that the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and
immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in this Article IX with respect to any acts
taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or
proposed to be issued by it and the application and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to
the Letters of Credit as fully as if the term “Administrative Agent” as used in this Article IX
included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided
herein with respect to the L/C Issuer.

67



 

     (c) To the extent any Lender or any Affiliate of a Lender is a party to a Lender Hedging
Agreement and accepts the benefits of the Liens in the Collateral arising pursuant to the
Collateral Documents, such Lender (for itself and on behalf of any such Affiliates) shall be deemed
(i) to appoint the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, as its nominee and agent, to act for
and on behalf of such Lender or Affiliate thereof in connection with the Collateral Documents and
(ii) to be bound by the terms of this Article IX.

     9.02 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents (including the Collateral Agent),
employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or
experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the
Collateral Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or
attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     9.03 Default; Collateral. (a) Upon the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of
Default, the Lenders agree to promptly confer in order that Required Lenders or the Lenders, as the
case may be, may agree upon a course of action for the enforcement of the rights of the Lenders;
and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action (without incurring
any liability to any Person for so refraining) unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have
received instructions from Required Lenders. All rights of action under the Loan Documents and all
right to the Collateral, if any, hereunder may be enforced by the Administrative Agent (or the
Collateral Agent) and any suit or proceeding instituted by the Administrative Agent (or the
Collateral Agent) in furtherance of such enforcement shall be brought in its name as the
Administrative Agent (or the Collateral Agent) without the necessity of joining as plaintiffs or
defendants any other Lender, and the recovery of any judgment shall be for the benefit of the
Lenders (and, with respect to Lender Hedging Agreements, Affiliates, if applicable) subject to the
expenses of the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent. In actions with respect to any
property of the Borrower or any other Obligor, the Administrative Agent (and the Collateral Agent)
is acting for the ratable benefit of each Lender (and, with respect to Lender Hedging Agreement,
Affiliates, if applicable).
Any and all agreements to subordinate (whether made heretofore or hereafter) other indebtedness or
obligations of Borrower to the Obligations shall be construed as being for the ratable benefit of
each Lender (and, with respect to Lender Hedging Agreement, Affiliates, if applicable).

     (b) Each Lender authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent to enter
into the Collateral Documents on behalf of and for the benefit of the Lenders (and, with respect to
Lender Hedging Agreements, Affiliates, if applicable)(or if previously entered into, hereby
ratifies the Administrative Agent’s (and the Collateral Agent’s) previously entering into such
agreements and Collateral Documents).

     (c) Except to the extent unanimity (or other percentage set forth in Section 10.1) is required
hereunder, each Lender agrees that any action taken by the Required Lenders in accordance with the
provisions of the Loan Documents, and the exercise by the Required Lenders of the power set forth
herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be
authorized and binding upon all of the Lenders.

     (d) The Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent are each hereby authorized on behalf of the
Lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from any Lender, from time to
time to take any action with respect to any Collateral or Collateral Documents which may be
necessary to

68



 

perfect and maintain perfected the Liens upon the Collateral granted pursuant to the
Collateral Documents.

     (e) Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any obligation
whatsoever to any Lender or to any other Person to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by
any Obligor or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered or that the Liens granted
to the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent herein or pursuant to any Collateral Document
have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, or enforced, or are
entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any
duty of care, disclosure, or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the Rights granted or
available to the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent in this Section 9.03 or in any of the
Collateral Documents; it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act,
omission, or event related thereto, the Administrative Agent may act in any manner it may deem
appropriate, in its sole discretion, given the Administrative Agent’s own interest in the
Collateral as one of the Lenders and that the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or liability
whatsoever to any Lender, other than to act without gross negligence or willful misconduct and the
same shall apply to the Collateral Agent so long as the Administrative Agent is also the Collateral
Agent.

     (f) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent,
at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the Administrative
Agent or Collateral Agent upon any Collateral: (i) constituting property in which no Obligor owned
an interest at the time the Lien was granted or at any time thereafter; (ii) constituting property
leased to an Obligor under a lease which has expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted
under the Loan Document or is about to expire and which has not been, and is not intended by such
Obligor to be, renewed; and (iii) consisting of an instrument evidencing Indebtedness pledged to
the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Lenders), if the Indebtedness
evidenced thereby has been paid in full. In addition, the Lenders irrevocably authorize the
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent to release Liens upon Collateral as contemplated in
Section 10.01(c) or (d), or if approved, authorized, or
ratified in writing by the requisite Lenders. Upon request by the Administrative Agent ((or
the Collateral Agent) at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s
(or the Collateral Agent’s) authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant
to this Section 9.03.

     (g) In furtherance of the authorizations set forth in this Section 9.03, each Lender hereby
irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent its attorney-in-fact, with full
power of substitution, for and on behalf of and in the name of each such Lender (i) to enter into
Collateral Documents (including, without limitation, any appointments of substitute trustees under
any Collateral Documents), (ii) to take action with respect to the Collateral and Collateral
Documents to perfect, maintain, and preserve Lenders’ Liens, and (iii) to execute instruments of
release or to take other action necessary to release Liens upon any Collateral to the extent
authorized in paragraph (f) hereof. This power of attorney shall be liberally, not restrictively,
construed so as to give the greatest latitude to the Administrative Agent’s and Collateral Agent’s
power, as attorney, relative to the Collateral matters described in this Section 9.03. The powers
and authorities herein conferred on the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent may be exercised
by the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent through any Person who, at the time of the
execution of a particular instrument, is an officer of the Administrative Agent (or any Person
acting on behalf of the Administrative Agent pursuant to a valid power of attorney) or is an
officer of the Collateral Agent (or any Person acting on behalf of the Collateral Agent pursuant to
a valid power of attorney). The power of attorney conferred by this Section 9.03(g) to the
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent is granted for valuable consideration and is coupled with
an interest and is

69



 

irrevocable so long as the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall remain unpaid
or the Lenders are obligated to make any Borrowings under the Loan Documents.

     9.04 Liability of Agents. No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any
manner to any Lender or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by
any Loan Party or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by
Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, or for the creation, perfection or priority of any Liens purported to be created by
any of the Loan Documents, or the validity, genuineness, enforceability, existence, value or
sufficiency of any collateral security, or to make any inquiry respecting the performance by the
Borrower of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any
Loan Party or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant to
ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in,
or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or
records of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof.

     9.05 Reliance by Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution,
representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, facsimile, telex or telephone
message, statement or other document or conversation reasonably believed
by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or
Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party),
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any Loan Document
unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems
appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking
or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders or all the Lenders, if required
hereunder, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding upon all the Lenders and participants. Where this Agreement expressly permits or prohibits
an action unless the Required Lenders otherwise determine, the Administrative Agent shall, and in
all other instances, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, initiate any
solicitation for the consent or a vote of the Lenders.

     (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 4.01,
each Lender that has funded its Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing(s) on the Second Amended and
Restated Closing Date (or, if there is no Borrowing made on such date, each Lender other than
Lenders who gave written objection to the Administrative Agent prior to such date) shall be deemed
to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter
either sent by the Administrative Agent to such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance or
satisfaction, or required hereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory
to a Lender.

70



 

     9.06 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the
payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a
Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders
of its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default or Event of Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with
Article VIII; provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative Agent has received any
such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem
advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

     9.07 Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Administrative Agent. Each Lender acknowledges
that no Agent-Related Person has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the
Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment
or review of the affairs of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute
any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter,
including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information in their possession.
Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance
upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to
extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently
and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as
it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and
decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to
make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the
other Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be
furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or
creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come
into the possession of any Agent Related Person.

     9.08 Indemnification of Agents. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not
reimbursed by or on behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan Party
to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the
payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from
such Person’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that no action taken in
accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross
negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the
foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its
ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal

71



 

proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under,
this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to
the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the
Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive termination of the Revolving Commitments,
the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of the Administrative
Agent.

     9.09 Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. Royal Bank and its Affiliates may make loans
to, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking,
trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with each of the Loan Parties and their
respective Affiliates as though Royal Bank were not the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or
the L/C Issuer hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge
that, pursuant to such activities, Royal Bank or its Affiliates may receive information regarding
any Loan Party or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality
obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative
Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its
Revolving Loans, Royal Bank shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other
Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not the Administrative Agent,
Collateral Agent or the L/C Issuer, and the terms “Lender” and “Lenders” include Royal Bank in its
individual capacity.

     9.10 Successor Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign
as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent upon 30 days’ notice to the Lenders with a copy of
such notice to the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the
Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative agent and
collateral agent for the Lenders which successor administrative agent and collateral agent shall be
consented to by the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default
(which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor
administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and
the Borrower, a successor administrative agent from among the Lenders, who shall also succeed to
the role of collateral agent. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative
agent hereunder, such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term “Administrative Agent” shall mean such
successor administrative agent and the retiring Administrative Agent’s appointment, powers and
duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Administrative Agent’s
resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article IX and Sections 10.04
and 10.13 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has accepted
appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring
Administrative Agent’s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation shall
nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

     9.11 Other Agents; Arrangers. None of the Lenders or other Persons identified on the facing page or signature pages of this
Agreement as a “syndication agent,” as a “documentation agent,” any other type of agent (other than
the Administrative Agent), “arranger,” or “bookrunner” shall have any right, power, obligation,
liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders
as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders so identified shall have or be deemed
to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not

72



 

relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders so identified in deciding to enter into this
Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

     9.12 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any
receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,
composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent
(irrespective of whether the principal of any Revolving Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due
and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered,
by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise

     (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and
unpaid in respect of the Revolving Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing
and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the
claims of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and
the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the
Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.13(i) and (j), 2.07 10.04 and
10.05) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

     (ii) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such
claims and to distribute the same; 

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official
in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and the L/C Issuer to make such
payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent
to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, to pay to the
Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07, 10.04 and 10.05.

     Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or
consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or the L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to
authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.

ARTICLE X.
MISCELLANEOUS

     10.01 Amendments, Release of Collateral, Etc.

     (a) No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and
no consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective
unless in writing signed by the Required Lenders and the Borrower or the applicable Loan Party, as
the case may be, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given;
provided, however, that no such amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by
each of the

73



 

Lenders directly affected thereby and by the Borrower, and acknowledged by the Administrative
Agent, do any of the following:

     (i) extend or increase the Revolving Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate any
Revolving Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 8.02);

     (ii) postpone or delay any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for
any payment or mandatory prepayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the
Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under any other Loan Document;

     (iii) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on, any
Revolving Loan or L/C Borrowing or (subject to clause (ii) of the proviso below) any fees or
other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document; provided, however, that
only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary (A) to amend the definition of
“Default Rate” or to waive any obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at the Default
Rate or (B) to amend any financial covenant hereunder (or any defined term used therein)
even if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any
Revolving Loan or L/C Borrowing or to reduce any fee payable hereunder;

     (iv) change the percentage of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment or of the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations which is required for the
Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder;

     (v) change the Pro Rata Share of any Lender;

     (vi) release more than $5,000,000 worth of Collateral or release any Guarantor from a
Guaranty (except in connection with a Disposition permitted under Section 7.07 or as
otherwise permitted under this Section 10.01); or

     (vii) amend this Section, or Section 2.11, or any provision herein providing for
unanimous consent or other action by all the Lenders;

and, provided further: (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by
the L/C Issuer in addition to the Required Lenders or all the Lenders, as the case may be, and the
Administrative Agent, affect the rights or duties of the L/C Issuer under this Agreement or any
Letter of Credit Application relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it; (ii) no
amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in
addition to the Required Lenders or all the Lenders, as the case may be, affect the rights or
duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and (iii) the
Agent/Arranger Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing
executed only by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Lender
that has failed to fund any portion of the Revolving Loans or participation in L/C Obligations
required to be funded by it hereunder shall not have any right to approve or disapprove any
amendment, waiver or consent hereunder, except that the Pro Rata Share of such Lender may not be
increased without the consent of such Lender.

     (b) Any amendment to any Loan Document which purports to (i) decrease the amount of any
mandatory prepayment or commitment reduction required by Section 2.03 or (ii) change this Section

74



 

10.01(b), must be by an instrument in writing executed by Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
and the Required Lenders.

     (c) Upon any sale, transfer or Disposition of Collateral which is permitted pursuant to the
Loan Documents, and upon 10 Business Days’ prior written request by the Borrower (which request
must be accompanied by (i) true and correct copies of all material documents of transfer or
Disposition, including any contract of sale, (ii) a preliminary closing statement and instructions
to the title company, if any, (iii) all requested release instruments in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and (iv) if required, written consent of the requisite
Lenders), the Administrative Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to)
execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of Liens granted to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders pursuant hereto in such Collateral. The
Administrative Agent shall not be required to execute any release instruments on terms which, in
the Administrative Agent’s opinion, would expose the Administrative Agent to liability or create
any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of Liens without recourse or
warranty. No such release shall impair the Administrative Agent’s Lien on the proceeds of sale of
such Collateral.

     (d) If all outstanding Revolving Loans and other Obligations (other than contingent indemnity
obligations) have been indefeasibly paid in full (or, with respect to L/C Obligations, Cash
Collateralized) and the Revolving Commitments have terminated or have been reduced to zero, and,
subject to Section 10.01(e) all Lender Hedging Agreement have terminated, the Administrative Agent
agrees to, and the Lenders hereby instruct the Administrative Agent to, at the Borrower’s expense,
execute and authorize such releases of the Collateral Documents as the Borrower shall reasonably
request and this Agreement shall be deemed terminated except that such termination shall not
relieve the Borrower of any obligation to make any payments to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender required by any Loan Document to the extent accruing, or relating to an event occurring,
prior to such termination.

     (e) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if the Revolving Commitments have
been terminated, and the only outstanding Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations
and L/C Obligations that are Cash Collateralized) are amounts owed pursuant to one or more Lender
Hedging Agreements, the Administrative Agent will, and is hereby authorized to, (A) release the
Liens created under the Loan Documents and (B) release all Guaranties of the Borrower; provided,
that contemporaneously with such release, (i) the Borrower (and, if applicable, the Subsidiary that
is a party to such Lender Hedging Agreements) (A) executes a margin agreement in form and substance
acceptable to such Lender(s) (or its Affiliates) that are parties to such Lender Hedging Agreements
(the “Lender Counterparties”) and (B), if required, provides collateral in the form of cash or a
letter of credit having an aggregate value acceptable to such Lender Counterparties, and (ii) if
such Lender Hedging Agreement is executed by a Subsidiary of the Borrower and the Borrower is not a
party thereto, the Borrower executes a guaranty covering such Subsidiary’s obligations thereunder,
such guaranty to be in form and substance satisfactory to the Lender Counterparties. Any release
under this Section 10.01(e) must be in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent.

     10.02 Notices and Other Communications; Facsimile Copies.

     (a) General. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices and other
communications provided for hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be in writing
(including by facsimile transmission) and mailed, faxed or delivered, to the address, facsimile
number or

75



 

(subject to subsection (c) below) electronic mail address specified for notices on Schedule
10.02 (for the Borrower, any Guarantor and the Administrative Agent) or on the Administrative
Details Form (for the other Lenders); or, in the case of the Borrower, the Guarantors, the
Administrative Agent, or the L/C Issuer, to such other address as shall be designated by such party
in a notice to the other parties, and in the case of any other party, to such other address as
shall be designated by such party in a notice to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the L/C
Issuer. All such notices and other communications shall be deemed to be given or made upon the
earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt by the intended recipient and (ii) (A) if delivered by hand
or by courier, when signed for by the intended recipient; (B) if delivered by mail, five (5)
Business Days after deposit in the mails, postage prepaid; (C) if delivered by facsimile, when sent
and receipt has been confirmed by telephone; and (D) if delivered by electronic mail (which form of
delivery is subject to the provisions of subsection (c) below), when delivered; provided, however,
that notices and other communications to the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer pursuant to
Article II shall not be effective until actually received by such Person. Any notice or other
communication permitted to be given, made or confirmed by telephone hereunder shall be given, made
or confirmed by means of a telephone call to the intended recipient at the number specified in
accordance with this Section, it being understood and agreed that a voicemail message shall in no
event be effective as a notice, communication or confirmation hereunder.

     (b) Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan Documents may be
transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of any such documents and signatures
shall, subject to applicable Law, have the same force and effect as manually-signed originals and
shall be binding on all Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative
Agent may also require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed
original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not
limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.

     (c) Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Electronic mail and internet and intranet
websites may be used only to distribute routine communications, such as financial statements and
other information, and to distribute Loan Documents for execution by the parties thereto, and shall
not be recognized hereunder for any other purpose.

     (d) Reliance by Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and Lenders. The Administrative
Agent, L/C Issuer and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including
telephonic Borrowing Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such
notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or
followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by
the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify each
Agent-Related Person and each Lender from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting
from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower.
All telephonic notices to and other communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by
the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.

     10.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and

76



 

privileges herein or therein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights,
remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law.

     10.04 Attorney Costs; Expenses and Taxes. The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the
Arranger, the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent for all costs and expenses associated with
the due diligence and background investigation undertaken in connection with this Agreement and
incurred in connection with the development, preparation, negotiation, syndication, administration
and execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including the filing, recording,
refiling or rerecording of any pledge agreement and any Security Agreement and/or any UCC financing
statements relating thereto and all amendments, supplements and modifications to any thereof and
any and all other documents or instruments of further assurance required to be filed or recorded or
refiled or rerecorded by the terms hereof or of any mortgage, any pledge agreement or any security
agreement, and any amendment, waiver, consent or other modification of the provisions hereof and
thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are consummated), and the
consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including all
Attorney Costs, and (b) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and each
Lender for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement, attempted
enforcement, or preservation of any rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents (including all such costs and expenses incurred during any workout or restructuring in
respect of the Obligations and during any legal proceeding, including any proceeding under any
Debtor Relief Law), including all Attorney Costs. The foregoing costs and expenses shall include
all search, filing, recording, title insurance and appraisal charges and fees and taxes related
thereto, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent
and the cost of independent public accountants and other outside experts retained by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender. The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination
of the Revolving Commitments and repayment of all the other Obligations.

     10.05 Indemnification. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the
Borrower and each Guarantor (by execution of a Guaranty), jointly and severally, agrees to
indemnify, save and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person, the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Arranger, each Lender, the L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (collectively the
“Indemnitees”) from and against: (a) any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action that
are asserted against any Indemnitee by any Person (other than the Administrative Agent or any
Lender) relating directly or indirectly to a claim, demand, action or cause of action that such
Person asserts or may assert against any Loan Party, any Affiliate of any Loan Party or any of
their respective officers or directors, arising out of or relating to, the Loan Documents, the
Revolving Commitments, the use or contemplated use of the proceeds of any Revolving Loans, or the
relationship of any Loan Party, the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the
Lenders and the L/C Issuer under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (b) any and all claims,
demands, actions or causes of action that may at any time (including at any time following
repayment of the Obligations and the resignation of the Administrative Agent or the replacement of
any Lender) be asserted or imposed against any Indemnitee by any Person or by the Borrower or any
other Loan Party, arising out of or relating to, the Loan Documents, the Revolving Commitments, the
use or contemplated use of the proceeds of any Revolving Loans, or the relationship of any Loan
Party, the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (c) without limiting the foregoing, any and all
claims, demands, actions or causes
of action, judgments and orders, penalties and fines that are asserted or imposed against any
Indemnitee, (i) under the application of any Environmental Law applicable to the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets, including the treatment or disposal

77



 

of Hazardous Substances on any of their properties or assets, (ii) as a result of the breach
or non-compliance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary with any Environmental Law applicable to the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, (iii) due to past ownership by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any of
their properties or assets or past activity on any of their properties or assets which, though
lawful and fully permissible at the time, could result in present liability, (iv) due to the
presence, use, storage, treatment or disposal of Hazardous Substances on or under, or the escape,
seepage, leakage, spillage, discharge, emission or Release from, any of the properties owned or
operated by the Borrower or any Subsidiary (including any liability asserted or arising under any
Environmental Law), regardless of whether caused by, or within the control of, the Borrower or such
Subsidiary, or (v) due to any other environmental, health or safety condition in connection with
the Loan Documents; (d) any administrative or investigative proceeding by any Governmental
Authority arising out of or related to a claim, demand, action or cause of action described in
subsection (a), (b) or (c) above; and (e) any and all liabilities (including liabilities under
indemnities), losses, costs, damages or expenses (including Attorney Costs and settlement costs)
that any Indemnitee suffers or incurs as a result of the assertion of any foregoing claim, demand,
action, cause of action or proceeding, or as a result of the preparation of any defense in
connection with any foregoing claim, demand, action, cause of action or proceeding, in all cases,
WHETHER OR NOT ARISING OUT OF THE STRICT LIABILITY OR NEGLIGENCE OF AN INDEMNITEE, and whether or
not an Indemnitee is a party to such claim, demand, action, cause of action or proceeding (all the
foregoing, collectively, the “Indemnified Liabilities”); provided that such indemnity shall not, as
to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such liabilities, losses, costs, damages or
expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment
to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. The
agreements in this Section shall survive and continue for the benefit of the Indemnitees at all
times after the Borrower’s acceptance of the Lenders’ Revolving Commitments under this Agreement,
whether or not the Second Amended and Restated Closing Date shall occur and shall survive the
termination of the Revolving Commitments and repayment of all the other Obligations.

     10.06 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that the Borrower makes a payment to the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and
such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any
settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid
to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor
Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof
originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if
such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so
recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such
demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from
time to time in effect.

     10.07 Successors and Assigns.

     (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without
the prior written consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations hereunder
except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this
Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this
Section or (iii) by way

78



 

of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of paragraph (f) of
this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and
void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any
Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby,
Participants to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

     (b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving
Commitment and the Revolving Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations
in L/C Obligations) at the time owing to it); provided that:

except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s
Revolving Commitment and the Revolving Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an
assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender,
the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitment (which for this purpose includes Revolving Loans
outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Revolving Commitment is not then in effect, the
outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such
assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment
is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and
Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $1,000,000, unless each of the
Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower otherwise consent (Borrower’s consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed);

     (i) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of
all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the
Revolving Loans and/or the Revolving Commitment assigned; and

     (ii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent an Assignment and Assumption, the assigning Lender or the assignee shall pay the
Administrative Agent a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which the Administrative
Agent may waive or reduce in its sole discretion), and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall
not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Details Form.

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (c)
of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the
Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations
under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.07, 10.04 and 10.05 with respect to facts and circumstances
occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender
of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be
treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights
and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section.

79



 

     (c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the
Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered
to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Revolving Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations owing
to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms
hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     (d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural
person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”)
in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all
or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and/or the Revolving Loans (including such Lender’s
participation in L/C Obligations) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement
or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender
shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide
that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver that would (i) postpone any date upon which any payment of money is
scheduled to be paid to such Participant, (ii) reduce the principal, interest, fees or other
amounts payable to such Participant, or (iii) extend the Maturity Date. Subject to subsection (e)
of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by Law,
each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as though it were a
Lender; provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.11 and Section 3.08 as though
it were a Lender.

     (e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or
3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is
made with the Borrower’s prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it
were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Borrower is notified
of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the
Borrower, to comply with Section 3.01 as though it were a Lender.

     (f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement (including under its Revolver Note, if any) to secure obligations
of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release a Lender from any of its obligations
hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

     (g) If the consent of the Borrower to an assignment or to an Eligible Assignee is required
hereunder (including a consent to an assignment which does not meet the minimum assignment
threshold

80



 

specified in clause (i) of the proviso to the first sentence of Section 10.07(b)), the
Borrower shall be deemed to have given its consent five Business Days after the date notice thereof
has been delivered by the assigning Lender (through the Administrative Agent) unless such consent
is expressly refused by the Borrower prior to such fifth Business Day.

     (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Royal Bank
assigns all of its Revolving Commitment and Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Royal
Bank may, (i) upon 30 days’ notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer. In the
event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among
the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to
appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Royal Bank as L/C Issuer. Royal Bank
shall retain all the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters
of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C
Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate
Loans or fund participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.13(c)).

     10.08 Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees that it will not disclose without the prior consent of
the Borrower (other than to directors, officers, employees, auditors, accountants, counsel or other
professional advisors of the Administrative Agent or any Lender) any information with respect to
the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, which is furnished pursuant to this Agreement and which (i) the
Borrower in good faith considers to be confidential and (ii) is either clearly marked confidential
or is designated by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in writing as
confidential; provided that any Lender may disclose any such information (a) as has become
generally available to the public, (b) as may be required or appropriate in any report, statement
or testimony submitted to or required by any municipal, state or federal regulatory body having or
claiming to have jurisdiction over such Lender or submitted to or required by the Board or the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or similar organizations (whether in the United States or
elsewhere) or their successors, (c) as may be required or appropriate in response to any summons or
subpoena in connection with any litigation, (d) in order to comply with any Law, order, regulation
or ruling applicable to such Lender, (e) to any Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, or any
prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement; provided that such Eligible Assignee or Participant or prospective Eligible Assignee or
Participant executes an agreement containing provisions substantially similar to those contained in
this Section 10.08, (f) in connection with the exercise of any remedy by such Lender following an
Event of Default pertaining to the Loan Documents, (g) in connection with any litigation involving
such Lender pertaining to the Loan Documents, (h) to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, or (i)
to any Affiliate of any Lender (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is
made will be informed of the confidential nature of such information and obligated to keep such
information confidential).

     10.09 Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is authorized at any
time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower or any other Loan Party, any such
notice being waived by the Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Loan Party) to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing
by, such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and
all Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, now or hereafter existing,
irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such
Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such
Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly

81



 

to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application
made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application.

     10.10 Interest Rate Limitation. Regardless of any provision contained in any Loan Document,
neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall ever be entitled to contract for, charge,
take, reserve, receive, or apply, as interest on all or any part of the Obligations, any amount in
excess of the Maximum Rate, and, if any Lender ever does so, then such excess shall be deemed a
partial prepayment of principal and treated hereunder as such and any remaining excess shall be
refunded to the Borrower. In determining if the interest paid or payable exceeds the Maximum Rate,
the Borrower and the Lenders shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable Law, (a) treat
all Borrowings as but a single extension of credit (and the Lenders and the Borrower agree that
such is the case and that provision herein for multiple Borrowings is for convenience only), (b)
characterize any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee, or premium rather than as interest, (c)
exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (d) amortize, prorate, allocate, and
spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the Obligations.
However, if the Obligations are paid and performed in full prior to the end of the full
contemplated term thereof, and if the interest received for the actual period of existence thereof
exceeds the Maximum Amount, the Lenders shall refund such excess, and, in such event, the Lenders
shall not, to the extent permitted by Law, be subject to any penalties provided by any Laws for
contracting for, charging, taking, reserving or receiving interest in excess of the Maximum Amount.
To the extent the Laws of the State of Texas are applicable for purposes of determining the
“Maximum Rate” or the “Maximum Amount,” then those terms mean the “weekly ceiling” from time to
time in effect under Texas Finance Code § 303.001, as limited by Texas Finance Code § 303.009. The
Borrower agrees that Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended (which regulates certain
revolving credit loan accounts and revolving tri-party accounts), does not apply to the
Obligations.

     10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

     10.12 Integration. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete
and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all
prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between
the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this
Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of
the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict
with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective
parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in
accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

     10.13 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made
hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or
in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.
Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent
and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or
on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice
or knowledge of any
Default or Event of Default at the time of any Borrowing, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as any Revolving Loan or any other Obligation shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied.

82



 

     10.14 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to
which the Borrower is a party that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

     10.15 Replacement of Lenders. If (i) any Lender fails or refuses to consent to any requested
amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 10.01 and the Required Lenders have approved such requested
amendment or waiver, (ii) any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if the Borrower
is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the
account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, (iii) any Lender is in breach of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or (iv) if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the
Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole
expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to
assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained
in, and consents required by, Section 10.07), all of its interests, rights and obligations under
this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such
obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided
that:

     (a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in
Section 10.07(b)(iii);

     (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of
its Revolving Loans, L/C Advances, L/C Borrowings, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all
other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts
under Section 3.05 as though such replacement were a repayment and not as assignment) from the
assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the
Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) such payment being at par, with no premium or discount;

     (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section
3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a
reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and

     (d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.

     A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as
a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to
require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

10.16 Governing Law.

     (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF TEXAS APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE;

     10.17 Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury, Etc. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH GUARANTOR, BY
EXECUTION OF A GUARANTY, HEREBY (a) EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF
ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY
CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY

SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PARTY AGAINST WHOM DAMAGES ARE SOUGHT HAS ENGAGED IN GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

     10.18 Termination of Commitments Under First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of
the Second Amended and Restated Closing Date, the aggregate commitments under the First Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement are terminated and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby waive
any right to receive prior notice of such termination. Each Lender agrees upon the Second Amended

     10.19 No Novations, Etc. To the extent of the aggregate commitment outstanding under the
First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ($25,000,000), nothing contained herein shall be deemed
a novation of or a repayment or new advance of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder. Only to
the extent of an increase in the Aggregate Revolving Commitment over that amount shall there be
deemed to be a new advance by the Lenders to the Borrower under this Agreement. The Indebtedness
owing under the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is renewed, rearranged, extended and
carried forward by this Agreement and all of the liens and security interests securing the
“Obligations” as defined in the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are carried forward and

BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR
SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE
PARTIES.

GUARANTY PROVISIONS
     SECTION 2.1 Guaranty. Each Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally, and
irrevocably (1) guarantees the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by
required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all Obligations of the
Borrower and each other Obligor now or hereafter existing under each of the Second Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement, the Notes and each other Loan Document to which the Borrower or such
other Obligor is or may become a party, whether for principal, interest, fees, expenses or
otherwise (including all such amounts which would become due but for the operation of the automatic
stay under Section 362(a) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §362(a), and the
operation of Sections 502(b) and 506(b) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §502(b) and
§506(b)), and (2) indemnifies and holds harmless each Lender and each holder of a Note for any and
all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses) incurred by such Lender
or such holder, as the case may be, in enforcing any rights under this Guaranty; provided however,
that each Guarantor shall be liable under this Guaranty for the maximum amount of such liability
that can be hereby incurred without rendering this Guaranty, as it relates to such Guarantor,
voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent
3


 

transfer, and not for any greater amount. This Guaranty constitutes a guaranty of payment when
due and not of collection, and each Guarantor specifically agrees that it shall not be necessary or
required that any Lender or any holder of any Note exercise any right, assert any claim or demand
or enforce any remedy whatsoever against the Borrower or any other Obligor (or any other Person)
before or as a condition to the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.
     SECTION 2.2 Acceleration of Guaranty. Each Guarantor agrees that, in the event of the
occurrence of any event of the type described in Section 8.01(f) or Section 8.01(g) of the Second
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with respect to the Borrower, any other Obligor or any other
Guarantor, and if such event shall occur at a time when any of the Obligations may not then be due
and payable, such Guarantor will pay to the Lenders forthwith the full amount which would be
payable hereunder by such Guarantor if all such Obligations were then due and payable.
     SECTION 2.3 Guaranty Absolute, etc. This Guaranty shall in all respects be a
continuing, absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guaranty of payment, and shall remain in full
force and effect until all Obligations of the Borrower and each other Obligor have been paid in
full, all obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall have been paid in full, all Commitments
shall have terminated and, except as provided in Section 10.01(e) of the Second Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement, all Lender Hedging Agreements have terminated. No Guarantor may rescind
or revoke its obligations hereunder. Each Guarantor guarantees that the Obligations of the Borrower
and each other Obligor will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Second Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement and each other Loan Document and each Lender Hedging Agreement under
which they arise, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any
jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of any Lender or any holder of any Note with
respect thereto. The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable irrespective of: (1) any lack of validity, legality or enforceability
of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document or any
Lender Hedging Agreement; (2) the failure of any Lender or any holder of any Note (a) to assert any
claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Borrower, any other Obligor or any
other Person (including any other guarantor) under the provisions of the Second Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement, any Note, any other Loan Document, any Lender Hedging Agreement or
otherwise, or (b) to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of, or collateral
securing, any Obligations of the Borrower or any other Obligor; (3) any change in the time, manner
or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations of the Borrower or
any other Obligor, or any other extension, compromise or renewal of any Obligations of the Borrower
or any other Obligor; (4) any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination of any Obligations
of the Borrower or any other Obligor for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release,
surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to (and each Guarantor hereby waives
any right to or claim of) any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever
by reason of the invalidity, illegality, nongenuineness, irregularity, compromise, unenforceability
of, or any other event or occurrence affecting, any Obligations of the Borrower, any other Obligor
or otherwise; (5) any amendment to, rescission, waiver, or other modification of, or any consent to
departure from, any of the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, any Note or
any other Loan Document or any Lender Hedging Agreement; (6) any addition, exchange, release,
surrender or non-perfection of any collateral, or any amendment to or waiver or release or addition
of, or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, held by any Lender or any holder of any Note
securing any of the Obligations of the Borrower or any other Obligor; (7) the insolvency or
bankruptcy of, or similar event affecting, the Borrower or any other Obligor; or (8) any other
circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a legal or equitable
discharge of, the Borrower, any other Obligor, any surety or any guarantor. Each Guarantor
4


 

waives all rights and defenses which may arise with respect to any of the foregoing, and each
Guarantor waives any right to revoke this Guaranty with respect to future indebtedness. Each
Guarantor waives all rights or defenses under (1) Section 34.01 et seq. of the
Texas Business and Commerce Code, as amended, (2) Section 17.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and
Remedies Code, as amended, (3) Rule 31 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, or (4)
common law, in equity, under contract, by statute, or otherwise.
     SECTION 2.4 Reinstatement. Each Guarantor agrees that this Guaranty shall continue to
be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment (in whole or in part)
of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Lender or any holder of
any Note, upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, any other Obligor or
otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

     SECTION 2.5 Waiver, etc. The Guarantors hereby waive promptness, diligence, notice
of acceptance and any other notice with respect to any of the Obligations of the Borrower or any
other Obligor and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Administrative Agent, any other Lender
or any holder of any Note protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or Lien, or any
property subject thereto, or exhaust any right or take any action against the Borrower, any other
Obligor or any other Person (including any other guarantor) or entity or any collateral securing
the Obligations of the Borrower or any other Obligor, as the case may be.
     SECTION 2.6 Waiver of Subrogation. Until the Obligations are paid in full, all
Commitments have terminated and all Lender Hedging Agreements have terminated, the Guarantors shall
not enforce or exercise any claim or other rights which they may now or hereafter acquire against
the Borrower or any other Obligor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or
enforcement of any Guarantor’s obligations under this Guaranty or any other Loan Document,
including any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, or indemnification, any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of the Lenders against the Borrower or any other Obligor or any
collateral which the Administrative Agent now has or hereafter acquires, whether or not such claim,
remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law, including the right to
take or receive from the Borrower or any other Obligor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other
property or by set-off or in any manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other
rights. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence, such
amount shall be deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust
for, the Lenders, and shall forthwith be paid to the Lenders by the Guarantor receiving such
payment to be credited and applied upon the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. Each
Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing
arrangements contemplated by the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and that the waiver
set forth in this Section is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
     SECTION 2.7 Payments Free and Clear of Taxes, etc. Each Guarantor hereby agrees
that:
     (a) All payments by such Guarantor hereunder shall be made in accordance with Section 3.01 of
the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement free and clear of and without deduction for any
and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees,
withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto; excluding, in the case
of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, (i) taxes imposed on or measured by its net income,
and franchise taxes (including the Texas franchise tax) imposed on it (in lieu of net income
taxes), by the United States or any state or political subdivision thereof, or by the jurisdiction
(or any political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of
5


 

which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is organized, is or should
be qualified to do business or maintains its Lending Office, (ii) any branch profits taxes imposed
by the United States or any similar tax imposed by any other jurisdiction described in clause
(i) above, (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender, any withholding tax that is imposed on
amounts payable to such Foreign Lender at the time such Foreign Lender becomes a party to the
Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (or designates a new lending office) or is
attributable to such Foreign Lender’s failure to comply with Section 3.01(f) of the Second
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, except to the extent that such Foreign Lender (or its
assignor, if any) was entitled, at the time of designation of a new lending office (or assignment),
to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such withholding tax pursuant to
Section 3.01(a) of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and which withholding
tax may not be eliminated by complying with Section 3.01(f) of the Second Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement, and (iv) any backup withholding tax required to be withheld or paid
pursuant to Section 3406 of the Code (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts,
deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter
referred to as “Taxes”). If such Guarantor shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from
or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender,
(1) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), each of the
Administrative Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
no such deductions been made, (2) such Guarantor shall make such deductions, (3) such Guarantor
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable Laws, and (4) within 30 days after the date of such payment, such
Guarantor shall furnish to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
evidencing payment thereof.
     (b) If a Guarantor fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or
fails to remit to any Lender the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, such
Guarantor shall indemnify such Lender for any incremental Taxes, interest or penalties that may
become payable by such Lender as a result of any such failure.

     (c) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Guarantors hereunder, the
agreements and obligations of the Guarantors contained in this Section 2.7 shall survive the
payment in full of the principal of and interest on the Loans.
     SECTION 2.8 Contribution Agreement. Upon full and final payment of the Obligations,
each Guarantor and all other Subsidiary Guarantors which have made payments upon all or any part of
the Obligations shall be entitled to contribution from all of the other Guarantors and Subsidiary
Guarantors, to the end that all such payments upon the Obligations shall be shared among all
Guarantors and Subsidiary Guarantors who guaranteed such Obligations in proportion to their
respective Net Worths (defined below); provided that the contribution obligations of each of the
Guarantors and Subsidiary Guarantors shall be limited to the maximum amount that it can pay at such
time without rendering its contribution obligations voidable under applicable law relating to
fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers. As used in this subsection, the “Net Worth” of each
of the Guarantors and Subsidiary Guarantors means, at any time, the remainder of (i) the fair value
of such Guarantor’s assets (other than such right of contribution), minus (ii) the fair value of
such Guarantor’s liabilities (other than its liabilities under its guaranty of the Obligations).
     SECTION 2.9 Subordination. Each Guarantor hereby subordinates and makes inferior to
the Obligations any and all indebtedness now or at any time hereafter owed by the Borrower or other Obligor
6


 

to such Guarantor. Each Guarantor agrees that after the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, it will not permit the Borrower to
repay such indebtedness or any part thereof and it will not accept payment from the Borrower of
such indebtedness or any part thereof without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders. If
a Guarantor receives any such payment without the prior required written consent, the amount so
paid shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Lenders, shall be segregated from the other
funds of such Guarantor, and shall forthwith be paid over to the Administrative Agent to be held by
the Administrative Agent as collateral for, or then or at any time thereafter applied in whole or
in part by the Administrative Agent against, all or any portions of the Obligations, whether
matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent shall elect.
ARTICLE III
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTEES AND COVENANTS
     SECTION 3.1 Representations, Warranties and Covenants. By execution hereof, each
Guarantor covenants and agrees that the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.01,
5.02, 5.03, 5.04, 5.06, 5.07, 5.08, 5.15, 5.18 and 5.23 of the Second Amended and Restated Credit

covenants and agrees that the terms, covenants, and conditions set forth in Sections 10.05, 10.16
and 10.17 of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are applicable to such Guarantor and

Restated Credit Agreement, no Lender Hedging Agreements are outstanding, the Administrative Agent
shall, at the request and expense of the Guarantors following such termination, promptly execute
and deliver to the Guarantors such documents and instruments as the Guarantors shall reasonably

vis-a-vis each other may be subject to one or more separate agreements between those parties.
However, the Guarantors are not required to inquire about any such agreement and are not subject to
any terms of it unless the Guarantors specifically enter into such agreement. Therefore, neither

(“Debtor”), whose address is 5075 Westheimer, Suite 890, Houston, Texas 77056, for the benefit of
ROYAL BANK OF CANADA (in its capacity as “Administrative Agent” and “Collateral Agent” for the
Lenders (hereafter defined)), as “Secured Party,” whose address is Royal Bank Plaza, P.O. Box 50,
200 Bay Street, 12th Floor, South Tower, Toronto, Ontario M5J 2W7.

RECITALS

     WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of July 11, 2005 (as amended,
supplemented and restated, the “Original Credit Agreement”), among Debtor, as Borrower, the various
financial institutions that are, or may from time to time become, parties thereto (individually a
"Lender” and collectively the “Lenders”) and Royal Bank of Canada, as administrative agent (in such
capacity, the “Administrative Agent”), and collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Collateral
Agent”), the Lenders agreed to make Loans for the account of the Debtor;

     WHEREAS, the Original Credit Agreement was amended and restated in its entirety by an Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement dated January 18, 2006 among Debtor, as Borrower, Royal Bank of
Canada, individually and as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the Lenders party
thereto (as amended, supplemented and restated, the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”);

     WHEREAS, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement was amended and restated in its entirety by
a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement of even date herewith among Debtor, as Borrower,

Lenders party thereto, providing for an aggregate credit facility of $62,000,000 (as the same may

action prohibited by this Security Agreement or by the terms incorporated in this Security
Agreement.

     5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Debtor represents and warrants to Secured Party that:

     (a) Credit Agreement. Certain representations and warranties in the Credit
Agreement are applicable to the Debtor or its assets or operations, and each such
representation and warranty is true and correct,

     (b) Binding Obligation/Perfection. This Security Agreement creates a legal,
valid, and binding Lien in and to the Collateral in favor of Secured Party and enforceable
against Debtor. For Collateral in which the Security Interest may be perfected by the filing
of Financing Statements pursuant to Article 9 of the UCC, once those Financing Statements
have been properly filed in the jurisdictions described on Annex A hereto, the Security
Interest in that Collateral will be fully perfected and the Security Interest will
constitute a first-priority Lien on such Collateral, subject only to Permitted Liens. With
respect to Collateral consisting of investment property (other than Pledged Securities
covered by Paragraph 5(j)), Deposit Accounts (limited to those maintained by Debtor with
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. described on
Annex B-1), electronic chattel paper, letter-of-credit
rights, and instruments, upon the delivery of such Collateral to Secured Party or delivery
of an executed Control Agreement with respect to such Collateral, the Security Interest in
that Collateral will be fully perfected and the Security Interest will constitute a
first-priority Lien on such Collateral, subject only to Permitted Liens. None of the
Collateral has been delivered nor control with respect thereto given to any Person other
than the Administrative Agent. Other than the Financing Statements and Control Agreements
with respect to this Security Agreement, there are no other financing statements or

Allis-Chalmers Energy
Amended & Restated Pledge
and Security Agreement

6



 

control agreements covering any Collateral, other than those evidencing Permitted
Liens. The creation of the Security Interest does not require the consent of any Person that
has not been obtained.

     (c) Debtor Information. Debtor’s exact legal name, mailing address,
jurisdiction of organization, type of entity, and state issued organizational identification
number are as set forth on Annex A hereto.

     (d) Location. Debtor’s place of business and chief executive office is where
Debtor is entitled to receive notices hereunder; the present and foreseeable location of
debtor’s books and records concerning any of the Collateral that is accounts is as set forth
on Annex A hereto, and the location of all other Collateral, including, without limitation,
Debtor’s inventory and equipment is as set forth on Annex A hereto; and, except as noted on
Annex A hereto, all such books, records, and Collateral are in Debtor’s possession.

     (e) Governmental Authority. Other than the filing of Financing Statements
contemplated hereby and appropriate filings to perfect the Security Interest in the
Intellectual Property, no Authorization, approval, or other action by, and no notice to or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required either (i) for the pledge by Debtor of
the Collateral pursuant to this Security Agreement or for the execution, delivery, or
performance of this Security Agreement by Debtor, or (ii) for the exercise by Secured Party
of the voting or other Rights provided for in this Security Agreement or the remedies in
respect of the Collateral pursuant to this Security Agreement (except as may be required in
connection with the disposition of the Pledged Securities by Laws affecting the offering and
sale of securities generally).

     (f) Maintenance of Collateral. All tangible Collateral which is useful in and
necessary to Debtor’s business is in good repair and condition, ordinary wear and tear
excepted, and none thereof is a fixture except as specifically referred to herein in
Paragraph 5(d) hereof.

     (g) Liens. Debtor owns, leases or has valid rights to use all presently
existing Collateral, and will acquire or lease all hereafter-acquired Collateral, free and
clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens.

     (h) Collateral. Annex B-1 accurately lists all Collateral Notes, Collateral
Note Security, Pledged Shares, Partnership/Limited Liability Company Interests, commercial
tort claims, and Deposit Accounts (but in the case of Deposit Accounts, only those
maintained by Debtor with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A), and Annex E accurately lists all Material
Agreements in which Debtor has any Rights, titles, or interest (but such failure of such
description to be accurate or complete shall not impair the Security Interest in such
Collateral).

     (i) Instruments, Chattel Paper, Collateral Notes, and Collateral Note Security.
All instruments and chattel paper, including, without limitation, the Collateral Notes, have
been delivered to Secured Party, together with corresponding endorsements duly executed by
Debtor in favor of Secured Party, and such endorsements have been duly and validly executed
and are binding and enforceable against Debtor in accordance with their terms. Each
Collateral Note and the documents evidencing the Collateral Note Security are in full force
and effect; there have been no renewals or extensions of, or amendments, modifications, or
supplements to, any thereof

about which the Secured Party has not been advised in writing; and no “default” or
“event of default” has occurred and is continuing under any such Collateral Note or
documents evidencing the Collateral Note Security. Debtor has good title to the Collateral
Notes and Collateral Note Security, and such Collateral Notes and Collateral Note Security
are free from any claim for credit, deduction, or allowance of an Obligor and free from any
defense, condition, dispute, setoff, or counterclaim, and there is no extension or
indulgence with respect thereto.

     (j) Pledged Securities, Pledged Shares. All Collateral that is Pledged Shares
is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable, and the transfer thereof
is not subject to any restrictions, other than restrictions imposed hereunder and by
applicable securities and corporate Laws. The Pledged Securities securing the Obligations as
defined in the Credit Agreement include 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock or
other equity interests of each Domestic Subsidiary of the Debtor (and in the case of Foreign
Subsidiaries directly owned by Debtor, constitute 65% of the issued and outstanding common
stock or other equity interests of each Foreign Subsidiary). Debtor has good title to the
Pledged Securities, free and clear of all Liens and encumbrances thereon (except for the
Security Interest created hereby), and has delivered to Secured Party (i) all stock
certificates, or other instruments or documents representing or evidencing the Pledged
Securities (or in the case of Pledged Securities consisting of stock of Foreign Subsidiaries
directly owned by Debtor, certificates or other instruments or documents representing or
evidencing 65% of such stock), together with corresponding assignment or transfer powers
duly executed in blank by Debtor, and such powers have been duly and validly executed and
are binding and enforceable against Debtor in accordance with their terms or (ii) to the
extent such Pledged Securities are uncertificated, an executed Acknowledgment of Pledge with
respect to such Pledged Securities. The pledge of the Pledged Securities in accordance with
the terms hereof creates a valid and perfected first priority security interest in the
Pledged Securities securing payment of the Obligations.

     (k) Partnership/Limited Liability Company Interests. Each Partnership/Limited
Liability Company issuing a Partnership/Limited Liability Company Interest, is duly
organized, currently existing, and in good standing under all applicable Laws; there have
been no amendments, modifications, or supplements to any agreement or certificate creating
any Partnership/Limited Liability Company or any material contract relating to the
Partnerships/Limited Liability Companies, of which Secured Party has not been advised in
writing; no event of default, default, breach, or potential default has occurred and is
continuing under any Partnership/Limited Liability Company Agreement; and no approval or
consent of the partners of any Partnership/Limited Liability Company is required as a
condition to the validity and enforceability of the Security Interest created hereby or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby which has not been duly obtained by
Debtor. Debtor has good title to the Partnership/Limited Liability Company Interests free
and clear of all Liens and encumbrances (except for the Security Interest granted hereby).
The Partnership/Limited Liability Company Interests are validly issued, fully paid, and
nonassessable and are not subject to statutory, contractual, or other restrictions governing
their transfer, ownership, or control, except as set forth in the applicable
Partnership/Limited Liability Company Agreements or applicable securities Laws. All capital
contributions required to be made by the terms of the Partnership/Limited Liability Company
Agreements for each Partnership/Limited Liability Company have been made. No limited
liability company interests are evidenced by certificates.

instruments, payment intangibles, or general intangibles is free from any claim for credit,
deduction, or allowance of an Obligor, from any defense, condition, dispute, setoff, or
counterclaim (collectively “Deductions”), and there is no extension or indulgence with
respect thereto, except to the extent such Deductions, extensions and indulgences could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (m) Material Agreements. Each Material Agreement is in full force and effect;
there have been no amendments, modifications, or supplements to any Material Agreement of
which Secured Party has not been advised in writing; and no event of default, default,

hereto.

with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. described on 
Annex B-1, (i) Debtor maintains each Deposit
Account with such bank, (ii) upon request by the Administrative Agent, Debtor shall use its
best efforts to, within thirty (30) days of such request, cause each such bank to
acknowledge to Secured Party that each such Deposit Account is subject to the Security
Interest and Liens herein created, that the pledge of such Deposit Account has been recorded
in the books and records of such bank, and that Secured Party shall have “control” (as
defined in the UCC) over such Deposit Account, and (iii) Debtor has the legal Right to
pledge and assign to Secured Party the funds deposited and to be deposited in each such
Deposit Account.

any pledges, assignments, licenses, user agreements, and covenants by Debtor not to
sue third Persons, other than Permitted Liens or licenses permitted by Paragraph
8(c).

     (iii) To Debtor’s knowledge, no third party is infringing any of Debtor’s
Rights under the Intellectual Property.

Annex B-2 hereto has been properly registered with the United States Copyright
Office and in corresponding offices throughout the world (where appropriate).

     (vi) To Debtor’s knowledge, no claims with respect to the Intellectual Property
have been asserted and are pending (i) to the effect that the sale, licensing,
pledge, or use of any of the products of Debtor’s business infringes any other
party’s valid copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret, or other
intellectual property Right, (ii) against the use by Debtor of any Intellectual
Property used in the Debtor’s business as currently conducted, or (iii) challenging
the ownership or use by Debtor of any of the Intellectual Property that Debtor
purports to own or use, nor, to Debtor’s knowledge, is there a valid basis for such
a claim described in this Paragraph 5(o)(vi).

The foregoing representations and warranties will be true and correct in all respects with respect
to any additional Collateral or additional specific descriptions of certain Collateral delivered to
Secured Party in the future by Debtor. The failure of any of these representations or warranties or
any description of Collateral therein to be accurate or complete shall not impair the Security
Interest in any such Collateral.

     6. COVENANTS. So long as any Lenders are committed to make Credit Extensions under the Credit
Agreement, and until the Obligations are paid and performed in full, Debtor covenants and agrees
with Secured Party that Debtor will:

     (a) Credit Agreement. (i) Comply with, perform, and be bound by all covenants
and agreements in the Credit Agreement that are applicable to it, its assets, or its
operations, each of which is hereby ratified and confirmed.

     (b) Information/Record of Collateral. Maintain, at the place where Debtor is
entitled to receive notices under the Loan Documents, a current record of where all

business hours to inspect and make abstracts from such records, and furnish to Secured
Party, at such intervals as Secured Party may request, such documents, lists, descriptions,
certificates, and other information as may be necessary or proper to keep Secured Party
informed with respect to the identity, location, status, condition, and value of the
Collateral. In addition, from time to time at the request of Secured Party deliver to
Secured Party such information regarding Debtor as Secured Party may reasonably request.

     (c) Annexes. Together with the delivery of compliance certificates pursuant to
Section 6.02(a) of the Credit Agreement, update all annexes hereto if any information
therein shall become inaccurate or incomplete. Notwithstanding any other provision herein,
Debtor’s failure to describe any Collateral required to be listed on any annex hereto shall
not impair Secured Party’s Security Interest in the Collateral.

     (d) Perform Obligations. Fully perform all of Debtor’s duties under and in
connection with each transaction to which the Collateral, or any part thereof, relates, so
that the amounts thereof shall actually become payable in their entirety to Secured Party.
Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) Debtor shall
remain liable under the contracts, agreements, documents, and instruments included in the
Collateral to the extent set forth therein to perform all of its duties and obligations
thereunder to the same extent as if this

Security Agreement had not been executed, (ii) the exercise by Secured Party of any of
its Rights or remedies hereunder shall not release Debtor from any of its duties or
obligations under the contracts, agreements, documents, and instruments included in the
Collateral, and (iii) Secured Party shall not have any indebtedness, liability, or
obligation under any of the contracts, agreements, documents, and instruments included in
the Collateral by reason of this Security Agreement, and Secured Party shall not be

action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder.

     (e) Notices. (i) Except as may be otherwise expressly permitted under the terms
of the Credit Agreement, promptly notify Secured Party of (A) any material change in the
nature of the Collateral, (B) any material damage to or loss of Collateral, and (C) the
occurrence of any other event or condition (including, without limitation, matters as to
Lien priority) that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Collateral (taken as a whole) or the Security Interest created hereunder; and (ii) give
Secured Party thirty (30) days written notice before any proposed (A) relocation of its
principal place of business or chief executive office, (B) change of its name, identity, or

of the Security Interests in all of the Collateral.

     (f) Collateral in Trust. Hold in trust (and not commingle with other assets of
Debtor) for Secured Party all Collateral that is chattel paper, instruments, Collateral
Notes, Pledged Securities, or documents at any time received by Debtor, and promptly deliver
same to Secured Party, unless Secured Party at its option (which may be evidenced only by a
writing signed by Secured Party stating that Secured Party elects to permit Debtor to so
retain) permits Debtor to retain the same, but any chattel paper, instruments, Collateral
Notes, Pledged Securities, or documents so retained shall be marked to state that they are
assigned to Secured Party; each such instrument shall be endorsed to the order of Secured
Party (but the failure of same to be so marked or endorsed shall not impair the Security
Interest thereon).

     (g) Control. Execute all documents and take any action required by Secured
Party in order for Secured Party to obtain “control” (as defined in the UCC) with respect to
Collateral consisting of Deposit Accounts, investment property, uncertificated Pledged
Securities, and letter-of-credit rights. If Debtor at any time holds or acquires an interest
in any electronic chattel paper or any “transferable record,” as that term is defined in the
federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, or in the Uniform
Electronic Transactions Act as in effect in any relevant jurisdiction, promptly notify
Secured Party thereof and, at the request of Secured Party, take such action as Secured
Party may reasonably request to vest in Secured Party control under the UCC of such
electronic chattel paper or control under the federal Electronic Signatures

in Global and National Commerce Act or, as the case may be, the Uniform Electronic

or after a Default or Event of Default: (1) file or cause to be filed such applications and
take such other actions as Secured Party may request to obtain the consent or approval of
any Governmental Authority to Secured Party’s Rights hereunder including, without
limitation, the Right to sell all the Collateral upon an Event of Default without additional
consent or approval from such Governmental Authority (and, because Debtor agrees that
Secured Party’s remedies at Law for failure of Debtor to comply with this provision would be
inadequate and that such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, Debtor
agrees that its covenants in this provision may be specifically enforced); (ii) from time to
time promptly execute and deliver to Secured Party all such other assignments, certificates,
supplemental documents, and financing statements, and do all other acts or things as Secured
Party may reasonably request in order to more fully create, evidence, perfect, continue, and
preserve the priority of the Security Interest and to carry out the provisions of this
Security Agreement; and (iii) pay all filing fees in connection with any financing,
continuation, or termination statement or other instrument with respect to the Security
Interests.

     (i) Encumbrances. Not create, permit, or suffer to exist, and shall defend the

Liens, and shall defend Debtor’s Rights in the Collateral and Secured Party’s Security
Interest in the Collateral against the claims and demands of all Persons except those
holding or claiming Permitted Liens. Debtor shall do nothing to impair the Rights of Secured
Party in the Collateral.

     (j) Intentionally Deleted.

     (k) Intentionally Deleted.

     (1) Certificates of Title. Upon the request of Secured Party, if certificates
of title are issued or outstanding with respect to any of the Vehicles or other Collateral,
cause the Security Interest to be properly noted thereon.

     (m) Warehouse Receipts Non-Negotiable. If any warehouse receipt or receipt in
the nature of a warehouse receipt is issued in respect of any of the Collateral, agree that
such warehouse receipt or receipt in the nature thereof shall not be “negotiable” (as such
term is used in Section 7-104 of the UCC) unless such warehouse receipt or receipt in the
nature thereof is delivered to Secured Party.

     (n) Impairment of Collateral. Not use any of the Collateral, or permit the same
to be used, for any unlawful purpose, in any manner that is reasonably likely to adversely
impair the value or usefulness of the Collateral, or in any manner inconsistent with the
provisions or requirements of any policy of insurance thereon nor affix or install any
accessories, equipment, or device on the Collateral or on any component thereof if such
addition will impair the original intended function or use of the Collateral or such
component.

limitation, the filing of any claims with any court, liquidator, trustee, custodian,
receiver, or other like person or party.

consent to any Partnership/Limited Liability Company selling, leasing, or disposing of

Debtor; and any and all additional shares of stock or other securities of each; (ix) deliver
to Secured Party a fully-executed Acknowledgment of Pledge, substantially in the form of

such Deposit Account has been recorded in the books and records of such bank and that
Secured Party shall have dominion and control over such Deposit Account; (iii) upon request
of the Secured Party, deliver to Secured Party all certificates or instruments, if any, now

and when due, any and all amounts owing under such accounts. Except in the ordinary course
of business consistent with prudent business practices and industry standards, without the
prior written consent of Secured Party, Debtor shall not (i) grant any extension of time for
any payment with respect to any of its accounts if the effect of such extension would be to
materially and adversely affect the aggregate value of all accounts or materially and
adversely affect the Debtor’s cash flow, (ii) compromise, compound, or settle any of the
accounts for less than the full amount thereof if the effect thereof would be to materially

now or hereafter pending;

     (ii) Except to the extent not required in Debtor’s reasonable business
judgment, make federal applications on all of its unpatented but patentable

     (iii) Preserve and maintain all of its material Rights in the Intellectual
Property and protect the Intellectual Property from infringement, unfair

Debtor’s reasonable business judgment including, without limitation, the

     (vi) Not enter into any agreement including, but not limited to any licensing
agreement, that is or may be inconsistent with Debtor’s obligations under this
Security Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents;

     (vii) Give Secured Party prompt written notice if Debtor shall obtain Rights to
or become entitled to the benefit of any Intellectual Property not identified on
Annex B-2 hereto; and

     (viii) If a Default or Event of Default exists, use its reasonable efforts to

     7. DEFAULT; REMEDIES. If an Event of Default exists, Secured Party may, at its election (but
subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement), exercise any and all Rights available
to a secured party under the UCC and other applicable law, in addition to any and all other

Allis-Chalmers Energy
Amended & Restated Pledge
and Security Agreement

15



 

Rights afforded by the Loan Documents, at law, in equity, or otherwise, including, without
limitation, (a) requiring Debtor to assemble all or part of the Collateral and make it available to
Secured Party at a place to be designated by Secured Party which is reasonably convenient to Debtor
and Secured Party, (b) to the extent permitted by Debtor’s insurance carrier, surrendering any
policies of insurance on all or part of the Collateral and receiving and applying the unearned
premiums as a credit on the Obligations, (c) applying by appropriate judicial proceedings for
appointment of a receiver for all or part of the Collateral (and Debtor hereby consents to any such
appointment), and (d) applying to the Obligations any cash held by Secured Party under this
Security Agreement, including, without limitation, any cash in the Cash Collateral Account (defined
in Section 8(h)).

     (a) Notice. Reasonable notification of the time and place of any public sale of
the Collateral, or reasonable notification of the time after which any private sale or other
intended disposition of the Collateral is to be made, shall be sent to Debtor and to any
other Person entitled to notice under the UCC; provided that, if any of the Collateral
threatens to decline speedily in value or is of the type customarily sold on a recognized
market, Secured Party may sell or otherwise dispose of the Collateral without notification,
advertisement, or other notice of any kind. It is agreed that notice sent or given not less
than ten Business Days prior to the taking of the action to which the notice relates is
reasonable notification and notice for the purposes of this subparagraph.

     (b) Condition of Collateral; Warranties. Secured Party has no obligation to
clean-up or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale. Secured Party may sell the Collateral
without giving any warranties as to the Collateral. Secured Party may specifically disclaim
any warranties of title or the like. This procedure will not be considered to affect
adversely the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral.

     (c) Compliance with Other Laws. Secured Party may comply with any applicable
state or federal law requirements in connection with a disposition of the Collateral and
compliance will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any
sale of the Collateral.

     (d) Sales of Pledged Securities.

     (i) Debtor agrees that, because of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the “Securities
Act”), or any other Laws or regulations, and for other reasons, there may be legal
or practical restrictions or limitations affecting Secured Party in any attempts to
dispose of certain portions of the Pledged Securities and for the enforcement of its
Rights. For these reasons, Secured Party is hereby authorized by Debtor, but not
obligated, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default,
to sell all or any part of the Pledged Securities at private sale, subject to
investment letter or in any other manner which will not require the Pledged
Securities, or any part thereof, to be registered in accordance with the Securities
Act or any other Laws or regulations, at a reasonable price at such private sale or
other distribution in the manner mentioned above. Debtor understands that Secured
Party may in its discretion approach a limited number of potential purchasers and
that a sale under such circumstances may yield a lower price for the Pledged
Securities, or any part thereof, than would otherwise be obtainable if such

Allis-Chalmers Energy
Amended & Restated Pledge
and Security Agreement

16



 

Collateral were either offered to a larger number of potential purchasers,
registered under the Securities Act, or sold in the open market. Debtor agrees that
any such private sale made under this Paragraph 7(d) shall be deemed to have been
made in a commercially reasonable manner, and that Secured Party has no obligation
to delay the sale of any Pledged Securities to permit the issuer thereof to register
it for public sale under any applicable federal or state securities Laws.

     (ii) Secured Party is authorized, in connection with any such sale, (A) to
restrict the prospective bidders on or purchasers of any of the Pledged Securities
to a limited number of sophisticated investors who will represent and agree that
they are purchasing for their own account for investment and not with a view to the
distribution or sale of any of such Pledged Securities, and (B) to impose such other
limitations or conditions in connection with any such sale as Secured Party
reasonably deems necessary in order to comply with applicable Law. Debtor covenants
and agrees that it will execute and deliver such documents and take such other
action as Secured Party reasonably deems necessary in order that any such sale may
be made in compliance with applicable Law. Upon any such sale Secured Party shall
have the Right to deliver, assign, and transfer to the purchaser thereof the Pledged
Securities so sold. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the Pledged
Securities so sold absolutely free from any claim or Right of Debtor of whatsoever
kind, including any equity or Right of redemption of Debtor. Debtor, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, hereby specifically waives all Rights of redemption,
stay, or appraisal which it has or may have under any Law now existing or hereafter
enacted.

     (iii) Debtor agrees that ten days’ written notice from Secured Party to Debtor
of Secured Party’s intention to make any such public or private sale or sale at a
broker’s board or on a securities exchange shall constitute reasonable notice under
the UCC. Such notice shall (A) in case of a public sale, state the time and place
fixed for such sale, (B) in case of sale at a broker’s board or on a securities
exchange, state the board or exchange at which such a sale is to be made and the day
on which the Pledged Securities, or the portion thereof so being sold, will first be
offered to sale at such board or exchange, and (C) in the case of a private sale,
state the day after which such sale may be consummated. Any such public sale shall
be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or
places as Secured Party may fix in the notice of such sale. At any such sale, the
Pledged Securities may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as
Secured Party may reasonably determine. Secured Party shall not be obligated to make
any such sale pursuant to any such notice. Secured Party may, without notice or
publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned
from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for the sale, and such
sale may be made at any time or place to which the same may be so adjourned.

     (iv) In case of any sale of all or any part of the Pledged Securities on credit
or for future delivery, the Pledged Securities so sold may be retained by Secured
Party until the selling price is paid by the purchaser thereof, but Secured Party
shall not incur any liability in case of the failure of such purchaser to take up
and pay for the Pledged Securities so sold and in case of any such failure, such
Pledged Securities may again be sold upon like notice. Secured Party, instead of
exercising the power of sale herein

and Security Agreement

17



 

conferred upon it, may proceed by a suit or suits at Law or in equity to
foreclose the Security Interests and sell the Pledged Securities, or any portion
thereof, under a judgment or decree of a court or courts of competent jurisdiction.

     (v) Without limiting the foregoing, or imposing upon Secured Party any
obligations or duties not required by applicable Law, Debtor acknowledges and agrees
that, in foreclosing upon any of the Pledged Securities, or exercising any other
Rights or remedies provided Secured Party hereunder or under applicable Law, Secured
Party may, but shall not be required to, (A) qualify or restrict prospective
purchasers of the Pledged Securities by requiring evidence of sophistication or
creditworthiness, and requiring the execution and delivery of confidentiality
agreements or other documents and agreements as a condition to such prospective
purchasers’ receipt of information regarding the Pledged Securities or participation
in any public or private foreclosure sale process, (B) provide to prospective
purchasers business and financial information regarding Debtor and its Subsidiaries
available in the files of Secured Party at the time of commencing the foreclosure
process, without the requirement that Secured Party obtain, or seek to obtain, any
updated business or financial information or verify, or certify to prospective
purchasers, the accuracy of any such business or financial information, or (C) offer
for sale and sell the Pledged Securities with or without first employing an
appraiser, investment banker, or broker with respect to the evaluation of the
Pledged Securities, the solicitation of purchasers for Pledged Securities, or the
manner of sale of Pledged Securities.

     (e) Application of Proceeds. Secured Party shall apply the proceeds of any sale
or other disposition of the Collateral under this Paragraph 7 in the following order: first,
to the payment of all expenses incurred in retaking, holding, and preparing any of the
Collateral for sale(s) or other disposition, in arranging for such sale(s) or other
disposition, and in actually selling or disposing of the same (all of which are part of the
Obligations); second, toward repayment of amounts expended by Secured Party under Paragraph
8; and third, toward payment of the balance of the Obligations in the order and manner
specified in the Credit Agreement. Any surplus remaining shall be delivered to Debtor or as
a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. If the proceeds are insufficient to pay the
Obligations in full, Debtor shall remain liable for any deficiency.

     (f) Sales on Credit. If Secured Party sells any of the Collateral upon credit,
Debtor will be credited only with payments actually made by the purchaser, received by the
Secured Party, and applied to the indebtedness of the purchaser. In the event the purchaser
fails to pay for the Collateral, Secured Party may resell the Collateral and Debtor shall be
credited with the proceeds of the sale.

     8. OTHER RIGHTS OF SECURED PARTY.

     (a) Performance. If Debtor fails to keep the Collateral in good repair, working
order, and condition, as required by the Loan Documents, or fails to pay when due all Taxes
on any of the Collateral in the manner required by the Loan Documents, or fails to preserve
the priority of the Security Interest in any of the Collateral, or fails to keep the
Collateral insured as required by the Loan Documents, or otherwise fails to perform any of
its obligations under the Loan

Allis-Chalmers Energy
Amended & Restated Pledge
and Security Agreement

18



 

Documents with respect to the Collateral, then Secured Party may, at its option, but
without being required to do so, make such repairs, pay such Taxes, prosecute or defend any
suits in relation to the Collateral, or insure and keep insured the Collateral in any amount
deemed appropriate by Secured Party, or take all other action which Debtor is required, but
has failed or refused, to take under the Loan Documents. Any sum which may be expended or
paid by Secured Party under this subparagraph (including, without limitation, court costs
and reasonable attorneys’ fees) shall bear interest from the dates of expenditure or payment
at the Default Rate until paid and, together with such interest, shall be payable by Debtor
to Secured Party upon demand and shall be part of the Obligations.

     (b) Collection. If an Event of Default exists and upon notice from Secured
Party, each Obligor with respect to any payments on any of the Collateral (including,
without limitation, dividends and other distributions with respect to the Pledged Securities
and Partnership/Limited Liability Company Interests, payments on Collateral Notes, insurance
proceeds payable by reason of loss or damage to any of the Collateral, or payments or
distributions with respect to Deposit Accounts) is hereby authorized and directed by Debtor
to make payment directly to Secured Party, regardless of whether Debtor was previously
making collections thereon. Subject to Paragraph 8(f) hereof, until such notice is given,
Debtor is authorized to retain and expend all payments made on Collateral. If an Event of
Default exists, Secured Party shall have the Right in its own name or in the name of Debtor
to compromise or extend time of payment with respect to all or any portion of the Collateral
for such amounts and upon such terms as Secured Party may determine; to demand, collect
receive, receipt for, sue for, compound, and give acquittances for any and all amounts due
or to become due with respect to Collateral; to take control of cash and other proceeds of
any Collateral; to endorse the name of Debtor on any notes, acceptances, checks, drafts,
money orders, or other evidences of payment on Collateral that may come into the possession
of Secured Party; to sign the name of Debtor on any invoice or bill of lading relating to
any Collateral, on any drafts against Obligors or other Persons making payment with respect
to Collateral, on assignments and verifications of accounts or other Collateral and on
notices to Obligors making payment with respect to Collateral; to send requests for
verification of obligations to any Obligor; and to do all other acts and things necessary to
carry out the intent of this Security Agreement. If an Event of Default exists and any
Obligor fails or refuses to make payment on any Collateral when due, Secured Party is
authorized, in its sole discretion, either in its own name or in the name of Debtor, to take
such action as Secured Party shall deem appropriate for the collection of any amounts owed
with respect to Collateral or upon which a delinquency exists. Regardless of any other
provision hereof, however, Secured Party shall never be liable for its failure to collect,
or for its failure to exercise diligence in the collection of, any amounts owed with respect
to Collateral, nor shall it be under any duty whatsoever to anyone except Debtor to account
for funds that it shall actually receive hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Secured Party shall have no responsibility for ascertaining any maturities,
calls, conversions, exchanges, offers, tenders, or similar matters relating to any
Collateral, or for informing Debtor with respect to any of such matters (irrespective of
whether Secured Party actually has, or may be deemed to have, knowledge thereof). The
receipt of Secured Party to any Obligor shall be a full and complete release, discharge, and
acquittance to such Obligor, to the extent of any amount so paid to Secured Party.

     (c) Intellectual Property. For purposes of enabling Secured Party to exercise
its Rights and remedies under this Security Agreement and enabling Secured Party and its
successors

Allis-Chalmers Energy
Amended & Restated Pledge
and Security Agreement

19



 

and assigns to enjoy the full benefits of the Collateral, Debtor hereby grants to
Secured Party an irrevocable, nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty
or other compensation to Debtor) to use, license, or sublicense any of the Intellectual
Property. Debtor shall provide Secured Party with reasonable access to all media in which
any of the Intellectual Property may be recorded or stored and all computer programs used
for the completion or printout thereof. This license shall also inure to the benefit of all
successors, assigns, and transferees of Secured Party. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default, Secured Party may require that Debtor assign all of its Right, title, and interest
in and to the Intellectual Property or any part thereof to Secured Party or such other
Person as Secured Party may designate pursuant to documents satisfactory to Secured Party.
If no Default or Event of Default exists, Debtor shall have the exclusive, non-transferable
Right and license to use the Intellectual Property in the ordinary course of business and
the exclusive Right to grant to other Persons licenses and sublicenses with respect to the
Intellectual Property for full and fair consideration.

     (d) Record Ownership of Securities. If an Event of Default exists, Secured
Party at any time may have any Collateral that is Pledged Securities and that is in the
possession of Secured Party, or its nominee or nominees, registered in its name, or in the
name of its nominee or nominees, as Secured Party; and, as to any Collateral that is Pledged
Securities so registered, Secured Party shall execute and deliver (or cause to be executed
and delivered) to Debtor all such proxies, powers of attorney, dividend coupons or orders,
and other documents as Debtor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling Debtor to
exercise the voting Rights and powers which it is entitled to exercise under this Security
Agreement or to receive the dividends and other distributions and payments in respect of
such Collateral that is Pledged Securities or proceeds thereof which it is authorized to
receive and retain under this Security Agreement.

     (e) Voting of Securities. As long as no Event of Default exists, Debtor is
entitled to exercise all voting Rights pertaining to any Pledged Securities and
Partnership/Limited Liability Company Interests; provided however, that no vote shall be
cast or consent, waiver, or ratification given or action taken without the prior written
consent of Secured Party which would (x) be inconsistent with or violate any provision of
this Security Agreement or any other Loan Document or (y) amend, modify, or waive any term,
provision or condition of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, certificate of
formation, or other charter document, or other agreement relating to, evidencing, providing
for the issuance of, or securing any Collateral if such amendment, modification or waiver
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the value of the
Collateral or any part thereof; and provided further that Debtor shall give Secured Party at
least five Business Days’ prior written notice in the form of an officers’ certificate of
the manner in which it intends to exercise, or the reasons for refraining from exercising,
any voting or other consensual Rights pertaining to the Collateral or any part thereof which
might have a Material Adverse Effect on the value of the Collateral or any part thereof. If
an Event of Default exists and if Secured Party elects to exercise such Right, the Right to
vote any Pledged Securities shall be vested exclusively in Secured Party. To this end,
Debtor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Secured Party the proxy and
attorney-in-fact of Debtor, with full power of substitution, to vote, and to act with
respect to, any and all Collateral that is Pledged Securities standing in the name of Debtor
or with respect to which Debtor is entitled to vote and act, subject to the understanding
that such proxy may not be exercised unless an Event of Default exists. The proxy herein
granted is coupled with an interest, is irrevocable, and shall continue until the
Obligations have been paid and performed in full.

(including, without limitation, insurance proceeds) may, at Secured Party’s option, be
applied in whole or in part to the Obligations (to the extent then due), be released in
whole or in part to or on the written instructions of Debtor for any general or specific
purpose, or be retained in whole or in part by Secured Party as additional Collateral. Any
cash Collateral in the possession of Secured Party may be invested by Secured Party in
certificates of deposit issued by Secured Party (if Secured Party issues such certificates)
or by any state or national bank having combined capital and surplus greater than
$100,000,000 with a rating from Moody’s and S&P of P-1 and A-1+, respectively, or in
securities issued or guaranteed by the United States or any agency thereof Secured Party
shall never be obligated to make any such investment and shall never have any liability to
Debtor for any loss which may result therefrom. All interest and other amounts earned from
any investment of Collateral may be dealt with by Secured Party in the same manner as other
cash Collateral. The provisions of this subparagraph are applicable whether or not a Default
or Event of Default exists.

     (g) Use and Operation of Collateral. Should any Collateral come into the
possession of Secured Party, Secured Party may use or operate such Collateral for the
purpose of preserving it or its value pursuant to the order of a court of appropriate
jurisdiction or in accordance with any other Rights held by Secured Party in respect of such
Collateral. Debtor covenants to promptly reimburse and pay to Secured Party, at Secured
Party’s request, the amount of all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, the
cost of any insurance and payment of Taxes or other charges) incurred by Secured Party in
connection with its custody and preservation of Collateral, and all such expenses, costs,
Taxes, and other charges shall bear interest at the Default Rate until repaid and, together
with such interest, shall be payable by Debtor to Secured Party upon demand

and shall become part of the Obligations. However, the risk of accidental loss or
damage to, or diminution in value of, Collateral is on Debtor, and Secured Party shall have
no liability whatever for failure to obtain or maintain insurance, nor to determine whether
any insurance ever in force is adequate as to amount or as to the risks insured. With
respect to Collateral that is in the possession of Secured Party, Secured Party shall have
no duty to fix or preserve Rights against prior parties to such Collateral and shall never
be liable for any failure to use diligence to collect any amount payable in respect of such
Collateral, but shall be liable only to account to Debtor for what it may actually collect
or receive thereon. The provisions of this subparagraph are applicable whether or not an
Event of Default exists.

     (h) Cash Collateral Account. If an Event of Default exists and is continuing,
Secured Party shall have, and Debtor hereby grants to Secured Party, the Right and authority
to transfer all funds on deposit in the Deposit Accounts to a Cash Collateral Account
(herein so called) maintained with a depository institution acceptable to Secured Party and
subject to the exclusive direction, domain, and control of Secured Party, and no
disbursements or withdrawals shall be permitted to be made by Debtor from such Cash
Collateral Account. Such Cash Collateral Account shall be subject to the Security Interest
and Liens in favor of Secured Party herein created, and Debtor hereby grants a security
interest to Secured Party on behalf of Lenders in and to, such Cash Collateral Account and
all checks, drafts, and other items ever received by Debtor for deposit therein.
Furthermore, if an Event of Default exists, Secured Party shall have the Right, at any time
in its discretion without notice to Debtor, (i) to transfer to or to register in the name of
Secured Party or any Lender or nominee any certificates of deposit or deposit instruments
constituting Deposit Accounts and shall have the Right to exchange such certificates or
instruments representing Deposit Accounts for certificates or instruments of smaller or
larger denominations and (ii) to take and apply against the Obligations any and all funds
then or thereafter on deposit in the Cash Collateral Account or otherwise constituting
Deposit Accounts.

     (i) Power of Attorney. Debtor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints
Secured Party and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true
and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the name of Debtor
or in its own name, to take after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default and from time to time thereafter, any and all action and to execute any and all
documents and instruments which Secured Party at any time and from time to time deems
necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Security Agreement and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Debtor hereby gives Secured Party the power and
Right on behalf of Debtor and in its own name to do any of the following after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and from time to time
thereafter, without notice to or the consent of Debtor:

     (i) to transfer any and all funds on deposit in the Deposit Accounts to the
Cash Collateral Account as set forth in herein;

     (ii) to receive, endorse, and collect any drafts or other instruments or
documents in connection with clause (b) above and this 
clause (i);

     (iii) to use the Intellectual Property or to grant or issue any exclusive (if
Debtor has exclusive rights to such Intellectual Property) or non-exclusive license
under the Intellectual Property to anyone else, and to perform any act necessary for
the Secured

Party to assign, pledge, convey, or otherwise transfer title in or dispose of
the Intellectual Property to any other Person;

     (iv) to demand, sue for, collect, or receive, in the name of Debtor or in its
own name, any money or property at any time payable or receivable on account of or
in exchange for any of the Collateral and, in connection therewith, endorse checks,
notes, drafts, acceptances, money orders, documents of title or any other
instruments for the payment of money under the Collateral or any policy of
insurance;

     (v) to pay or discharge taxes, Liens, or other encumbrances levied or placed on
or threatened against the Collateral;

     (vi) to notify post office authorities to change the address for delivery of
Debtor to an address designated by Secured Party and to receive, open, and dispose
of mail addressed to Debtor; and

     (vii) (A) to direct account debtors and any other parties liable for any
payment under any of the Collateral to make payment of any and all monies due and to
become due thereunder directly to Secured Party or as Secured Party shall direct;
(B) to receive payment of and receipt for any and all monies, claims, and other
amounts due and to become due at any time in respect of or arising out of any
Collateral; (C) to sign and endorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills of
lading, storage or warehouse receipts, drafts against debtors, assignments, proxies,
stock powers, verifications, and notices in connection with accounts and other
documents relating to the Collateral; (D) to commence and prosecute any suit,
action, or proceeding at Law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to
collect the Collateral or any part thereof and to enforce any other Right in respect
of any Collateral; (E) to defend any suit, action, or proceeding brought against
Debtor with respect to any Collateral; (F) to settle, compromise, or adjust any
suit, action, or proceeding described above and, in connection therewith, to give
such discharges or releases as Secured Party may deem appropriate; (G) to exchange
any of the Collateral for other property upon any merger, consolidation,
reorganization, recapitalization, or other readjustment of the issuer thereof and,
in connection therewith, deposit any of the Collateral with any committee,
depositary, transfer agent, registrar, or other designated agency upon such terms as
Secured Party may determine; (H) to add or release any guarantor, endorser, surety,
or other party to any of the Collateral; (I) to renew, extend, or otherwise change
the terms and conditions of any of the Collateral; (J) to endorse Debtor’s name on
all applications, documents, papers, and instruments necessary or desirable in order
for Secured Party to use or maintain any of the Intellectual Property; (K) to make,
settle, compromise or adjust any claims under or pertaining to any of the Collateral
(including claims under any policy of insurance); (L) to execute on behalf of Debtor
any financing statements or continuation statements with respect to the Security
Interests created hereby, and to do any and all acts and things to protect and
preserve the Collateral, including, without limitation, the protection and
prosecution of all Rights included in the Collateral; and (M) to sell, transfer,
pledge, convey, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any of the
Collateral as fully and completely as though Secured Party were the absolute owner
thereof for all purposes, and to do, at Secured Parry’s option and Debtor’s expense,
at any time, or from time to time,

Allis-Chalmers Energy
Amended & Restated Pledge
and Security Agreement

23



 

all acts and things which Secured Party deems necessary to protect, preserve,
maintain, or realize upon the Collateral and Secured Party’s security interest
therein.

This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. Secured
Party shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the Rights,
powers, privileges, and options expressly or implicitly granted to Secured Party in this
Security Agreement, and shall not be liable for any failure to do so or any delay in doing
so. Neither Secured Party nor any Person designated by Secured Party shall be liable for any
act or omission or for any error of judgment or any mistake of fact or Law. This power of
attorney is conferred on Secured Party solely to protect, preserve, maintain, and realize
upon its Security Interest in the Collateral. Secured Party shall not be responsible for any
decline in the value of the Collateral and shall not be required to take any steps to
preserve rights against prior parties or to protect, preserve, or maintain any Lien given to
secure the Collateral.

     (j) Purchase Money Collateral. To the extent that Secured Party or any Lender
has advanced or will advance funds to or for the account of Debtor to enable Debtor to
purchase or otherwise acquire Rights in Collateral, Secured Party or such Lender, at its
option, may pay such funds (i) directly to the Person from whom Debtor will make such
purchase or acquire such Rights, or (ii) to Debtor, in which case Debtor covenants to
promptly pay the same to such Person, and forthwith furnish to Secured Party evidence
satisfactory to Secured Party that such payment has been made from the funds so provided.

     (k) Subrogation. If any of the Obligations are given in renewal or extension or
applied toward the payment of indebtedness secured by any Lien, Secured Party shall be, and
is hereby, subrogated to all of the Rights, titles, interests, and Liens securing the
indebtedness so renewed, extended, or paid.

     (1) Indemnification. Debtor hereby assumes all liability for the Collateral,
for the Security Interest, and for any use, possession, maintenance, and management of, all
or any of the Collateral, including, without limitation, any Taxes arising as a result of,
or in connection with, the transactions contemplated herein, and agrees to assume liability
for, and to indemnify and hold Secured Party and each Lender harmless from and against, any
and all claims, causes of action, or liability, for injuries to or deaths of Persons and
damage to property, howsoever arising from or incident to such use, possession, maintenance,
and management, whether such Persons be agents or employees of Debtor or of third parties,
or such damage be to property of Debtor or of others. Debtor agrees to indemnify, save, and
hold Secured Party and each Lender harmless from and against, and covenants to defend
Secured Party and each Lender against, any and all losses, damages, claims, costs,
penalties, liabilities, and expenses (collectively, “Claims”), including, without
limitation, court costs and attorneys’ fees, and any of the foregoing arising from the
negligence of Secured Party or any Lender, or any of their respective officers, employees,
agents, advisors, employees, or representatives, howsoever arising or incurred because of,
incident to, or with respect to Collateral or any use, possession, maintenance, or
management thereof; provided however, that the indemnity set forth in this Paragraph 8(l)
will not apply to Claims caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Secured
Party or any Lender.

     9. MISCELLANEOUS.

Allis-Chalmers Energy
Amended & Restated Pledge
and Security Agreement

24



 

     (a) Continuing Security Interest. This Security Agreement creates a continuing
security interest in the Collateral and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the
termination of the obligations of Lenders to make Credit Extensions under the Loan Documents
and the payment in full of the Obligations; and (ii) inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by Secured Party, Lenders, and their respective successors, transferees, and
assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (ii), Secured Party and
Lenders may assign or otherwise transfer any of their respective Rights under this Security
Agreement to any other Person in accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 10.07
of the Credit Agreement, and to the extent of such assignment or transfer such Person shall
thereupon become vested with all the Rights and benefits in respect thereof granted herein
or otherwise to Secured Party or Lenders, as the case may be. Upon payment in full of the
Obligations, Debtor shall be entitled to the return, upon its request and at its expense, of
such of the Collateral as shall not have been sold or otherwise applied pursuant to the
terms hereof.

     (b) Reference to Miscellaneous Provisions. This Security Agreement is one of the “Loan
Documents” referred to in the Credit Agreement, and all provisions relating to Loan
Documents set forth in Article X of the Credit Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference, the same as if set forth herein verbatim.

     (c) Term; Release of Liens. Upon the later of (i) the termination of Lenders’
commitments to fund Borrowing under the Credit Agreement, and (ii) the full and final
payment and performance of the Obligations, the Administrative Agent shall release the liens
created by this Security Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01(d) of the Credit
Agreement; provided that no Obligor, if any, on any of the Collateral shall ever be
obligated to make inquiry as to the termination of this Security Agreement, but shall be
fully protected in making payment directly to Secured Party until actual notice of such
total payment of the Obligations is received by such Obligor. At such time as the Liens
created by this Security Agreement are to be released pursuant to this paragraph, Secured
Party shall, at the request and expense of the Debtor following such termination, promptly
deliver to the Debtor any Collateral held by the Secured Party hereunder, and promptly
execute and deliver to such Debtor such documents and instruments as the Debtor shall
reasonably request to evidence such termination and release as provided in the Credit
Agreement. In addition, if any of the Collateral shall be sold, transferred, assigned or
otherwise disposed of by the Debtor in a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement, then
the Secured Party, at the request and expense of the Debtor, shall promptly execute and
deliver releases as provided in the Credit Agreement.

     (d) Actions Not Releases. The Security Interest and Debtor’s obligations and
Secured Party’s Rights hereunder shall not be released, diminished, impaired, or adversely
affected by the occurrence of any one or more of the following events: (i) the taking or
accepting of any other security or assurance for any or all of the Obligations; (ii) any
release, surrender, exchange, subordination, or loss of any security or assurance at any
time existing in connection with any or all of the Obligations; (iii) the modification of,
amendment to, or waiver of compliance with any terms of any of the other Loan Documents
without the notification or consent of Debtor, except as required therein (the Right to such
notification or consent being herein specifically waived by Debtor); (iv) the insolvency,
bankruptcy, or lack of corporate or trust power of any party at any time liable for the
payment of any or all of the Obligations, whether now existing or hereafter occurring; (v)
any renewal, extension, or rearrangement of the payment of any or all of the

Allis-Chalmers Energy
Amended & Restated Pledge
and Security Agreement

25



 

Obligations, either with or without notice to or consent of debtor, or any adjustment,
indulgence, forbearance, or compromise that may be granted or given by Secured Party or any
Lender to Debtor; (vi) any neglect delay, omission, failure, or refusal of Secured Party or
any Lender to take or prosecute any action in connection with any other agreement, document,
guaranty, or instrument evidencing, securing, or assuring the payment of all or any of the
Obligations; (vii) any failure of Secured Party or any Lender to notify Debtor of any
renewal, extension, or assignment of the Obligations or any part thereof, or the release of
any Collateral or other security, or of any other action taken or refrained from being taken
by Secured Party or any Lender against Debtor or any new agreement between or among Secured
Party or one or more Lenders and Debtor, it being understood that except as expressly
provided herein, neither Secured Party nor any Lender shall be required to give Debtor any
notice of any kind under any circumstances whatsoever with respect to or in connection with
the Obligations, including, without limitation, notice of acceptance of this Security
Agreement or any Collateral ever delivered to or for the account of Secured Party hereunder;
(viii) the illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of all or any part of the Obligations
against any party obligated with respect thereto by reason of the fact that the Obligations,
or the interest paid or payable with respect thereto, exceeds the amount permitted by Law,
the act of creating the Obligations, or any part thereof, is ultra vires, or the officers,
partners, or trustees creating same acted in excess of their authority, or for any other
reason; or (ix) if any payment by any party obligated with respect thereto is held to
constitute a preference under applicable Laws or for any other reason Secured Party or any
Lender is required to refund such payment or pay the amount thereof to someone else,

     (e) Waivers. Except to the extent expressly otherwise provided herein or in
other Loan Documents and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Debtor waives
(i) any Right to require Secured Party or any Lender to proceed against any other Person, to
exhaust its Rights in Collateral, or to pursue any other Right which Secured Party or any
Lender may have; (ii) with respect to the Obligations, presentment and demand for payment,
protest, notice of protest and nonpayment, and notice of the intention to accelerate; and
(iii) all Rights of marshaling in respect of any and all of the Collateral.

     (f) Financing Statement; Authorization. Secured Party shall be entitled at any
time to file this Security Agreement or a carbon, photographic, or other reproduction of
this Security Agreement, as a financing statement, but the failure of Secured Party to do so
shall not impair the validity or enforceability of this Security Agreement. Debtor hereby
irrevocably authorizes Secured Party at any time and from time to time to file in any UCC
jurisdiction any initial or other financing statements and amendments thereto (without the
requirement for Debtor’s signature thereon) that (i) indicate the Collateral (A) as “all
assets of Debtor” or words of similar effect, regardless of whether any particular asset
comprised in the Collateral falls within the scope of Article 9 of the UCC of the state or
such jurisdiction or whether such assets are included in the Collateral hereunder, or (B) as
being of an equal or lesser scope or with greater detail, and (ii) contain any other
information required by Article 9 of the UCC of the state or such jurisdiction for the
sufficiency or filing office acceptance of any financing statement or amendment, including
(A) whether the Debtor is an organization, the type of organization, and any organization
identification number issued to Debtor and, (B) in the case of a financing statement filed
as a fixture filing or indicating Collateral as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, a
sufficient

description of real property to which the Collateral relates. Debtor agrees to furnish
any such information to Secured Party promptly upon request.

     (g) Amendments. This Security Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in
writing executed jointly by Debtor and Secured Party, and supplemented only by documents
delivered or to be delivered in accordance with the express terms hereof.

     (h) Multiple Counterparts. This Security Agreement has been executed in a
number of identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original for all purposes
and all of which constitute, collectively, one agreement; but, in making proof of this
Security Agreement, it shall not be necessary to produce or account for more than one such
counterpart.

     (i) Parties Bound; Assignment. This Security Agreement shall be binding on
Debtor and Debtor’s heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns and shall inure to
the benefit of Secured Party and Secured Party’s successors and assigns.

     (i) Secured Party is the agent for each Lender under the Credit Agreement and
each Affiliate of a Lender party to any Lender Hedging Agreement, the Security
Interest and all Rights granted to Secured Party hereunder or in connection herewith
are for the ratable benefit of each Lender and each such Affiliate, and Secured
Party may, without the joinder of any Lender or any such Affiliate, exercise any and
all Rights in favor of Secured Party or Lenders or any such Affiliates hereunder,
including, without limitation, conducting any foreclosure sales hereunder, and
executing full or partial releases hereof, amendments or modifications hereto, or
consents or waivers hereunder. The Rights of each Lender or any such Affiliate
vis-à-vis Secured Party and each other Lender or any such Affiliate may be subject
to one or more separate agreements between or among such parties, but Debtor need
not inquire about any such agreement or be subject to any terms thereof unless
Debtor specifically joins therein; and consequently, neither Debtor nor Debtor’s
legal representatives, successors, and assigns shall be entitled to any benefits or
provisions of any such separate agreements or be entitled to rely upon or raise as a
defense, in any manner whatsoever, the failure or refusal of any party thereto to
comply with the provisions thereof.

     (ii) Debtor may not, without the prior written consent of Secured Party, assign
any Rights, duties, or obligations hereunder.

     (j) Governing Law. The substantive laws of the State of Texas, except to
the extent the laws of another jurisdiction govern the creation, perfection, validity, or
enforcement of liens under this Security Agreement, and the applicable federal laws of the
United States, shall govern the validity, construction, enforcement and interpretation of
this security agreement and all of the other loan documents.

     (k) The provisions of Section 10.10 of the Credit Agreement are incorporated herein as
if set forth herein.

in and lien upon, (a) Account No.                      (the “Account”) maintained by Pledgor with you, (b)
any extensions or renewals of the Account if the Account is one which may be extended or renewed,
and (c) all of Pledgor’s right, title, and interest (whether now existing or hereafter created or
arising) in and to the Account, all sums from time to time on deposit therein, credited thereto, or
payable thereon, all instruments, documents, certificates, and other writings evidencing the
Account, and any and all proceeds of any thereof (the items described in clauses (a), (b) and (c)
being herein collectively called the “Collateral”),

In connection therewith, the parties hereto agree (which agreement by Pledgor will be construed as

account(s) identified below:


 

3.
 
The Account will be styled:






4.

Pledgee, allow any of the Collateral or any interest therein to be sold, transferred, or
withdrawn by or for the benefit of Pledgor.






6.
 
This letter agreement gives Pledgee “control” of the Account and the Collateral. The

7.

harmless from and against any and all claims, causes of action, liabilities, lawsuits,

exercise of its control over and secured rights in the Account and the Collateral except to
the extent that such claims, causes of action, liabilities, lawsuits, demands, and/or damages
are found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depository Bank.






8.
 
Pledgor agrees to indemnify and hold the Depository Bank, its officers and employees,
harmless from and against any and all claims, causes of action, liabilities, lawsuits,
demands, and/or damages, including, without limitation, any and all costs, including court
costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may arise or result from the Depository Bank
entering into and performing its obligations under this letter agreement except to the extent
that such claims, causes of action, liabilities, lawsuits, demands, and/or damages are found
in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depository Bank.






9.
 
The Depository Bank represents that it has not received notice regarding any lien,
encumbrance, or other claim to the Account or the Collateral from any person other than
pursuant to this letter agreement and has not entered into another agreement with any other
party to act on such party’s instructions with respect to the Account. The Depository Bank
further agrees not to enter into any such agreement with any other party.






10.
 
The Depository Bank subordinates’ to the security interest of Pledgee any right of recoupment
or set-off, or to assert any security interest or other lien, that it may at any time have
against or in any of the Collateral on account of any credit or other obligations owed to the
Depository Bank by Pledgor or any other person. The Depository Bank may, however, from time to
time debit the Account for any of its customary charges in maintaining the Account or for
reimbursement for the reversal of any provisional credits granted by the Depository Bank to
the Account, to the extent, in each case, that Pledgor has not separately paid or reimbursed
Depository Bank therefor.






11.
 
To the extent a conflict exists between the terms of this letter agreement and any account
agreement between Pledgor and the Depository Bank, the terms of this letter agreement will
control.






12.
 
The terms of this letter agreement will in no way be modified except by a writing signed by
