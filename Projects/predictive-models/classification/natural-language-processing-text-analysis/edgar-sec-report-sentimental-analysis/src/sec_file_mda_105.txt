item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the three months ended june 30, 2001 and 2000 summary amr's net loss for the three months ended 2001 was 507 million, or 3.29 loss per share, as compared to net earnings of 321 million, or 1.96 per share diluted, for the same period in 2000. amr's operating loss for the second quarter of 2001 was 760 million, compared to operating income of 517 million for the second quarter of 2000. as discussed in footnote 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, on april 9, 2001, the company purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of trans world airlines, inc. twa . accordingly, the operating results of twa since the date of acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the three month period ended june 30, 2001. in addition, amr's second quarter 2001 results include i a 430 million after tax charge, or 2.79 per share, related to the writedown of the carrying value of its fokker 100, saab 340 and atr 42 aircraft and related rotables in accordance with sfas 121, accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of see footnote 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements , and ii a 29 million after tax gain, or 0.19 per share, from the settlement of a legal matter related to the company's 1999 labor disruption. amr's second quarter 2000 results include an approximate 36 million after tax gain, or 0.21 per share diluted, related to the sale of the company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline.com incorporated priceline common stock. the company's revenues increased 572 million, or 11.4 percent, in the second quarter of 2001 versus the same period last year. however, excluding twa's revenues for the period april 10, 2001 through june 30, 2001, the company's revenues would have decreased by approximately 173 million versus the same period last year. during the second quarter of 2001, the company's results were impacted by a slowing u.s. economy, dampening the demand for business travel both domestically and internationally, and an increase in fare sale activity compared to the same period in 2000. american's passenger revenues decreased by 5.2 percent, or 217 million. american's yield the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile of 13.47 cents decreased by 2.1 percent compared to the same period in 2000. domestic yields decreased 2.3 percent from the second quarter of 2000. international yields decreased 1.4 percent, primarily due to a decrease of 12.3 percent and 3.3 percent in pacific and european yields, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately 3.4 percent in latin american yields. american's traffic or revenue passenger miles rpms decreased 3.1 percent to 29.5 billion miles for the quarter ended june 30, 2001. american's capacity or available seat miles asms of 41.0 billion miles increased 2.3 percent compared to the second quarter of 2000. as a result, american's load factor dropped 4 points year over year. american's domestic traffic decreased 4.7 percent on a capacity increase of 2.1 percent while international traffic increased 0.2 percent on a capacity increase of 2.7 percent. international activity included a 17.2 percent increase in traffic to the pacific on a capacity increase of 18.5 percent, a 1.7 percent decrease in traffic to europe on a capacity increase of 5.2 percent, and a 1.7 percent decrease in traffic to latin america on a capacity decrease of 2.5 percent. the overall increase in capacity was due primarily to an increase in the number of aircraft, partially offset by the company's more room throughout coach program. twa's passenger revenues were 671 million for the period april 10, 2001 through june 31, 2001. twa's traffic was 5.7 billion rpms while capacity was 8.0 billion asms. amr eagle's passenger revenues increased 11.1 percent, or 41 million. the increase in passenger revenues resulted from a 3.5 percent increase in passenger yield and a 7.2 percent increase in traffic, due to the continued addition of regional jets and steps taken to improve the carrier's network. other revenues increased 67 million, or 24.6 percent, due primarily to the addition of twa. 9 12 results of operations continued the company's operating expenses increased 41.1 percent, or approximately 1.9 billion, and included approximately 757 million related to twa's operations for the period april 10, 2001 through june 30, 2001. american's cost per asm increased 6.4 percent to 10.98 cents, excluding the impact of the second quarter 2001 asset impairment charge. the increase in american's cost per asm was driven partially by a reduction in asms due to the company's more room throughout coach program. adjusted for this program, american's cost per asm grew approximately 2.9 percent, excluding the asset impairment charge. wages, salaries and benefits increased 27.0 percent, or 452 million, and included approximately 286 million related to the addition of twa. the remaining increase of approximately 166 million related primarily to an increase in the average number of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the company's labor contracts. during the second quarter of 2001, the company recorded approximately 170 million in additional wages, salaries and benefits related to the company's tentative labor contracts. this was mostly offset by a 144 million decrease in the provision for profit sharing as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. aircraft fuel expense increased 48.5 percent, or 275 million, and included approximately 121 million related to the addition of twa. the increase in aircraft fuel expense was due to a 22.3 percent increase in the company's average price per gallon and a 21.2 percent increase in the company's fuel consumption, including twa. depreciation and amortization expense increased 19.7 percent, or 58 million, due primarily to the addition of new aircraft and an increase of approximately 25 million related to twa. other rentals and landing fees increased 64 million, or 25 percent, primarily due to the addition of twa. commissions to agents decreased 4.8 percent, or 13 million, and included approximately 31 million related to twa. despite an increase of approximately 10.9 percent in combined passenger revenues including twa the company continued to benefit from commission structure changes implemented in 2000 and a decrease in the percentage of commissionable transactions. food service increased 10.1 percent, or 20 million, due primarily to the addition of twa. aircraft rentals increased 75 million, or 49.7 percent, due to the addition of twa aircraft. the asset impairment charge of 685 million relates to the writedown of the carrying value of the company's fokker 100, saab 340 and atr 42 aircraft and related rotables see footnote 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements . other operating expense increased 25.6 percent, or 207 million, and included approximately 131 million related to twa. the remaining increase is due primarily to increases in data processing, outsourced services, travel and incidental, and external contract maintenance costs. other income expense , historically a net expense, increased 38 million due to a decrease in interest income of 10 million, or 29.4 percent, from the company's lower investment balances, an increase of 17 million in interest expense resulting from an increase in long term debt, and a decrease of 13 million in miscellaneous net relating primarily to the 57 million gain on sale of the company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline common stock in the second quarter of 2000 versus a 45 million gain during the second quarter of 2001 from the settlement of a legal matter related to the company's 1999 labor disruption. 10 13 results of operations continued operating statistics three months ended june 30, 2001 2000

operating loss for the six months ended june 30, 2001 was 764 million, compared to operating income of 729 million for the same period in 2000. on april 9, 2001, the company purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of twa. accordingly, the operating results of twa since the date of acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the six month period ended june 30, 2001. in addition, amr's 2001 results include i a 430 million after tax charge, or 2.79 per share, related to the writedown of the carrying value of its fokker 100, saab 340 and atr 42 aircraft and related rotables, and ii a 29 million after tax gain, or 0.19 per share, from the settlement of a legal matter related to the company's 1999 labor

percent compared to the same period in 2000. domestic yields increased 2.0 percent from the first six months of 2000. international yields increased 2.5 percent, reflecting an increase of 5.3 percent and 1.4 percent in latin american and european yields, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of 7.3 percent in pacific yields. yields were up year over year largely due to fare increases enacted over the course of 2000, which more than offset the increase in fare sale activity during the second quarter of 2001. american's traffic or rpms decreased 2.6 percent to 56.0 billion miles for the six months ended june 30, 2001. american's capacity or asms decreased 0.2 percent to 80.0 billion miles for the first six months of 2001. american's domestic traffic decreased 4.2 percent on a

activities in the six month period ended june 30, 2001 was 885 million, a decrease of approximately 924 million over the same period in 2000, due primarily to a decrease in income from continuing operations and a decrease in the change in the air traffic liability from the corresponding period in the prior year. capital expenditures for the first six months of 2001 were 2.1 billion, and included the acquisition of 14 boeing 737 800s, eight boeing 777 200ers, four boeing 757 200s, seven embraer 135 aircraft, six embraer 145 aircraft, and the purchase of 18 mcdonnell douglas md 80 aircraft previously leased by twa. these capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and debt agreements. on april 9, 2001, the company purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of twa for approximately 742 million, which was funded from the company's existing cash and short term investments. the 742 million includes the 625 million purchase price paid to twa and various other acquisition costs, primarily the purchase of aircraft security deposits and prepaid rent. proceeds from the sale of equipment and property of 206 million included the proceeds received upon the delivery of three mcdonnell douglas md 11 aircraft to federal express. as of june 30, 2001, the company had commitments to acquire the following aircraft 55

all aircraft will approximate 1.5 billion during the remainder of 2001, 2.2 billion in 2002, 1.5 billion in 2003 and an aggregate of approximately 1.3 billion in 2004 through 2006. the company expects to fund its remaining 2001 capital expenditures from the company's existing cash and short term investments, internally generated cash and new financing depending upon market conditions and the company's evolving view of its long term needs. the company announced in january 2001 that it had agreed to acquire or lease from united airlines, inc. united certain key strategic assets slots, gates and aircraft of us airways group, inc. us airways and to jointly operate the northeast shuttle new york washington boston with united upon the consummation of the previously announced merger between united and us airways. in addition, american announced that it had agreed to acquire a 49 percent stake in, and to enter into an exclusive marketing agreement with, d.c. air, llc d.c. air . 14 17 on july 27, 2001, united and us airways announced that they had agreed to terminate the merger agreement between them. upon termination of that merger agreement, the agreement between american and united automatically terminated. in addition, as the transactions between american and d.c. air were contingent upon the closing of the united us airways merger, the transactions between american and d.c. air discussed above will not be consummated. new accounting pronouncements in july 2001, the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no. 141, business combinations sfas 141 and no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142 . sfas 141 prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method for business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001 and includes criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. sfas 142 includes the requirement to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them. the company will adopt sfas 142 in the first quarter of 2002, and currently estimates discontinuing the amortization of approximately 62 million on an annualized basis. the company is currently evaluating what additional impact these new accounting standards may have on the company's financial position or results of operations. outlook for 2001 the company expects the soft revenue environment experienced during the first half of the year to continue throughout the remainder of 2001. in addition, the company expects to see significantly higher labor costs, given recent industry trends and american's recently negotiated tentative agreements with its flight attendants and mechanics. in response to the resulting earnings pressure, coupled with the continued uncertainty surrounding fuel costs, the company has announced that it has or will i retire 27 aircraft earlier than planned, including the retirement of its entire fleet of mcdonnell douglas dc 9 aircraft by the first quarter of 2002, ii adjust capacity in certain markets by either reducing the size of the aircraft flown or reducing the number of frequencies operated, iii opt to not exercise certain aircraft purchase rights, iv implement a management and support staff hiring freeze, v reduce discretionary operating expenses where possible, and vi reduce or delay long term capital spending projects and freeze all discretionary capital spending. notwithstanding these actions, if current economic conditions persist, the company expects to incur a loss for the third quarter and full year 2001. forward
