PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




 
 
 




Note 1 -

 
The financial statements included in this report reflect all
normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the
Corporation’s consolidated financial position at March 31, 2005
and December 31, 2004 and the consolidated results of operations
and the consolidated cash flows for the three-month periods
ended March 31, 2005 and 2004. The unaudited results of
operations for the interim periods reported are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the full year.


 
 
 




 
Certain notes and other information have been condensed or
omitted from these interim financial statements. These
statements, therefore, should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes included in
the Corporation’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2004.


 
 
 




 
FASB Staff Position No. FAS 19-1, Accounting for Suspended Well
Costs, was issued in April 2005 and will be effective in the
third quarter. This FASB Staff Position (FSP) addresses
circumstances that would permit the continued capitalization of
exploratory well costs beyond one year. The Corporation does
not expect that this FSP will have a material effect on its
financial position or results of operations.


 
 
 




 
During the first quarter of 2005, the Corporation expensed $93 million of capitalized
exploratory well costs ($55 million capitalized at year-end 2004) relating to two
deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells. Other than current period exploratory drilling costs,
there were no other material changes to capitalized exploratory well costs at March 31,
2005 compared with December 31, 2004.

During the first quarter of 2005, the Corporation permanently reduced LIFO inventories,
which are carried at lower costs than current inventory costs. The effect of the LIFO
inventory liquidation, before income taxes, was to decrease cost of products sold by
approximately $11 million.

Note 9 -

 
The Corporation records compensation expense for restricted common stock ratably over
the vesting period, which is generally three to five years. The Corporation uses the
intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options. Because the exercise
prices of employee stock options equal or exceed the market price of the stock on the
date of grant, the Corporation does not recognize compensation expense.

The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of employee
stock options for pro forma disclosure. Using the fair value method, stock option
expense would be recognized over the one- to three-year vesting periods. The
following pro forma financial information presents the effect on net income and
earnings per share as if the Corporation used the fair value method (in millions,
except per share data):

In 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board reissued Statement No. 123, Share-Based
Payment (FAS 123R). This new standard requires that compensation expense for all
stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be
recognized in the income statement based on fair values. The Corporation must adopt FAS
123R no later than January 1, 2006. Had the Corporation adopted FAS 123R in the periods
shown above, the impact would have approximated the additional compensation expense
disclosed in the above table.

The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in other comprehensive
income (loss) to earnings at the time the hedged transactions are recognized. Hedging
decreased exploration and production results by $195 million ($308 million before income
taxes) in the first quarter of 2005 and $73 million ($118 million before income taxes) in
the first quarter of 2004.


 
 
 




 
At March 31, 2005, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included after-tax
deferred losses of $1,658 million ($144 million of
realized losses and $1,514 million of unrealized losses) related to crude oil
contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales. Realized losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income represent losses on closed contracts that are
deferred until the underlying barrels are sold. After-tax realized losses will reduce
2005 income as follows: second quarter - $51 million, third
quarter - $48 million and
fourth quarter - $45 million. The pre-tax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected
in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax
assets on the balance sheet.


 
 
 




 
In its energy marketing business, the Corporation has entered into cash flow hedges to
fix the purchase prices of natural gas, heating oil, residual fuel oil and electricity
related to contracted future sales. At March 31, 2005, the net after-tax deferred gain
in accumulated other comprehensive income from these hedge contracts was $27 million.

Item 2. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.


      Overview
          The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two
segments, exploration and production (E&P) and refining and marketing (R&M). The E&P
segment explores for, produces and sells crude oil and natural gas. The R&M segment
manufactures, purchases, trades and markets refined petroleum products and other energy
products. Net income was $219 million for the first quarter of 2005, including $263
million from E&P activities and $63 million from R&M operations.



          Exploration and Production: Worldwide oil and gas production averaged 358,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day during the first quarter of 2005. In this period,
production commenced from three new fields. In the joint development area of Malaysia
and Thailand, production started on Block A-18, which is currently producing natural gas
at the rate of approximately 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Corporation
expects net production from this field to reach approximately 23,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day, following completion of the buyers’ gas separation plant, which is
expected by the end of the fourth quarter of 2005. In the United Kingdom, the Clair
Field commenced production and is currently producing 1,200 barrels of crude oil per
day. The Corporation expects production to increase to a net plateau rate of 6,000
barrels per day. In Azerbaijan, the Corporation has a 2.72% working interest in the ACG
fields where crude oil production from the Central Azeri Field started in mid-February.



          At the end of March 2005, the Corporation acquired a 65% interest in a company
operating in the Volga-Urals region of Russia. Production is currently averaging 7,500
barrels of oil per day and the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities in this
region.



          In Equatorial
Guinea, the Corporation has awarded major contracts on the Okume
Complex and the project is on schedule to begin production in early 2007.



          During the first quarter of 2005, the Corporation expensed two deepwater Gulf of
Mexico dry holes with costs totaling $93 million before income taxes ($61 million after
income taxes). In the second quarter, the Corporation plans to begin drilling two
offshore wells in Gabon and the Belud North well offshore Malaysia, which follows our
recent Belud South discovery. At the end of the second quarter, the Corporation
expects to begin drilling on the Ouachita prospect in Green Canyon Block 376 in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
     Overview (Continued)
          Refining and Marketing: In the first quarter of 2005, the Corporation received a
cash distribution of $112 million from HOVENSA. Also during the first quarter,
scheduled maintenance was completed on the fluid catalytic cracking units at HOVENSA and
Port Reading and the refineries are currently operating at full capacity.



          Corporate: In the first quarter of 2005, the Corporation’s Board of Directors
approved a plan to repatriate $1.3 billion of foreign earnings under the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004. As a result of approving the plan of repatriation, the
Corporation recorded a tax charge of $41 million.


     Results of Operations
          Net income for the first quarter of 2005 amounted to $219 million compared with
$281 million in the first quarter of 2004. See the following page for a table of items
affecting the comparability of earnings between periods. The after-tax results by major
operating activity for the three-months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows
(in millions, except per share data):

          In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are
disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax
basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings.
Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining
variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than
only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate
income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.



          The following items, on an after-tax basis, are included in net income in
the first quarter of 2005 and 2004 (in millions):

          The first quarter of 2005 includes a net gain of $11 million ($18 million before
income taxes) on the disposition of a mature North Sea asset. In addition, a net gain
of $11 million ($19 million before income taxes) was recorded on a legal settlement
reflecting the favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset sale. The
Corporation also recorded an income tax charge of $41 million related to the planned
repatriation of $1.3 billion of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004. Income in the first quarter of 2004 includes a net gain from an asset sale of $19
million and an income tax benefit of $13 million resulting from the completion of a
prior year United States income tax audit.

          After considering the gains from asset sales and the legal settlement described
above, the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily
attributable to changes in selling prices, sales volumes and operating costs and
exploration expenses, as discussed below.



          Selling prices: Higher average selling prices of crude oil and natural gas
increased exploration and production revenues by $157 million in the first quarter of
2005 compared with 2004. The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows:

     Results of Operations (Continued)
          The Corporation has after-tax, deferred hedge losses of $1,658 million recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at March 31, 2005 related to crude oil
hedges. Of this amount, $1,514 million is unrealized and relates to open hedge
positions and the remaining $144 million is realized and relates to closed hedge
positions. The deferred realized loss will be recognized in earnings as the underlying
barrels are sold. In addition to the gains or losses on open hedge positions, the
deferred realized loss on closed hedge positions will reduce earnings during the
remainder of 2005 as follows: second quarter - $51 million,
third quarter - $48 million
and fourth quarter - $45 million. See Market Risk Disclosure for a summary of the
Corporation’s open hedge positions.



          Sales and production volumes: The Corporation’s oil and gas production, on a
barrel of oil equivalent basis was 358,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2005
compared with 346,000 barrels per day in the same period of 2004. The Corporation
anticipates that its average production for the full year of 2005 will be approximately
350,000 barrels per day. The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production in the first

          Increased production in the first quarter of 2005 includes production from the
Llano Field in the Gulf of Mexico, which commenced in the second quarter of 2004. In
addition, new production began in the first quarter of 2005 from Block A-18 in the joint
development area of Malaysia and Thailand, the Clair Field in the United Kingdom and the
Central Azeri Field in Azerbaijan. Due to the timing of liftings in each period, sales
volumes were comparable in the first quarter of 2005 and 2004.



          Operating costs and exploration expenses: Production expenses were higher in the
first quarter of 2005 reflecting increased production volumes as well as increased
maintenance expenses and higher production taxes. Exploration expense was higher in the
first quarter of 2005 compared with the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to
increased dry hole expense on deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells. In addition,
depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were higher in the first quarter of
2005 due to increased production and higher depreciation rates.



          Other: After-tax foreign currency gains amounted to $8 million ($3 million before
income taxes) in the first quarter of 2005 compared with losses of $3 million ($13
million before income taxes) in the first quarter of 2004. The pre-tax amounts of
foreign currency gains (losses) are included in non-operating income (expense) in the
income statement.



          The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in the
first quarter of 2005 was 42% compared with 46% in the first quarter of 2004.



          The Corporation’s future exploration and production earnings may be impacted by
volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production

          Earnings from refining and marketing activities amounted to $63 million in the
first quarter of 2005 compared with $112 million in the corresponding period of 2004.
The Corporation’s downstream operations include HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a 50% owned
refining joint venture with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA),
accounted for on the equity method. Additional refining and marketing activities
include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy marketing and trading
operations.



          Refining: Refining earnings, which consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s
results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on the PDVSA note and other
miscellaneous items, were $42 million in the first quarter of 2005 compared with $74
million in the first quarter of 2004. The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income,
after income taxes of $19 million, was $31 million in the first quarter of 2005 compared
with income of $51 million in the first quarter of 2004. The fluid catalytic cracking
unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for 30 days of planned maintenance in the first quarter.
Port Reading earnings were $7 million in the first quarter of 2005 compared with $14
million in the first quarter of 2004, reflecting the effects of a 36-day shutdown for
planned maintenance in 2005.

          After-tax interest on the PDVSA note amounted to $4 million in the first quarters
of 2005 and 2004. In 2005, the Corporation provided deferred income taxes at the Virgin
Islands statutory rate of 38.5% on HOVENSA’s income and the interest income on the PDVSA
note. In the first quarter of 2004, income taxes on HOVENSA’s earnings were offset by
available loss carryforwards.

          Marketing: Marketing earnings, which consist principally of retail gasoline and
energy marketing activities, were $13 million in the first quarter of 2005 compared with
$23 million in the same period of 2004. Retail gasoline operations generated losses in
the first quarter of 2005 and 2004 due to weak margins. Earnings from energy marketing
activities were comparable in the first quarter of 2005 and 2004. Total
refined product sales volumes were 462,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2005
and 483,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2004.



          The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades
energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions
for its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities,
including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership amounted to income of $8
million in the first quarter of 2005 and $15 million in the first quarter of 2004.



          Refining and marketing earnings will likely continue to be volatile reflecting
competitive industry conditions and supply and demand factors, including the effects of
weather.

     Results of Operations (Continued)
     Corporate
          After-tax corporate expenses amounted to $69 million in the first quarter of 2005
compared with $2 million in same period of 2004. The first quarter of 2005 includes an
income tax provision of $41 million for repatriation of foreign earnings to the United
States under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The results for the first quarter
of 2004 include a non-cash income tax benefit of $13 million resulting from the
completion of a prior year United States income tax audit. Excluding these items, the
increase in Corporate expenses is primarily due to severance and other benefit costs.

          After-tax interest expense for the full year of 2005 is anticipated to be lower
than in 2004, primarily due to increased capitalized interest.


     Sales and Other Operating Revenues
          Sales and other operating revenues increased by 10% in the first quarter of 2005
compared with the corresponding period of 2004. This increase principally reflects
increased selling prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products, partially
offset by lower sales volumes of refined products. The increase in cost of goods sold
also reflects the increased costs of refined products purchased.

during the first quarter of 2005. Debt reduction in the first quarter of 2004 was $13
million. Dividends paid were approximately $67 million in both periods. During the
first three months of 2005, the Corporation received proceeds from the exercise of stock
options totaling $16 million ($11 million in the same period of 2004).

     Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)
          Future Capital Requirements and Resources: Capital expenditures excluding
acquisitions, if any, for the remainder of 2005 are currently estimated to be
approximately $1,650 million. The Corporation anticipates that available cash and cash
flow from operations will fund these expenditures; however, revolving credit facilities
are available, if necessary.



          With higher crude oil prices, the Corporation’s collateral requirements under
certain contracts with hedging and trading counterparties have increased. Outstanding
letters of credit were $2,425 million at March 31, 2005, including $800 million drawn
against the Corporation’s revolving credit facility, $500 million under a committed
short-term letter of credit facility entered into in the first quarter of 2005, and the
remainder under uncommitted lines. Outstanding letters of credit were $1,487 million at
December 31, 2004. At March 31, 2005, the Corporation has $1,700 million available
under its $2.5 billion syndicated revolving credit agreement and has additional unused
lines of credit of $27 million, primarily for letters of credit, under uncommitted
arrangements with banks. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it
may issue $825 million of additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or
preferred stock.



          Loan agreement covenants allow the Corporation to borrow an additional $4.5 billion
for the construction or acquisition of assets at March 31, 2005. The maximum amount of
dividends that can be paid from borrowings under the loan agreements is $1.7 billion at
March 31, 2005.



          Libya: Prior to June 30, 1986, the Corporation had extensive exploration and
production operations in Libya; however, U.S. Government sanctions required suspension
of participation in these operations. The Corporation wrote off the book value of its
Libyan assets in connection with the cessation of operations. During 2004, the
Corporation received U.S. Government authorization to negotiate and execute an agreement
with the government of Libya that would define the terms for resuming active
participation in the Libyan properties. The U.S. Government has lifted most of the
sanctions imposed on Libya and has rescinded the Libya portions of the Iran-Libya
Sanction Act of 1976. As a result, the Corporation and its partners will be able to
resume operations in Libya if they are able to reach a successful conclusion to
commercial negotiations. If these negotiations are successful, management anticipates
capital expenditures will increase over the current plan.



          Repatriation Provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004: The American
Jobs Creation Act (the Act) provides for a one-time reduction in the income tax rate to
5.25% on eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a U.S. parent. In the first
quarter of 2005, the Corporation’s Board of Directors approved a plan to repatriate $1.3
billion of unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, the Corporation recorded a tax
provision of $41 million in the first quarter of 2005. The Corporation is reviewing the
possibility of additional repatriations during 2005. The maximum additional amount that
the Corporation could repatriate under the Act is approximately $600 million. The
Corporation estimates that an additional tax provision of up to $32 million would be
recorded, depending on the incremental amount repatriated, if any.

     Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)
          Credit Ratings: Two credit rating agencies have rated the Corporation’s debt as
investment grade; one agency’s rating is below investment grade. If another rating
agency were to reduce its credit rating below investment grade, the Corporation would
have to comply with a more stringent financial covenant contained in its revolving
credit facility. In addition, the incremental margin requirements with hedging and
trading counterparties at March 31, 2005 would be approximately $57 million.



          Other: In connection with the sale of six vessels in 2002, the Corporation agreed
to support the buyer’s charter rate on these vessels for up to five years. The support
agreement requires that if the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is
less than the stipulated support rate in the agreement, the Corporation will pay to the
buyer the difference between the contracted rate and the stipulated rate. The balance in
the charter support reserve at January 1 and March 31, 2005 was approximately $10
million.



          At January 1, 2005, the Corporation had an accrual of $39 million for severance and
vacated office costs in London. During the first three months of 2005, $2 million of
payments were made, reducing the accrual to $37 million at March 31, 2005. Additional
accruals totaling $35 million, before income taxes, for office space to be vacated are
anticipated in the second half of 2005.



          Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Corporation has leveraged leases not included
in its balance sheet, primarily
related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present
value of these leases is $471 million at March 31, 2005. The Corporation’s March 31,
2005 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 43.2% to 46.1% if the leases were
included as debt.



          The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSA’s crude oil
purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA. At March 31, 2005, the guarantee amounted to
$128 million. This amount fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and
related crude oil prices. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up
to a maximum of $40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior
debt obligations.

     Market Risk Disclosure
          In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks
related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and
electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In
the disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as non-trading activities.
The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest
in a trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks
primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products.



          Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign
exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity linked
securities in its non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are widely traded
instruments mainly with standardized terms.



          Quantitative Measures: The Corporation uses value-at-risk to monitor and control
commodity risk within its trading and non-trading activities. The value-at-risk model
uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value
over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order
sensitivities for options. The potential change in fair value based on commodity price
risk is presented in the non-trading and trading sections below.



          Non-Trading: The Corporation’s exploration and production segment uses futures and
swaps to fix the selling prices of a portion of its future production and the related
gains or losses are an integral part of its selling prices. As of March 31, the
Corporation has open hedge positions on a portion of its worldwide crude oil production,
but no natural gas hedges. Following is a summary of the crude oil hedges:

          Because the selling price of crude oil has increased significantly since the hedges
were acquired, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at March 31, 2005 includes
after-tax deferred losses of $1,658 million ($144 million of realized losses and $1,514
million of unrealized losses) related to crude oil contracts used as hedges of
exploration and production sales. As market conditions change, the Corporation may
adjust its hedge percentages.



          The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum
products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses futures and swaps to fix
the purchase prices of commodities to be sold under fixed-price sales contracts.



          The Corporation estimates that at March 31, 2005, the value-at-risk for commodity
related derivatives that are settled in cash and used in non-trading activities was $121
million ($108 million at December 31, 2004). The results may vary from time to time as
hedge levels change.



          Trading: The trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest
trades energy commodities and derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are
consolidated with those of the Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading
positions for its own account. These strategies include proprietary position management
and trading to enhance the potential return on assets. The information that follows
represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporation’s proprietary trading
accounts.



          In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil, natural
gas and refined product prices. Trading positions include futures, forwards, swaps,
options and energy commodity linked securities. In some cases, physical purchase and
sale contracts are used as trading instruments and are included in the trading results.
