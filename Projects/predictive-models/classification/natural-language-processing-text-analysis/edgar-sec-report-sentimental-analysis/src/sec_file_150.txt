Spherix
Incorporated

Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
1.                                      Basis
of Presentation
On January 1,
2006, Spherix transferred the assets of its InfoSpherix division to a new
wholly-owned subsidiary, InfoSpherix Incorporated (“InfoSpherix”).  The activities of the “BioSpherix” Division
continue to operate through Spherix Incorporated.  The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of both Spherix Incorporated and InfoSpherix Incorporated
(collectively, the “Company”).  All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The accompanying
consolidated financial statements of the Company are unaudited and do not
include all of the information and disclosures generally required for annual
financial statements.  In the opinion of
management, the statements contain all material adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial
position as of March 31, 2007, the results of its operations for the
three-month periods ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, and its cash flows for the
three-month periods ended March 31, 2007 and 2006.  This report should be read in conjunction
with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which does contain the complete
information and disclosure for the year ended December 31, 2006.
2.                                      Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  This requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
period.  Accordingly, actual results
could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
3.                                      Net
Loss Per Share
Basic loss per
common share has been computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net loss per common share has been
computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding without an assumed increase in common shares outstanding for common
stock equivalents, as common stock equivalents are antidilutive.  Common stock equivalents consist of stock
options and warrants that are assumed likely to be exercised.  Common stock equivalents were 32,455 at March
31, 2006 and none at March 31, 2007.
4.                                      Stockholders’ Equity
During the three
months ended March 31, 2007, the Company sold 442,358 shares for an additional
$757,500 in proceeds under the July 22, 2005, Standby Equity Distribution
Agreement (“SEDA”).  At March 31, 2007,
the remaining maximum amount available for future draws under the SEDA was
$800,000.
On March 9, 2006,
in exchange for the Company’s agreement to reduce the exercise price to $2.04
per share, an institutional investor (“the Investor”) agreed to exercise the
remainder of its warrants for the purchase of 585,973 shares of common stock
for total proceeds of approximately $1.2 million.  In connection with these warrants, the
Investor agreed that it would not exercise any of the warrants to the extent
that it would acquire shares of Common Stock exceeding 9.9% of the outstanding
Common Stock, nor would it knowingly sell shares to anyone to the extent that
their holdings in the Company would exceed 4.9% of the outstanding Common
Stock.  The warrants and shares of Common
Stock were issued in transactions exempt from Registration pursuant to Section
4(2) of the Securities Act.  The Company
has registered the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants for resale by
the institutional Investor.
6 


5.                                      Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation
Effective January
1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123(R) “Share-Based Payment” (FAS 123R), which requires the measurement of all
employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, using a fair-value based method and the recording of such expense in
the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  The Company uses a Black-Scholes option
pricing model and has elected to use the modified prospective transition method
and, therefore, has not restated results for prior periods.  At the time the Company adopted FAS 123R,
there were no unvested options outstanding. 
For the three months ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company
recognized $6,933 and $3,466 in stock-based compensation expense relating to
59,000 stock options awarded in February 2006. 
The effect of adopting FAS 123R for the three months ended March 31,
2007 and 2006, increased the loss from operations, the loss before taxes, and
the net loss by $6,933 and $3,466 and had no effect on basic and diluted earnings
per share, net cash flow from operations, or net cash flow from financing
activities.
A summary of
option activity under the Company’s employee stock option plan for the three
months ended March 31, 2007, is presented below:

As of March 31,
2007, there were approximately 25,500 unvested options to purchase common stock
under the plans.  The total fair value of
the unvested options was approximately $47,940. 
An estimated compensation cost of $79,722 related to these unvested
options is expected to be recognized over the next three years.
The Company used
the following assumptions in the Black-Scholes calculation used to measure the
fair value of the February 2006 option awards in accordance with FAS 123R.

6.                                      Income
Tax
The Company
adopted Financial Standards Accounting Board Interpretation No. 48 Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“FIN 48”) on January 1, 2007.  As a result of the implementation of FIN 48,
the Company recognized no material adjustments. 
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on tax
liabilities as interest expense.  At
January 1, 2007 and March 31, 2007, the Company had no unrecognized income tax
benefits and recognized no interest or penalties on income tax liabilities.
The Federal and
significant State statutes of limitations have not expired for the Company’s
tax years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2005.  As such, each of these tax years remain
subject to examination by taxing authorities. 
The Federal and significant State statutes of limitations for the
Company’s tax years ended December 31, 1998, December 31, 1999 and December 31,
2002 have expired; however $10,217,142 of Federal net operating loss
7 


carryforwards generated
in these closed years remain available to the Company and are subject to
adjustment prior to utilization in future tax years.
7.                                      Information
by Business Segment
The Company operates via two principal segments,
BioSpherix and InfoSpherix.  BioSpherix
develops proprietary products for commercial applications.  InfoSpherix provides contact center
information and reservation services for government and industry, with
substantially all of InfoSpherix revenue generated from government customers.  Revenue from reservation and tourism services
is greatest in the spring and summer when vacation planning is the
heaviest.  Revenue from other sources
tends to be more evenly spread throughout the year, although the fourth quarter
is historically the low period of the year.
Financial
information by business segment for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and
2006 is summarized below:

8.                                      Subsequent
Event
In April 2007, the
Company committed to a plan to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary and on April 17,
2007 signed a non-binding letter of intent to sell the InfoSpherix.  The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of
its efforts on the BioSpherix Division’s biotechnology products, with the
principal focus on the commercialization of Naturlose.  The Company is in negotiations regarding the
terms of the sale and the sale is subject to several contingencies, including
execution of a definitive agreement of sale, and approval of the transaction by
the Company’s stockholders.  The sale is
expected to close by the end of the summer of 2007.  The InfoSpherix segment (see note 7)
comprises the majority of the Company’s operations.
Item 2.                          Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following is
intended to update the information contained in the Company’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and presumes that readers have
access to, and will have read, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in such Form 10-K.
Certain statements
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are identified by the use of
forward-looking words or phrases such as “believes,” “expects,” is or are “expected,”
“anticipates,” “anticipated,” “should” and words of similar impact.  These forward-looking statements are based on
the
8 


Company’s current
expectations.  Because forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company’s actual results could
differ materially.  See the Company’s
Form 8-K filing dated March 26, 1999, for a more detailed statement concerning
forward-looking statements.
Overview
The Company operates via two principal segments,
BioSpherix and InfoSpherix.  BioSpherix
develops proprietary products for commercial applications.  InfoSpherix provides contact center
information and reservation services for government and industry, with
substantially all of InfoSpherix revenue generated from government customers.
BioSpherix engages in product development, notably
tagatose.  The Company’s current focus is
on the non-food use of tagatose, which we will market under the name “Naturlose”.  Our principal efforts have been to explore
whether Naturlose is an effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  In April 2007, the Company commenced a Phase
3 trial for this purpose.
InfoSpherix has
developed a niche in providing campground and other reservation services via
its ReserveWorld business line and is one of only two major suppliers of
campground reservation services in the U.S. 
Reservation contracts make up over 50% of the Company’s revenue.  The reservation services contracts have
revenue streams that are historically greater in the spring and summer months
when vacation planning is more prevalent. 
These reservation contracts have certain fixed costs that continue
throughout the year such as depreciation, telephone and computer related
service and maintenance contracts, and minimum staffing requirements.  These contracts also incur certain costs in
advance of the peak seasons in order to staff up and train the work force that
will be needed during the peak seasons. 
On January 23, 2007, the Company concluded its long-standing National
Park Service contract.  The National Park
Service contract contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, and $174,000 and $794,000 in
revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
In April 2007, the
Company committed to a plan to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary and on April 17,
2007 signed a non-binding letter of intent to sell the InfoSpherix.  The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of
its efforts on the BioSpherix Division’s biotechnology products, with the
principal focus on the commercialization of Naturlose.  The Company is in negotiations regarding the
terms of the sale and the sale is subject to several contingencies, including
execution of a definitive agreement of sale, and approval of the transaction by
the Company’s stockholders.  The sale is
expected to close by the end of the summer of 2007.  The InfoSpherix segment (see note 7)
comprises the majority of the Company’s operations.

Revenue
and Direct Contract and Operating Costs
See “InfoSpherix” below.
Selling, General and
Administrative
Selling, general
and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2007, were
consistent with those of the same period of the prior year.  The Company’s selling, general and
administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management salaries and
fringes, sales and marketing costs, finance and accounting, and human
resources, as well as costs related to being a public company.

InfoSpherix
Revenue for the
three months ended March 31, 2007, decreased $575,000 (9.7%) from the same
period in 2006 due to the completion of the National Park Service contract,
which concluded on January 23, 2007. 
Reductions from the direct costs associated with the National Park
Service Contract were off-set by increased costs under the new Michigan
contract and additional costs incurred under the contracts transferred from the
former South Dakota facility to the new facility in Indiana.  The National Park Service contract
contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005, and $174,000 and $794,000 in revenue for the three
months ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
BioSpherix
The primary focus of BioSpherix’s research and development (R&D)
activities for the three months
ended March 31, 2007, has been on the planning and preparation of a Phase
3 clinical trial in the use of Naturlose for the treatment of Type 2
diabetes.  The Company has completed a
dose range-finding study, and the recruitment of patients for the trial, which
will take place in Australia and the United States, is on-going.  The first participants began the Phase 3
clinical trial in April 2007.  More than
400 subjects from the United States and abroad, representing the demographic
mix in the U.S., will receive oral doses of Naturlose to test its ability to
treat Type 2 diabetes.  A Phase 3
clinical trial, which gathers evidence regarding effectiveness and safety, is
needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of new drugs proposed
to the FDA.  The Company believes its
chances for a successful outcome are enhanced by the widely demonstrated safety
of the product, lack of safety being the primary cause for failure of most drug
candidates.
In 2005, the
Company contracted with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to
conduct a human clinical trial on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of
Naturlose.  The study demonstrated
tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is
sorbitol, a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products.  The study suggested ways of modifying the
Naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction.  Such modifications have been made, and the
Company has arranged with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to
conduct a trial of Naturlose toothpaste formulated by the Company in an attempt
to establish an anti-plaque claim for the toothpaste.  The clinical trial started in early 2007.
In the first
quarter of 2007, the Company expended $1.4 million in furtherance of its
BioSpherix R&D activities, as compared to $105,000 in the first quarter of
2006.  The increased level of
expenditures is primarily attributable to the Phase 3 trial.
Liquidity and Capital Resources,
Consolidated
On March 31, 2006,
the Company entered into a new agreement with Bank of America (“the Bank”) to
establish a line-of-credit (“New Agreement”) for its subsidiary, InfoSpherix
Incorporated, with the outstanding borrowings under the old line of credit
transferred to the new agreement.  The
New Agreement, which matures June 30, 2008, provides for borrowings up to $1.5
million, is collateralized by the subsidiary’s accounts receivables and
equipment, and contains covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to
EBITDA ratios.  Such covenants could have
a limiting effect on the amount of cash that the subsidiary can advance to
Spherix.  The interest rate under the
Agreement is based on the LIBOR daily floating rate plus 3% (approximately 8.5%
at March 31, 2007).  The Company had no
outstanding borrowings under the Agreement at March 31, 2007, and the total
amount available for future advances to the subsidiary was $1.5 million under
the Agreement.
10 


Working capital as
of March 31, 2007, was $9.5 million, which represents a $1.4 million decrease
from working capital of $10.9 million at December 31, 2006.  The decrease in working capital was largely
related to the Company’s Phase 3 clinical trial costs.
Spherix expects to
expend up to $5 million over the next year in costs related to the Phase 3
clinical trial and other R&D activity. 
The clinical trial is expected to take at least two years to
complete.  The Company intends to finance
the BioSpherix activities through Spherix’s cash reserves, proceeds from the
issuance of common stock, and proceeds from the sale of the InfoSpherix
subsidiary.  The Company also intends to
seek pharmaceutical partners to assist in completing development of the
BioSpherix products.
InfoSpherix
Incorporated intends to finance its furniture and equipment needs through
financing or leasing arrangements where practicable, including those related to
the start-up costs of new contracts the Company may win.
Cash flow for the
three months ended March 31, 2007, reflects a net cash outflow of $1.1 million,
consisting of $1.5 million used in operating activities, $552,000 used in
investing activities, and $1 million provided by financing activities.  The increase in cash used by operating
activities in 2007 from that of the prior year is primarily related to the cost
of the Phase 3 clinical trial.  Cash used
in investing activities was consistent with that of the prior year.  Cash flows from financing activities in 2006
included proceeds from the issuance of warrants.
Trends
and Outlooks
BioSpherix
·                  BioSpherix’s
primary emphasis is on a Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate that Naturlose
is a successful treatment for Type 2 diabetes. 
The first participants have already been enrolled and the trial began in
April 2007.
·                  Costs
of conducting the Phase 3 trial have substantially increased as we have
obtained further direction from the FDA concerning the processes to be employed
in the trial.  The Company expects to
spend up to $5 million in R&D costs over the next year.  The Company intends to use the proceeds from
the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary to fund the Phase 3 trial.  If the sale is not concluded, the Company
will need to reassess continuation of the tests in view of the increased costs
of the tests and the expected follow on costs in pursuit of FDA approval.
InfoSpherix
·                  The
Company concluded the National Park Service contract on January 23, 2007.  The National Park Service contract
contributed approximately $4 million in revenue for each of the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005.  The loss of
the National Park Service contract will have an adverse effect on the Company’s
financial results in comparison to the prior year.
·                  Since
1998, InfoSpherix has grown its government park reservation business from one
contract to 17 government reservation contracts.  InfoSpherix’s reservation business accounted
for over 60% of the Company’s revenue in 2006 and 2005, and over 50% for the
three months ended March 31, 2007. 
InfoSpherix is now one of only two major suppliers of Government
campground reservation services in the U.S.
·                  On
February 6, 2007, the Company signed an agreement to lease 32,423 square feet
of facility space in Frostburg, Maryland effective December 1, 2007, for use as
a call center to replace the existing Cumberland, Maryland facility.
·                  In
April 2007, the Company signed a non-binding letter of intent to sell the
InfoSpherix subsidiary.  The sale will
allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division’s
biotechnology products, with the principal focus on the commercialization of
Naturlose.

Item 3.           Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The Company
manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment
opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies.
At March 31, 2007,
the Company did not have any fixed-rate or variable-rate indebtedness.  The Company has not entered into any interest
rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness.
Cash available for
investment is typically invested in short term funds, which generally mature in
30 days, or money-market funds.  In
general, such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on
such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.  The carrying amounts approximate market
value.  It is the Company’s practice to
hold these investments to maturity.
Assuming the March
31, 2007, variable rate debt and cash and cash available for investment, a one
percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than
$100,000.
Item 4.                          Controls
and Procedures
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures.  We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports, such as this report on Form 10-Q,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. These controls and procedures are based closely
on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in
Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.  Rules adopted by
the SEC require that we present the conclusions of the Chief Executive
Officer/Chief Financial Officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.
Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls.  Management, including
our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud.  In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.  Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and management necessarily was
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures.  Because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have
been detected.  These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by
the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
management’s override of the control. 
The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions.  Over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur
and not be detected.
Periodic
Evaluation and Conclusion.   The Company carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management,
including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance
level.  There were no significant changes
in internal controls during the latest quarter over financial reporting that
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal
controls over financial reporting.
