item 2. management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition. overview the corporation had strong first quarter 2004 earnings of 281 million. earnings from exploration and production were 207 million in the first quarter of 2004, reflecting higher crude oil and natural gas prices and lower first quarter costs. refining and marketing earnings were 112 million for the first quarter of 2004, resulting from favorable refining margins and high utilization rates. the first quarter results may not be indicative of future operating results. the corporation continues to progress its twelve development projects. the llano field is expected to commence production in the second quarter and the installation of the offshore pipeline for the joint development area of malaysia thailand is proceeding as planned. in equatorial guinea, the plan of development for the northern block g fields is expected to be submitted to the government in june. with regard to libya, the united states government s easing of sanctions should allow the corporation and its partners to further advance plans to return to our operations there. negotiations regarding the terms of re entry are underway. results of operations net income for the first quarter of 2004 amounted to 281 million compared with 176 million in the first quarter of 2003. income in the first quarter of 2004

that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. after tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. exploration and production exploration and production earnings amounted to 207 million in the first quarter of 2004 compared with 120 million in the first quarter of 2003. these earnings include after tax gains on asset sales of 19 million and 31 million 19 million and 47 million before income taxes in the first quarters of 2004 and 2003, respectively. the gain in the first quarter of 2004 reflects the sale of an office building in aberdeen, scotland. the gain in the first quarter of 2003 is from the sale of the corporation s 1.5 interest in the trans alaska pipeline system. after considering the gains on asset sales described above, the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, sales volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses, as discussed below. 11 table of

102 million in the prior year period. sales and production volumes the change in crude oil and natural gas sales volumes in the first quarter of 2004 compared to the first quarter of 2003 did not materially affect earnings from continuing operations, however, crude oil and natural gas production was lower. the corporation s oil and gas production, on a barrel of oil equivalent basis, decreased to 346,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2004 from 421,000 barrels per day in 2003. approximately 60 of this decline was due to asset sales and exchanges in 2003. the remainder was due to maintenance and natural decline. the corporation anticipates that its average production for the full year of 2004 will be approximately 6 below the first quarter level. the corporation s net daily

exploration expenses from continuing operations decreased by approximately 88 million in the first quarter of 2004 compared with the corresponding period in the prior year. depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were lower in the first quarter of 2004 compared with 2003, reflecting lower production volumes and lower unit cost per barrel from changes in the mix of producing fields. production expenses decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2004 reflecting lower production volumes. exploration expense was also lower in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily because of lower dry hole costs. other after tax foreign currency losses amounted to 3 million 13 million before income taxes in the first quarter of 2004 compared with losses of 1 million 3 million before income taxes in the first quarter of 2003. the pre tax amounts of foreign currency losses are included in non operating income expense in the income statement. the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in the first quarter of 2004 was 46 compared to 56 in the first quarter of 2003. the corporation s future exploration and production earnings may be impacted by volatility in the

barrels per day in the first quarter of 2004 and 397,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2003. crude runs in the first quarter of 2003 were reduced as a result of interruptions in crude oil deliveries from venezuela. refining margins continued to be high in the first quarter of 2004 and sales volumes increased. income taxes on the corporation s share of hovensa s results were offset by available loss carryforwards. earnings from refining and marketing activities also include interest income on the note received from pdvsa at the formation of the joint venture. interest on the pdvsa note amounted to 7 million in the first quarter of 2004 and 8 million in the same period of 2003. interest income is recorded in non operating income in the income statement. retail, energy marketing and other results of retail gasoline operations were lower in the first quarter of 2004 compared with the corresponding period of 2003 reflecting higher wholesale fuel prices, although sales volumes

sales and other operating revenues increased by 6 in the first quarter of 2004 compared with the corresponding period of 2003. this increase principally reflects increased sales volumes of refined products partially offset by decreased sales of purchased gas in energy marketing. the increase in cost of goods sold also reflects the change in sales volumes of refined products. liquidity and capital resources overview cash flows from operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, totaled 394 million in the first quarter of 2004. cash and short term investments at the end of the first quarter of 2004 totaled 557 million, an increase of 39 million from year end. at march 31, 2004, the corporation s debt to capitalization ratio was 41.7 compared to

cessation of operations. on february 24, 2004, the corporation received u.s. government authorization to negotiate and enter into an executory agreement with the government of libya that would define the terms for resuming active participation in the libyan properties. on april 29, 2004, the u.s. government lifted most of the sanctions imposed on libya. it has also taken the necessary steps to have the iran libya sanctions act of 1976 terminated by congress with respect to libya. as a result, the corporation and its partners will be able to resume operations in libya if they are able to reach a successful conclusion to their ongoing commercial negotiations. if these negotiations are successful, management anticipates capital expenditures will likely increase over the current plan. production and reserves would also increase. credit ratings during the first quarter of 2004, two credit rating agencies downgraded their ratings of the corporation s debt. one of the revised ratings was below investment grade. consequently, the corporation s cash margin or collateral requirements under certain contracts with hedging and trading counterparties and certain lenders increased. outstanding letters of credit increased to 516 million at march 31, 2004 compared with 229 million at december 31, 2003. this increase relates to higher commodity prices and the additional collateral required because of the lower rating. all hedging and trading counterparty liabilities are recorded on the balance sheet. if an additional rating agency were to reduce its credit rating below investment grade, the incremental margin requirements at march 31, 2004 would not be material. other in connection with the sale of six vessels in 2002, the corporation agreed to support the buyer s charter rate on these vessels for up to five years. the support agreement requires that if the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is less than the stipulated support rate in the

are anticipated over the next several quarters. the estimated annual savings from this 2003 cost reduction initiative is approximately 50 million before income taxes. off balance sheet arrangements

is 459 million at march 31, 2004. the corporation s march 31, 2004 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 41.7 to 44.4 if the lease financings were included. the corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50 of hovensa s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than pdvsa. the amount of the corporation s guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices. at march 31, 2004, the guarantee totaled 185 million. in addition, the corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of 40 million to the extent hovensa does not have funds to meet
