item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated condensed financial statements and notes presented in this report. results of operations the consolidated results of operations for the quarter ended may 1, 1999 include the results of the former hills stores during the period they were operated by gordon brothers and the nassi group under an agency agreement. these firms were engaged to operate the hills stores until their closure and to liquidate the merchandise inventories. during the quarter ended may 1, 1999, gordon brothers and the nassi group completed the merchandise liquidation sales in 52 of the former hills stores. subsequent to the liquidation sales, the company remodeled 50 of these stores during an eight week period and, on april 19, 1999, the company re opened the remodeled stores as ames stores. in addition, gordon brothers and the nassi group initiated the liquidation sales in 55 former hills stores in late march and the final liquidation sales in 48 former hills stores in early may. the following table illustrates the results of ames' operations for the quarter ended april 29, 2000, as compared to the separate contributions of ames' and hills' operations and the other costs described below to the consolidated results of operations for the quarter ended may 1, 1999. for the thirteen weeks ended may 1, 1999 for the thirteen in thousands weeks ended april 29, 2000 ames hills other total net sales 830,657

of the ames store base, b the results of the converted hills stores after their re opening as ames stores and c certain expenses associated with the acquisition of hills, including interest expense on the acquired hills senior notes and a pro rata share of the amortization of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition. the hills column represents a the results of operations for the hills stores during the period that these stores were operated pursuant to the gordon brothers nassi agency agreement, including depreciation and interest expense directly associated with such stores and b hills corporate overhead expenses, principally the canton, ma facility. the other column represents the expenses incurred during the period of remodeling the hills stores for example, pre opening expenses incurred during the conversion or dark period as well as certain other expenses. the unique circumstances under which hills' operations were conducted through the quarter ended may 1, 1999 distort any direct comparison of the principal components of ames' consolidated results for the quarters ended april 29, 2000 and may 1, 1999. in the discussion that follows, ames' net sales, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended april 29, 2000 are compared to the ames' results for the quarter ended may 1, 1999, exclusive of the hills results and other expenses. the comparison of depreciation and amortization expense and interest and debt expense will be on a consolidated basis. ames' net sales increased 263.4 million or 46 in the first quarter of 2000 compared to the prior year's first quarter. this increase is primarily a result of the inclusion of all 151 of the converted hills stores in the ames store base for the entire quarter compared to only 51 stores for two weeks during the quarter ended may 1, 1999. comparable store sales increased 1.2 during the first quarter. gross margin increased 69.8 million or 44 in the first quarter of 2000 from the first quarter of 1999. the increase is a result of the increased number of ames stores, as previously discussed. gross margin as a percentage of sales declined slightly from 27.8 to 27.4 . the decrease was mainly the result of slightly higher markdowns and changes in merchandise mix. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 87.8 million or 55 as a result of the expanded ames store base. expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 27.8 to 29.5 primarily as a result of sales falling short of planned levels. depreciation and amortization expense increased 3.3 million or 23 . the increase resulted primarily from a full quarter of additional depreciation on the remodeling expenditures associated with conversion of the former hills stores. interest expense increased 6.9 million or 58 . the increase is mainly attributed to a higher level of borrowings under our revolving credit facility as well as a full quarter's interest expense for the ames senior notes issued in april of 1999. our estimated annual effective income tax rate for each year was applied to the loss before income taxes for each period to compute a non cash income tax benefit. the income tax benefits are included in current assets in the balance sheet as of april 29, 2000 and may 1, 1999. liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our revolving credit facility, cash from operations and cash on hand. our revolving credit facility, which expires june 20, 2002, provides credit of up to 650 million. borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets. in addition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants if our availability under the credit facility falls below a specified level. during the first quarter we increased our drawings on the credit facility approximately 254.8 million but our availability did not fall below the specified level. our peak borrowing level under the facility during the quarter ended april 29, 2000 was 429.3 million. we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations for the foreseeable future. merchandise inventories increased 156.5 million from january 29, 2000 due primarily to an unexpected sales shortfall during the first quarter and a seasonal merchandise build up. merchandise inventories increased 285.6 million from may 1, 1999 primarily as a result of fully stocking the converted hills stores and changing inventory valuation in approximately two thirds of those stores from liquidation value to cost. trade accounts payable decreased approximately 7 million from january 29, 2000 primarily as a result of a slowdown in merchandise purchases in response to the first quarter sales shortfall. trade accounts payable increased 63.2 million from may 1, 1999 due to the increase in merchandise inventories referenced above. capital expenditures for the thirteen weeks ended april 29, 2000 totaled 40.2 million and for the balance of the year are estimated to be approximately 80.0 million. we adjust our plans for making such expenditures depending on the amount of internally generated funds. net fixed assets increased 19.7 million from january 29, 2000 primarily due to 40.2 million in capital expenditures offset by 19.7 million in depreciation expense. in april 2000, the company consummated its purchase of the leases for seven stores from goldblatt's department stores, inc. for a cash purchase price of 7.6 million. six of the stores are located in chicago, illinois and one is in gary, indiana. beneficial lease rights represent the excess of the fair market value of the acquired hills leases over contract value of those leases. we are amortizing this amount over the terms of the related leases which average approximately 25 years using the straight line method. goodwill is being amortized over 25 years using the straight line method. long term debt as of april 29, 2000 consisted of borrowings under our bank credit facility of 429.3 million, 200.0 million of the ames senior notes issued in april 1999 and 44.5 million of the hills senior notes that remained outstanding after the acquisition. the hills senior notes became direct obligations of ames as a result of the merger of hills into ames. capital lease and financing obligations decreased 4.4 million from january 29, 2000 to april 29, 2000 due primarily to payments made on capital lease obligations. capital lease and financing obligations decreased 4.6 million from may 1, 1999 to april 29, 2000 primarily as result of payments slightly exceeding new capital lease commitments. the net operating loss carryovers remaining after fiscal 1999, subject to any limitations pursuant to internal revenue code sec 382, should offset income on which taxes would otherwise be payable in the next several years. note concerning forward looking statements statements, other than those based on historical
