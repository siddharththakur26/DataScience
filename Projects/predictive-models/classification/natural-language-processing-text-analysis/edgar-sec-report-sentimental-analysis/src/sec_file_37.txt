NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




 
 
 
 
 




Note 1

 
-

 
The financial statements included in this report reflect all
normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the
Corporation’s consolidated financial position at March 31, 2004
and December 31, 2003, and the consolidated results of
operations and the consolidated cash flows for the three-month
periods ended March 31, 2004 and 2003. The unaudited results of
operations for the interim periods reported are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the full year.


 
 
 
 
 




 
 
 
Certain notes and other information have been condensed or
omitted from these interim financial statements. These
statements, therefore, should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes included in
the 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders, which have been
incorporated by reference in the Corporation’s Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2003. Certain information in the
financial statements and notes has been reclassified to conform
with current period presentation.


 
 
 
 
 


Note 2

 
-

 
In 2003, the Corporation took initiatives to reshape its
portfolio of exploration and production assets to reduce costs,
lengthen reserve lives, provide capital for investment and
reduce debt.


 
 
 
 
 




 
 
 
In the first quarter of 2003, the Corporation exchanged its
crude oil producing properties in Colombia (acquired in 2001 as
part of the Triton acquisition), plus $10 million in cash, for
an additional 25% interest in natural gas reserves in the joint
development area of Malaysia and Thailand. The exchange resulted
in a charge to income of $69 million before income taxes, which
the Corporation reported as a loss on asset sale in discontinued
operations in the first quarter of 2003. Discontinued
operations in the first quarter of 2003 also included $18
million (before income taxes) of income from operations prior to
the exchange.


 
 
 
 
 




 
 
 
In the second quarter of 2003, the Corporation sold producing
properties in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, the Jabung Field in Indonesia
and several small United Kingdom fields. Discontinued operations in the
first quarter of 2003 included $41 million before income taxes of
income from operations from these assets.

Note 7

 
-

 
Pre-tax foreign currency losses from continuing operations amounted to $17 million in
the quarter ended March 31, 2004 and $4 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2003.


 
 
 
 
 


Note 8

 
-

 
The Corporation records compensation expense for nonvested common stock awards
(restricted stock) ratably over the vesting period, which is generally five years.
The Corporation uses the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options.
Because the exercise prices of employee stock options equal or exceed the market
price of the stock on the date of grant, the Corporation does not recognize
compensation expense.


 
 
 
 
 




 
 
 
The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of employee
stock options for pro forma disclosure. Using the fair value method, stock option
expense would be recognized over the one-year vesting period. The following pro forma

The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in other
comprehensive income to earnings at the time the hedged transactions are
recognized. Hedging reduced exploration and production results by $118 million
before income taxes in the first quarter of 2004. Hedging reduced exploration and production results by $164 million
before income taxes for the corresponding period of 2003.


 
 
 
 
 




 
 
 
At March 31, 2004, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
included after-tax deferred losses of $329 million ($285 million of
unrealized losses and $44 million of realized losses) related to crude
oil and natural gas contracts used as hedges. In its energy marketing
business, the Corporation has entered into cash flow hedges to fix the
purchase prices of natural gas, heating oil, residual fuel oil and
electricity related to contracted future sales. At March 31, 2004, the
net after-tax deferred gain in accumulated other comprehensive income
from these hedge contracts was $48 million.

On January 1, 2003, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations as required by
FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Using the accounting method required by FAS No. 143, the
Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations associated with
long-lived assets in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred. The Corporation capitalizes the
associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. The cumulative effect of
this change in the first quarter of 2003 was a credit to income of $7 million or $.08 per share, basic and diluted.

Item 2.

 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition.




Overview
          The Corporation had strong first quarter 2004 earnings of
$281 million. Earnings from exploration and production were $207
million in the first quarter of 2004, reflecting higher crude oil
and natural gas prices and lower first quarter costs. Refining and
marketing earnings were $112 million for the first quarter of
2004, resulting from favorable refining margins and high
utilization rates. The first quarter results may not be indicative
of future operating results.



          The
Corporation continues to progress its twelve development projects. The Llano Field is expected to commence production in
the second quarter and the installation of the offshore pipeline
for the joint development area of Malaysia-Thailand is proceeding
as planned. In Equatorial Guinea, the plan of development for the
Northern Block G fields is expected to be submitted to the
government in June.



          With regard to Libya, the United States Government’s easing
of sanctions should allow the Corporation and its partners to
further advance plans to return to our operations there.
Negotiations regarding the terms of re-entry are underway.



Results of Operations
          Net income for the first quarter of 2004 amounted to $281
million compared with $176 million in the first quarter of 2003.
Income in the first quarter of 2004 includes a net gain from an
asset sale of $19 million and an income tax benefit of $13 million
resulting from the completion of a prior year United States income
tax audit. Results for the first quarter of 2003 included a net
gain from an asset sale of $31 million. The after-tax results by
major operating activity for the three-months ended March 31, 2004
and 2003 were as follows (in millions, except per share data):

Comparison of Results
          In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain
transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews
segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in
its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that
after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in
earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather
than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by
applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to
pre-tax amounts.



Exploration and Production
          Exploration and production earnings amounted to $207 million in
the first quarter of 2004 compared with $120 million in the first
quarter of 2003. These earnings include after-tax gains on asset
sales of $19 million and $31 million ($19 million and $47 million
before income taxes) in the first quarters of 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The gain in the first quarter of 2004 reflects the sale
of an office building in Aberdeen, Scotland. The gain in the first
quarter of 2003 is from the sale of the Corporation’s 1.5% interest in
the Trans Alaska Pipeline System.



          After considering the gains on asset sales described above, the
remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily
attributable to changes in selling prices, sales volumes and operating
costs and exploration expenses, as discussed below.

          Selling prices: Higher average selling prices of crude oil and
natural gas increased exploration and production revenues by
approximately $78 million in the first quarter of 2004 compared with
the same period of 2003. The Corporation’s average selling prices,
including the effects of hedging, were as follows:

          The after-tax impact of crude oil and U.S. natural gas hedges in
the first quarter of 2004 was an opportunity cost of $73 million
compared with an opportunity cost of $102 million in the prior
year period.



          Sales and production volumes: The change in crude oil and
natural gas sales volumes in the first quarter of 2004 compared to the
first quarter of 2003 did not materially affect earnings from
continuing operations, however, crude oil and natural gas production
was lower. The Corporation’s oil and gas production, on a barrel of
oil equivalent basis, decreased to 346,000 barrels per day in the
first quarter of 2004 from 421,000 barrels per day in 2003.
Approximately 60% of this decline was due to asset sales and exchanges
in 2003. The remainder was due to maintenance and natural decline.
The Corporation anticipates that its average production for the full
year of 2004 will be approximately 6% below the first quarter level.
The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production in the first quarter
of each year was as follows (in thousands):

          Operating costs and exploration expenses: Operating costs and
exploration expenses from continuing operations decreased by
approximately $88 million in the first quarter of 2004 compared with
the corresponding period in the prior year. Depreciation, depletion
and amortization charges were lower in the first quarter of 2004
compared with 2003, reflecting lower production volumes and lower unit
cost per barrel from changes in the mix of producing fields.
Production expenses decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2004
reflecting lower production volumes. Exploration expense was also
lower in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily because of lower dry hole
costs.



          Other: After-tax foreign currency losses amounted to $3 million
($13 million before income taxes) in the first quarter of 2004
compared with losses of $1 million ($3 million before income taxes) in
the first quarter of 2003. The pre-tax amounts of foreign currency
losses are included in non-operating income (expense) in the income
statement.



          The effective income tax rate for exploration and production
operations in the first quarter of 2004 was 46% compared to 56% in the
first quarter of 2003.



          The Corporation’s future exploration and production earnings may
be impacted by volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and
natural gas, reserve and production changes and changes in tax rates.

Results of Operations (Continued)
Refining and Marketing
          Earnings from refining and marketing activities amounted to $112
million in the first quarter of 2004 compared with $136 million in the
corresponding period of 2003. The Corporation’s downstream operations
include HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a 50% owned refining joint venture
with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), accounted
for on the equity method. Additional refining and marketing
activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy
marketing and trading operations.



          HOVENSA: The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income was $51
million in the first quarter of 2004 compared with income of $50
million in the first quarter of 2003. HOVENSA’s total crude runs
amounted to 495,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2004 and
397,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2003. Crude runs in
the first quarter of 2003 were reduced as a result of interruptions in
crude oil deliveries from Venezuela. Refining margins continued to be
high in the first quarter of 2004 and sales volumes increased. Income
taxes on the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s results were offset by
available loss carryforwards.



          Earnings from refining and marketing activities also include
interest income on the note received from PDVSA at the formation of
the joint venture. Interest on the PDVSA note amounted to $7 million
in the first quarter of 2004 and $8 million in the same period of
2003. Interest income is recorded in non-operating income in the
income statement.



          Retail, Energy Marketing and Other: Results of retail gasoline
operations were lower in the first quarter of 2004 compared with the
corresponding period of 2003 reflecting higher wholesale fuel prices,
although sales volumes increased. Energy marketing activities had
lower earnings in the first quarter of 2004 due to decreased margins
compared with 2003. Results of the Port Reading refining facility
improved in the first quarter of 2004 reflecting higher margins than
in same period of 2003. Total refined product sales volumes were
44 million barrels in the first quarter of 2004, an increase of
5% compared with
the corresponding period of 2003.



          The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives.
The Corporation also takes trading positions in addition to its
hedging program. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading
activities, including its share of the earnings of the trading
partnership amounted to income of $15 million in the first quarter of
2004 and $18 million in the first quarter of 2003. Before income
taxes, the trading income was $24 million in the first quarter of 2004
and $29 million in the first quarter of 2003.

Results of Operations (Continued)
          Refining and marketing earnings will likely continue to be
volatile reflecting competitive industry conditions and supply and
demand factors, including the effects of weather.



Corporate
          After-tax corporate expenses amounted to $2 million in the first
quarter of 2004 compared with $20 million in same period of 2003. The
results for the first quarter of 2004 include a non-cash income tax
benefit of $13 million resulting from the completion of a prior year
United States income tax audit. After-tax corporate expenses for 2004
are estimated to be in the range of $60 to $70 million excluding the
tax benefit.



Interest
          After-tax
interest totaled $36 million in the first quarter of 2004
compared with $46 million in the first quarter of 2003. The corresponding
amounts before income taxes were $57 million in the first quarter of 2004
and $74 million in the first quarter of 2003. Interest incurred in 2004
was lower than in 2003 because of lower average outstanding debt.
Capitalized interest was $16 million in the first quarter of 2004 and
$13 million in the first quarter of 2003. After-tax interest expense
for the full year of 2004 is anticipated to be approximately 15% below
the 2003 level.



Discontinued Operations
          In the first quarter of 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude
oil producing properties in Colombia (acquired in 2001 as part of the
Triton acquisition), plus $10 million in cash, for an additional 25%
interest in Block A-18 in the joint development area of Malaysia and
Thailand (JDA). The exchange resulted in a net after-tax charge to
income of $60 million ($69 million before income taxes) in
discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2003. Discontinued
operations in the first quarter of 2003 also included $13 million ($18
million before income taxes) of income from operations prior to the
exchange. The JDA production facilities are complete, but production
cannot commence until the purchasers of the gas complete the
construction of a natural gas pipeline. The Corporation anticipates
that production will begin in the second half of 2005.



          In the second quarter of 2003, the Corporation sold Gulf of
Mexico shelf properties, the Jabung Field in Indonesia and several
small United Kingdom fields. Discontinued operations in the first
quarter of 2003 also included $26 million of income ($41 million
before income taxes) from operations of these assets.

Results of Operations (Continued)
Sales and Other Operating Revenues
          Sales and other operating revenues increased by 6% in the first
quarter of 2004 compared with the corresponding period of 2003. This
increase principally reflects increased sales volumes of refined
products partially offset by decreased sales of purchased gas in
energy marketing. The increase in cost of goods sold also reflects
the change in sales volumes of refined products.



Liquidity and Capital Resources
          Overview: Cash flows from operating activities, including changes
in operating assets and liabilities, totaled $394 million in the first
quarter of 2004. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the
first quarter of 2004 totaled $557 million, an increase of $39 million
from year-end. At March 31, 2004, the Corporation’s debt to
capitalization ratio was 41.7% compared to 42.5% at December 31, 2003.
Total debt was $3,928 million at March 31, 2004 and $3,941 million at
December 31, 2003. The Corporation has hedged the selling prices of a
significant portion of its crude oil and natural gas production in
2004 and 2005 to help generate a level of cash flow that will meet
operating and capital commitments.



          Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Net cash provided by
operating activities, including changes in operating assets and
liabilities, totaled $394 million in the first quarter of 2004
compared with $488 million in the first quarter of 2003.



          Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Capital expenditures in
the first three months of 2004 were $364 million of which $352 million
related to exploration and production activities. Capital
expenditures in the first three months of 2003 were $341 million,
including $321 million for exploration and production. The
Corporation invested $65 million in short-term investments during the
quarter.



          Cash Flows from Financing Activities: The Corporation reduced
debt by $13 million during the first quarter of 2004. During the
remainder of 2004, $63 million of debt becomes due and $60 million is
due in 2005. Debt reduction in the first quarter of 2003 was $143
million. Dividends paid were $67 million in the first quarter of 2004
compared with $54 million in the same period of the prior year. The
increase was because of dividends paid on the 7% preferred stock
issued in the fourth quarter of 2003.



          Future Capital Requirements and Resources: Capital expenditures
excluding acquisitions, if any, for the remainder of 2004 are
currently estimated to be approximately $1.2 billion. The Corporation
anticipates that available cash and cash flow from operations will
fund these expenditures. At March 31, 2004, the Corporation has an
undrawn facility of $1.5 billion under its committed revolving credit
agreement and has additional unused lines of credit of $206 million
under uncommitted arrangements with banks. The Corporation’s revolving
credit agreement expires in 2006 and the Corporation expects it will
be able to arrange a new committed facility prior to expiration, if
required. The Corporation also has a

shelf registration under which it may issue
$825 million of additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or
preferred stock.

          Loan agreement covenants allow the Corporation to borrow an
additional $5.2 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets
at March 31, 2004. At period end, the amount that can be borrowed
under the loan agreements for the payment of dividends is $1.9
billion.


          Prior to June 30, 1986, the Corporation had extensive exploration and
production operations in Libya; however, it was required to suspend
participation in these operations because of U.S. Government
sanctions. The book value of the Corporation’s Libyan assets was
written-off in connection with the cessation of operations. On
February 24, 2004, the Corporation received U.S. Government
authorization to negotiate and enter into an executory agreement with
the government of Libya that would define the terms for resuming
active participation in the Libyan properties. On April 29, 2004, the
U.S. Government lifted most of the sanctions imposed on Libya. It has
also taken the necessary steps to have the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of
1976 terminated by Congress with respect to Libya. As a result, the
Corporation and its partners will be able to resume operations in
Libya if they are able to reach a successful conclusion to their
ongoing commercial negotiations. If these negotiations are
successful, management anticipates capital expenditures will likely
increase over the current plan. Production and reserves would also
increase.



          Credit Ratings: During the first quarter of 2004, two credit
rating agencies downgraded their ratings of the Corporation’s debt.
One of the revised ratings was below investment grade. Consequently,
the Corporation’s cash margin or collateral requirements under certain
contracts with hedging and trading counterparties and certain lenders
increased. Outstanding letters of credit increased to $516 million at
March 31, 2004 compared with $229 million at December 31, 2003. This
increase relates to higher commodity prices and the additional
collateral required because of the lower rating. All hedging and
trading counterparty liabilities are recorded on the balance sheet.
If an additional rating agency were to reduce its credit rating below
investment grade, the incremental margin requirements at March 31,
2004 would not be material.



          Other: In connection with the sale of six vessels in 2002, the
Corporation agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate on these
vessels for up to five years. The support agreement requires that if
the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is less than
the stipulated support rate in the agreement, the Corporation will pay
to the buyer the difference between the contracted rate and the
stipulated rate. The balance in the charter support reserve at January
1, 2004 was $32 million. During the first three months of 2004, the
Corporation paid $1 million of charter support, reducing the reserve
to $31 million.

PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
          At December 31, 2003, the Corporation had an accrual of $38
million for severance and leased office space in London. During the
first quarter of 2004, $4 million of additional pre-tax costs were
accrued and $5 million of payments were made. The March 31, 2004
accrual for severance and office lease costs is $37 million.
Additional accruals for severance and lease costs of approximately $10
million before income taxes are anticipated over the next several
quarters. The estimated annual savings from this 2003 cost reduction
initiative is approximately $50 million before income taxes.



          Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Corporation has leveraged
lease financings not included in its balance sheet, primarily related
to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net
present value of these financings is $459 million at March 31, 2004.
The Corporation’s March 31, 2004 debt to capitalization ratio would
increase from 41.7% to 44.4% if the lease financings were included.



          The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSA’s
crude oil purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of
the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude
oil purchased and related prices. At March 31, 2004, the guarantee
totaled $185 million. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to
a maximum of $40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to
meet its senior debt obligations.



          In the first quarter of 2004, the Corporation guaranteed its
share of an investee’s borrowings to finance construction of an oil
pipeline. The amount guaranteed is approximately $39 million. The
guarantee will be in place through the end of the pipeline’s
construction, which is expected to be approximately two years.



Market Risk Disclosure
          In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed
to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil,
natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes
in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures
that follow, these operations are referred to as non-trading
activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally
through a 50% voting interest in a trading partnership. These
activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to
the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products.



          Instruments: The Corporation uses forward commodity contracts,
foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps and options in the
Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are
widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms.


18



Table of Contents

PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
Market Risk Disclosure (Continued)
          Quantitative Measures: The Corporation uses value-at-risk to
monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non-trading
activities. The value-at-risk model uses historical simulation and
the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at
a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second
order sensitivities for options. The potential change in fair value
based on commodity price risk is presented in the non-trading and
trading sections below.



          Non-Trading: The Corporation’s non-trading activities include
hedging of crude oil and natural gas production. Futures and swaps
are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the Corporation’s
future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part
of the Corporation’s selling prices. As of March 31, the Corporation
has open hedge positions equal to 70% of its estimated 2004 worldwide
crude oil production for the period from April 1 to December 31, 2004
and 55% of its estimated 2005 worldwide crude oil production. The
average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) related open
hedge positions is $27.02 in 2004 and $26.25 in 2005. The average
price for Brent crude oil related open hedge positions is $25.00 in
2004 and $24.87 in 2005. Approximately 18% of the Corporation’s
hedges are WTI related and the remainder are Brent. In addition, the
Corporation has 24,000 barrels of oil per day of Brent related
production hedged from 2006 through 2012 at an average price of $26.20
per barrel. The majority of these hedges cover a portion of our
planned production from Equatorial Guinea. A portion of the 2006
through 2012 hedges was transacted subsequent to the quarter end. The
Corporation also has hedged 35% of its remaining 2004 United States
natural gas production at an average price of $5.04 per Mcf. As
market conditions change, the Corporation may adjust its hedge
percentages.



          The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined
petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses
futures and swaps to fix the purchase prices of commodities to be sold
under fixed-price sales contracts.



          The Corporation estimates that at March 31, 2004, the
value-at-risk for commodity related derivatives that are settled in
cash and used in non-trading activities was $52 million ($44 million
at December 31, 2003). The results may vary from time to time as
hedge levels change.



          Trading: The trading partnership in which the Corporation has a
50% voting interest trades energy commodities and derivatives. The
accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the
Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own
account. These strategies include proprietary position management and
trading to enhance the potential return on assets. The information
that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the
Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts.

Market Risk Disclosure (Continued)
          In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in
crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices, primarily in North
America and Europe. Trading positions include futures, forwards,
swaps and options. In some cases, physical purchase and sale
contracts are used as trading instruments and are included in the
trading results.



          Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at
the time of sale. Derivative trading transactions are marked-to-market
and are reflected in income currently. Total realized losses for the
first three months of 2004 amounted to $8 million ($36 million of
realized losses for the first three months of 2003). The following

          The Corporation uses observable market values for determining the fair value of its trading instruments. The majority of valuations
are based on actively quoted market values. In cases where actively quoted prices are not available, other external sources are
used which incorporate information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets and other
market fundamental analysis. Internal estimates are based on internal models incorporating underlying market information such as
commodity volatilities and correlations. The Corporation’s risk management department regularly compares valuations to independent
sources and models. The sources of fair value at March 31, 2004 follow (in millions):

Legal Proceedings




          As disclosed in Registrant’s 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, purported class actions consolidated under a
complaint captioned: In re Amerada Hess Securities Litigation were
pending in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
against Registrant and certain executive officers and former executive
officers of the Registrant alleging that these individuals sold shares
of the Registrant’s common stock in advance of the Registrant’s
acquisition of Triton Energy Limited (“Triton”) in 2001 in violation
of federal securities laws. In April 2003, the Registrant and the
other defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a
claim and failure to plead fraud with particularity. On March 31,
2004, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the
complaint. The plaintiffs were granted leave to file an amended
complaint by May 19, 2004.
