needs of its customers, u haul must maintain a large inventory of fixed asset rental items. at march 31, 2001, net property, plant and equipment represented approximately 63.1 of total assets from non insurance operations and approximately 40.2 of consolidated assets. in fiscal year 2001, gross capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were 358.9 million, as compared to 417.6 million and 298.5 million in fiscal years 2000 and 1999, respectively. these expenditures primarily reflect the replacement of certain rental trucks and trailers. the capital needs required to fund these acquisitions were funded with internally generated funds from operations and lease financings. during each of the fiscal years ending march 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, u haul estimates gross capital expenditures will average approximately 232 million primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation. this level of capital expenditures, combined with a potential range of 77.5 175 million in annual long term debt maturities, are expected to create annual average funding needs of approximately 333 408 million. management estimates that u haul will fund 100 of these requirements with leases and internally generated funds, including proceeds from the disposition of older trucks and other asset sales. consolidated net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 126.1 million, 237.7 million and 159.5 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. details by material segment follows moving and storage operations cash provided by

decrease in intercompany payable. the increase from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2000 is partially due to an increase in net income. 15 real estate operations cash provided by operating activities was 50.5 million, 24.8 million and 38.0 million in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. the increase in fiscal year 2001, is due to an increase in intercompany payable. this is due to dividends paid related to the sale of property. the decrease in fiscal year 2000, is due to a decrease in the intercompany payable. property and casualty cash provided used by operating activities was 21.1 million, 11.1 million and 21.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the 2000 to 1999 change resulted from increased premium collections and funds withheld, offset by increased loss and loss adjustment expense payments and policy acquisition costs associated with new business production. the 1999 to 1998 change resulted from the increased funds withheld liability, decreased paid losses recoverable and a smaller decrease in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. this was offset by increased premiums and agents' balances and the intercompany receivable due from affiliates. repwest's cash and cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio were 17.0 million, 6.0 million and 6.1 million at december 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. this balance reflects funds in transition from maturity proceeds to long term investments. this level of liquid assets, combined with budgeted cash flow, is adequate to meet periodic needs. capital and operating budgets allow repwest to schedule cash needs in accordance with investment and underwriting proceeds. 16 life insurance cash provided by operating activities was 8.7 million, 22.2 million and 34.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2000 and 1999 relates to paid loss experience. in 2000, cash flows provided by financing activities were 14.7 million, 3.2 million and 32.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. cash flows from deferred annuity sales increase investment contract deposits, which are a component of financing activities, as well as the purchase of fixed maturities, which are a component of investing activities. the increase in 2000 from 1999 is due to a higher ratio of annuity deposits versus withdrawals, the opposite occurred in 1999 compared to 1998. oxford's primary sources of cash are premiums, receipts from interest sensitive products and investment income. the primary uses of cash are operating costs and benefit payments to policyholders. matching the investment portfolio to the cash flow demands of the types of insurance being written is an important consideration. benefit and claim statistics are continually monitored to provide projections of future cash requirements. in addition to cash flows from operating and financing activities, a substantial amount of liquid funds is available through oxford's short term portfolio. short term investments amounted to 45.0 million, 30.7 million and 63.4 million at december 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. management believes that the overall sources of liquidity will continue to meet foreseeable cash needs. consolidated stockholder's

increased earnings. the increase in fiscal year 2000 was due to earnings. 17 property and casualty repwest maintains a diversified securities investment portfolio, primarily in bonds at varying maturity levels with 88.0 of the fixed income securities consisting of investment grade securities. the maturity distribution is designed to provide sufficient liquidity to meet future cash needs. current liquidity remains strong, with current invested assets equal to 81.8 of total liabilities. the liability for reported and unreported losses are based upon both repwest's historical and industry averages. unpaid loss adjustment expenses are based on historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid. unpaid loss and loss expenses are not discounted. repwest's stockholder's equity was 192.1 million, 208.5 million and 211.4 million at december 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the decrease from 1999 to 2000 is a result of an operating loss and a change in market value for the available for sale investment portfolio. repwest considers current stockholder's equity to be adequate to support future growth and absorb unforeseen risk events. repwest does not use debt or equity issues to increase capital and therefore has no exposure to capital market conditions. life insurance oxford's stockholder's equity was 99.8 million, 88.1 million and 93.6

to 1999 was due to the change in market value for the available for sale investment portfolio offset by earnings. oxford did not pay dividends to its parent during 2000, 1999 or 1998. insurance operations applicable laws and regulations of the state of arizona require repwest and oxford to maintain minimum capital determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. such amount is 1.0 million and 0.4 million, for repwest and oxford, respectively. in addition, the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders by insurance companies domiciled in the state of arizona is limited. any dividend in excess of the limit requires prior regulatory approval. statutory surplus which can be distributed as dividends without regulatory approval is 11.7 million and 0.7 million for repwest and oxford, respectively at december 31, 2000. these restrictions are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the company to meet its cash obligations. oxford issued a surplus note to amerco on december 31, 1998 for 10.0 million. approval by the arizona department of insurance is required prior to payment of principal and interest. credit agreements amerco's operations are funded by various credit and financing arrangements, including unsecured long term borrowings, unsecured medium term notes and revolving lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks.

and 12.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. the decrease in 2000 from both 1999 and 1998 was due to write downs of fixed maturity investments whose declines in
