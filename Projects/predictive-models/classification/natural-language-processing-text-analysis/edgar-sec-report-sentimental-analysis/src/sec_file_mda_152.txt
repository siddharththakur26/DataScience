biospherix and infospherix. biospherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications. infospherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry, with substantially all of infospherix revenue generated from government customers. 11 biospherix engages in product development, notably tagatose. the company s current focus is on the non food use of tagatose, which we will market under the name naturlose . our principal efforts have been to explore whether naturlose is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes. in april 2007, the company commenced a phase 3 trial for this purpose. infospherix has developed a niche in providing campground and other reservation services via its reserveworld business line and is one of only two major suppliers of campground reservation services in the u.s. reservation contracts make up over 50 of the company s revenue. the reservation services contracts have revenue streams that are historically greater in the spring and summer months when vacation planning is more prevalent. these reservation contracts have certain fixed costs that continue throughout the year such as depreciation, telephone and computer related service and maintenance contracts, and minimum staffing requirements. these contracts also incur certain costs in advance of the peak seasons in order to staff up and train the work force that will be needed during the peak seasons. on january 23, 2007, the company concluded its long standing national park service contract. the national park service contract contributed approximately 4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended december 31, 2006 and 2005. on june 25, 2007, the company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the infospherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval. the sale will allow spherix to focus all of its efforts on the biospherix division s biotechnology products, with the principal focus on the commercialization of naturlose. the sale is subject to the approval of the company s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of the company s august 15, 2007 annual meeting. the operations of infospherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations. results of operations for the three and six months ended june 30, 2007 and 2006 selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses s,g a for the three and six months ended june 30, 2007, increased 386,000 and 494,000 over those of the same periods in 2006. the increase in the second quarter was primarily the result of an executive bonus of 150,000 awarded to the ceo for past performance, and an increase in accounting costs of approximately 120,000 related to the increased complexity of the company s tax reporting requirements including the implementation of fin 48. the increase in s,g a costs for the six months ended june 30, 2007 over those of the prior year also included approximately 120,000 in costs related to the services of an investment banker prior to the company s decision to sell infospherix. excluded from the above s,g a numbers is approximately 170,000 in consulting and legal costs related to the sale of infospherix that have been classified as part of the costs of the discontinued operations. these costs were incurred in the second quarter of 2007, following the decision to sell infospherix. research and development the company s r d expenditures have significantly increased between years as a direct result of the company s phase 3 clinical trial in the use of naturlose for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, which began this year. the primary focus of biospherix s research and development r d activities for the six months ended june 30, 2007, has been on the planning and preparation of a phase 3 trial. the company has completed an initial dose range finding study, and the recruitment of patients for the trial, which will take place in australia and the united states, is ongoing. the first participants began the phase 3 clinical trial in april 2007. more than 400 subjects from the united states and abroad, representing the demographic mix in the u.s., will receive oral doses of naturlose to test its ability to treat type 2 diabetes. a phase 3 clinical trial, which gathers evidence regarding effectiveness and safety, is needed to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of new drugs proposed to the fda. the company believes its chances for a successful outcome are enhanced by the widely demonstrated safety of the product, lack of safety being the primary cause for failure of most drug candidates. testing is scheduled to finish in mid 2009. if the trial is successful, it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application nda to the fda. the fda will then likely take up to a year to respond to the nda. accordingly, we do not expect fda approval before mid 2010 at the earliest. 12 in 2005, the company contracted with the university of maryland school of dentistry to conduct a human clinical trial on the oral anti plaque efficacy of naturlose. the study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is sorbitol, a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products. the study suggested ways of modifying the naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction. such modifications have been made, and the company has arranged with the university of maryland school of dentistry to conduct a trial of naturlose toothpaste formulated by the company in an attempt to establish an anti plaque and anti gingivitis claim for the toothpaste. the clinical trial started in early 2007. infospherix three months ended june 30, six months ended june 30, 2007 2006 2007 2006 revenue 6,490,000 7,582,000 11,837,000 13,501,000 direct cost and operating expense 5,471,000 5,684,000 10,387,000 10,602,000 gross margin 1,019,000 1,898,000 1,450,000 2,899,000 revenue for the three and six months ended june 30, 2007, decreased 1.1 million 14 and 1.7 million 12 from the same periods in 2006 due to the completion of the national park service contract, which concluded on january 23, 2007. reductions from the direct costs associated with the national park service contract were off set by increased costs under the new michigan contract and additional costs incurred under the contracts transferred from the former south dakota facility to the new facility in indiana. the national park service contract contributed approximately 4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended december 31, 2006 and 2005. liquidity and capital resources, consolidated on june 25, 2007, as part of the definitive purchase agreement to sell infospherix, the company agreed to terminate the infospherix line of credit with bank of america the bank prior to closing. accordingly, the company subsequently closed the line of credit with the bank. the infospherix bank line of credit was established on march 31, 2006. the line of credit provided for borrowings up to 1.5 million, was collateralized by the subsidiary s accounts receivables and equipment, and contained covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to ebitda ratios. the interest rate under the agreement was based on the libor daily floating rate plus 3 approximately 8.5 at june 30, 2007 . the company had no outstanding borrowings under the agreement at june 30, 2007, and the total amount available for future advances to the subsidiary was 1.5 million under the agreement. working capital as of june 30, 2007, was 7.8 million, which represents a 3.1 million decrease from working capital of 10.9 million at december 31, 2006. the decrease in working capital was largely related to the company s phase 3 clinical trial costs and increased costs related to the anticipated sale of infospherix. spherix expects to expend up to 5 million over the next year in costs related to the phase 3 clinical trial and other r d activity. the clinical trial is expected to take at least two years to complete. the company intends to finance the biospherix activities through proceeds from the sale of the infospherix subsidiary and proceeds from possible future issuance of additional common stock. the company also intends to seek pharmaceutical partners to assist in completing development of the biospherix products. cash flow for the six months ended june 30, 2007, reflects a net cash outflow of 2.8 million, consisting of 2.4 million used in operating activities, 1.2 million used in investing activities, and 768,000 provided by financing activities. the increase in cash used by operating activities in 2007 from that of the prior year is primarily related to the cost of the phase 3 clinical trial. the change in cash used in investing activities is related to one time proceeds of 2 million from the maturity of a certificate of deposit in the prior year. cash flows from financing activities in 2006 included proceeds from the issuance of warrants. 13 trends and outlooks biospherix on june 25, 2007, the company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the infospherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval, for 17 million 15 million at closing and 2 million following a 15 month escrow period . the sale will allow spherix to focus all of its efforts on the biospherix division s biotechnology products. biospherix s primary emphasis is on a phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate that naturlose is a successful treatment for type 2 diabetes. the trial began in april 2007, and testing is scheduled to finish in mid 2009. if the trial is successful, it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application nda to the fda. the fda will then likely take up to a year to respond to the nda. accordingly, we do not expect fda approval before mid to late 2010 at the earliest. the company has decided to conduct the entire phase 3 clinical trial for type 2 diabetes in the united states and according has terminating the australian trials. the change is intended to simplify the logistics of managing the trial. costs of conducting the phase 3 trial have substantially increased as we have obtained further direction from the fda concerning the processes to be employed in the trial. the company expects to spend up to 5 million in r d costs over the next year. the company intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the infospherix subsidiary to fund the phase 3 trial. if the sale is not concluded, the company will need to reassess continuation of the tests in view of the increased costs of the tests and the expected follow on costs in pursuit of fda approval. a human clinical trial on the oral anti plaque efficacy of naturlose was conducted by the company at the university of maryland school of dentistry. the trial started in early 2007 and was completed in july. the company expects to receive the results later this year. spherix has subsequently launched a health sciences consulting business line to provide technical and regulatory consulting services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. infospherix as noted above, on june 25, 2007, the company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the infospherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval, for 17 million 15 million at closing and 2 million following a 15 month escrow period . the company concluded the national park service contract on january 23, 2007. the national park service contract contributed approximately 4 million in revenue for each of the years ended december 31, 2006 and 2005. the loss of the national park service contract will have an adverse effect on the company s financial results in comparison to the prior year. since 1998, infospherix has grown its government park reservation business from one contract to 17 government reservation contracts. infospherix s reservation business accounted for over 60 of the company s revenue in 2006 and 2005, and over 50 for the three months ended march 31, 2007. infospherix is now one of only two major suppliers of government campground reservation services in the u.s. on february 6, 2007, infospherix signed an agreement to lease 32,423 square feet of facility space in frostburg, maryland effective december 1, 2007, for use as a call center to replace the existing cumberland, maryland facility. in august 2007, infospherix signed a ten year lease to rent 13,338 square feet of facility space in clarksburg, maryland, for use as an administrative office for infospherix. the target commencement date for the new lease is november 1, 2007. in connection with the signing of the above lease, spherix also signed a lease termination agreement on its beltsville facility. under the lease termination agreement, spherix will pay a termination fee of 475,000 and the termination date is to be effective with the commencement of the clarksburg lease. the company will cease to have any continuing obligations under the frostburg, maryland, or clarksburg, maryland, leases upon completion of the sale of infospherix. the company will relocate to a smaller facility upon termination of the beltsville lease. 14
