item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the normal course of business, amerco is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. amerco manages such exposure by the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. amerco does not enter into leveraged financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations. amerco's objective is to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt. amerco uses interest rate swap agreements to provide for matching the gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction. see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. a fluctuation of the interest rate by 100 basis points would change amerco's interest expense by 1.1 million. foreign currency exchange rate risk amerco's earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of foreign currency exchange rates. approximately 2.0 of amerco's revenue is generated in canada. the result of a uniform 10 change in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the canadian dollar would not be material. amerco does not typically hedge any foreign currency risk since the exposure is not considered material.
