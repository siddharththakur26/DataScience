item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the three months ended september 30, 2001 and 2000 summary amr's net loss for the three months ended september 30, 2001 was 414 million, or 2.68 loss per share, as compared to income before extraordinary loss of 322 million, or 1.96 per share diluted, for the same period in 2000. amr's operating loss for the third quarter of 2001 was 558 million, compared to operating income of 572 million for the third quarter of 2000. on september 11, 2001, two of american's aircraft were hijacked and destroyed in terrorist attacks on the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon in northern virginia. on the same day, two united air lines aircraft were also hijacked and used in terrorist attacks. in response to the terrorist attacks, the federal aviation administration faa issued a federal ground stop order on september 11, 2001, prohibiting all flights to, from, and within the united states. airports did not reopen until september 13, 2001 except for washington reagan national airport, which was partially reopened on october 4, 2001 . the company was able to operate only a portion of its scheduled flights for several days thereafter. when flights were permitted to resume, passenger traffic and yields on the company's flights were significantly lower than prior to the attacks. as a result, the company announced that it would reduce its operating schedule to approximately 80 percent of the schedule it flew prior to september 11, 2001. for additional information related to the september 11, 2001 events, see footnote 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. in addition, as discussed in footnote 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, on april 9, 2001, the company purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of trans world airlines, inc. twa . accordingly, the operating results of twa have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the three month period ended september 30, 2001. amr's third quarter 2000 results from continuing operations include the effect of a labor disruption at one of the company's major competitors which positively impacted the company's net earnings by an estimated 0.22 to 0.28 per share diluted. the company's revenues decreased 440 million, or 8.4 percent, in the third quarter of 2001 versus the same period last year. excluding twa's revenues for the third quarter of 2001, the company's revenues would have decreased by approximately 1.1 billion versus the same period last year. during the third quarter of 2001, the company's revenues, yield, revenue passenger miles and available seat miles were severely impacted by the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, a worsening of the u.s. economy that had already been dampening the demand for travel both domestically and internationally prior to the september 11, 2001 events, the reduced operating schedule, business travel restrictions imposed by numerous companies as a result of the september 11, 2001 attacks, and increased fare sale activity occurring subsequent to the september 11 attacks to encourage passengers to resume flying. the company estimates the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to have negatively impacted the company's revenues by approximately 550 million to 650 million for the three months ended september 30, 2001. american's passenger revenues decreased by 21.6 percent, or 950 million. american's yield the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile of 12.22 cents decreased by 12.1 percent compared to the same period in 2000. domestic yields decreased 15.9 percent from the third quarter of 2000. international yields decreased 3.9 percent, primarily due to a decrease of 9.0 percent and 6.2 percent in european and pacific yields, respectively, partially offset by an increase of approximately 1.6 percent in latin american yields. american's traffic or revenue passenger miles rpms decreased 10.8 percent to 28.2 billion miles for the quarter ended september 30, 2001. american's capacity or available seat miles asms of 38.9 billion miles decreased 6.0 percent compared to the third quarter of 2000. as a result, american's load factor dropped 4 points year over year. american's domestic traffic decreased 11.7 percent on a capacity decrease of 6.5 percent while international traffic decreased 9.1 percent on a capacity decrease of 5.1 percent. international activity included a 10.3 percent decrease in traffic to latin america on a capacity decrease of 8.9 percent, a 9.4 percent decrease in traffic to europe on a capacity decrease of 3.9 percent, and a 2.8 percent decrease in traffic to the pacific on a capacity increase of 9.6 percent. twa's passenger revenues were 591 million for the third quarter of 2001. twa's traffic was 5.4 billion rpms while capacity was 8 billion asms. 13 16 results of operations continued amr eagle's passenger revenues decreased 13.3 percent, or 52 million. the decrease in passenger revenues resulted from a 10.0 percent decrease in passenger yield and a 3.6 percent decrease in traffic. cargo revenues decreased 25 million, or 13.7 percent, due primarily to the impact of the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the softening of the u.s. economy. the company's operating expenses increased 14.7 percent, or approximately 690 million, and included approximately 771 million related to twa's operations for the third quarter 2001. in addition to the specific explanations provided below, the significant decline in passenger traffic resulting from the terrorist acts of september 11, 2001 caused a favorable impact on certain passenger related operating expenses, including aircraft fuel, other rentals and landing fees, commissions to agents and food service. american's cost per asm increased 7.6 percent to 11.21 cents, excluding the impact of the third quarter 2001 special charges and u.s. government grant. the increase in american's cost per asm was driven partially by a reduction in asms due to the company's more room throughout coach program. adjusted for this program, american's cost per asm grew approximately 5.8 percent, excluding the impact of the special charges and u.s. government grant. wages, salaries and benefits increased 23.9 percent, or 412 million, and included approximately 313 million related to the addition of twa. the remaining increase of approximately 99 million related primarily to an increase in the average number of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the company's labor contracts. during the third quarter of 2001, the company recorded approximately 100 million in additional wages, salaries and benefits related to the company's new or tentative labor contracts. this was mostly offset by a 98 million decrease in the provision for profit sharing as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. aircraft fuel expense increased 19.8 percent, or 128 million, and included approximately 117 million related to the addition of twa. the increase in aircraft fuel expense was due to a 5.3 percent increase in the company's average price per gallon and a 12.2 percent increase in the company's fuel consumption, including twa. depreciation and amortization expense increased 19.9 percent, or 61 million, due primarily to the addition of new aircraft and an increase of approximately 30 million related to twa. maintenance, materials and repairs increased 19.4 percent, or 54 million, and included approximately 38 million related to twa. the remaining increase was due primarily to an increase in engine volumes at the company's maintenance bases. other rentals and landing fees increased 73 million, or 29.2 percent, primarily due to the addition of twa. commissions to agents decreased 22.2 percent, or 59 million, and included approximately 17 million related to twa. the decrease was due primarily to a decrease of 8.6 percent in combined passenger revenues and the continued benefit from commission structure changes implemented in 2000. aircraft rentals increased 79 million, or 52.3 percent, due primarily to the addition of twa aircraft. other operating expense increased 13.3 percent, or 114 million, due primarily to the addition of twa. special charges result from the september 11, 2001 terrorist events and include approximately 496 million related to aircraft impairments and groundings, 61 million in facility exit costs, 55 million in employee charges, and approximately 20 million in other charges see footnote 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to these charges . the company will continue to evaluate whether any additional provisions and or revisions to the charges recorded as of september 30, 2001 are required during the fourth quarter of 2001. u.s. government grant represents the reimbursement for direct and incremental costs resulting from the terrorist attacks, including impairment charges and lost revenues, recognized by the company in the third quarter of 2001 relating to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act see further discussion in footnote 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements . other income expense , historically a net expense, increased 31 million due primarily to a decrease in interest income from the company's lower investment balances during 2001. 14 17 results of

douglas dc 9 fleet by october 2001. 16 19 results of operations continued for the nine months ended september 30, 2001 and 2000 summary amr's net loss for the nine months ended september 30, 2001 was 964 million, or 6.26 loss per share. this compares with income from continuing operations before extraordinary loss of 732 million, or 4.55 per share diluted, for the same period in 2000. amr's operating loss for the nine months ended september 30, 2001 was 1.3 billion, compared to operating income of 1.3 billion for the same period in 2000. on september 11, 2001, two of american's aircraft were hijacked and destroyed in terrorist attacks on the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon in northern virginia. on the same day, two united air lines aircraft were also hijacked and used in terrorist attacks. in response to the terrorist attacks, the faa issued a federal ground stop order on september 11, 2001, prohibiting all flights to, from, and within the united states.

result, the company announced that it would reduce its operating schedule to approximately 80 percent of the schedule it flew prior to september 11, 2001. on april 9, 2001, the company purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of twa. accordingly, the operating results of twa since the date of acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the nine month period ended september 30, 2001. amr's third quarter 2000 results from continuing operations include the effect of a labor disruption at one of the company's major competitors which positively impacted the company's net earnings by an estimated 0.22 to 0.28 per share diluted. the company's revenues increased approximately 315 million, or 2.1 percent, during the first nine months of 2001 versus the same period last year. however, excluding twa's revenues for the period april 10, 2001 through september 30, 2001, the company's revenues would have decreased approximately 1.1 billion versus the same period last year. the company's 2001 revenues, yield, revenue passenger miles and available seat miles were severely impacted by the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the reduced operating schedule, a worsening of the u.s. economy that had already been dampening the demand for travel both domestically and internationally prior to the september 11, 2001 events, business travel restrictions imposed by numerous companies as a result of the september 11, 2001 attacks, and increased fare sale activity occurring subsequent to the september 11 attacks to encourage passengers to resume flying. the company estimates the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to have negatively impacted the company's revenues by approximately 550 million to 650 million. american's passenger revenues decreased by 8.1 percent, or 1 billion. american's yield of 13.49 cents decreased by 2.7 percent compared to the same period in 2000. domestic yields decreased 3.9 percent from the first nine months of 2000. international yields increased 0.2 percent, reflecting an increase of 4.1 percent in latin american yields, mostly offset by a decrease of 7.0 percent and 2.6 percent in pacific and european yields, respectively. american's traffic or rpms decreased 5.5 percent to 84.1 billion miles for the nine months ended september 30, 2001. american's capacity or asms decreased 2.2 percent to 118.9 billion miles for the first nine months of 2001. american's domestic traffic decreased 6.8 percent on a capacity decrease of 2.4 percent while international traffic decreased 2.9 percent on capacity decreases of 1.6 percent. international activity included a 6.7 percent increase in traffic to the pacific on a capacity increase of 8.2 percent, a 4.0 percent decrease in traffic to europe on a capacity increase of 0.3 percent, and a 3.9 percent decrease in traffic to latin america on a capacity decrease of 5.2 percent. twa's passenger revenues were approximately 1.3 billion for the period april 10, 2001 through september 30, 2001. twa's traffic was 11.1 billion rpms while capacity was 16 billion asms. 17 20 results of operations continued the company's operating expenses increased 21.7 percent, or approximately 2.9 billion, and included approximately 1.5 billion related to twa's operations for the period april 10, 2001 through september 30, 2001. in addition to the specific explanations provided below, the significant decline in passenger traffic resulting from the terrorist acts of september 11, 2001 caused a favorable impact on certain passenger related operating expenses, including aircraft fuel, other rentals and landing fees, commissions to agents and food service. american's cost per asm increased 8.7 percent to 11.15 cents, excluding the impact of the second and third quarter 2001 special charges and u.s. government grant. the increase in american's cost per asm was driven partially by a reduction in asms due to the company's more room throughout coach program. adjusted for this program, american's cost per asm grew approximately 5 percent, excluding the impact of the special charges and u.s. government grant. wages, salaries and benefits increased 19.8 percent, or 993 million, and included approximately 600 million related to the addition of twa. the remaining increase of approximately 393 million related primarily to an increase in the average number of equivalent employees and contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the company's labor contracts. during the nine months ended september 30, 2001, the company recorded approximately 280 million in additional wages, salaries and benefits related to the company's new or tentative labor contracts. this was mostly offset by a 270 million decrease in the provision for profit sharing as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. aircraft fuel expense increased 31.5 percent, or 557 million, and included approximately 237 million related to the addition of twa. the increase in aircraft fuel expense was due to a 13.9 percent increase in the company's average price per gallon and a 12 percent increase in the company's fuel consumption, including twa. depreciation and amortization expense increased 16.2 percent, or 144 million, due primarily to the addition of new aircraft and an increase of approximately 55 million related to twa. maintenance, materials and repairs increased 89 million, or 10.8 percent, and included approximately 54 million related to twa. the remaining increase was due primarily to an increase in engine volumes at the company's maintenance bases. other rentals and landing fees increased 157 million, or 21.1 percent, and included approximately 97 million related to the addition of twa. the remaining increase of 60 million is due primarily to higher facilities rent and landing fees across american's system. commissions to agents decreased 13.2 percent, or 105 million, and included approximately 48 million related to twa. despite an increase of approximately 1.9 percent in combined passenger revenues, the company benefited from commission structure changes implemented in 2000. aircraft rentals increased 149 million, or 32.7 percent, due primarily to the addition of twa aircraft. other operating expense increased 17.1 percent, or 422 million, and included approximately 264 million related to twa. the remaining increase is due primarily to increases in outsourced services, data processing, twa integration expenses, and travel and incidental costs. special charges result from the september 11, 2001 terrorist events and the asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2001. the september 11, 2001 special charges include approximately 496 million related to aircraft impairments and groundings, 61 million in facility exit costs, 55 million in employee charges, and approximately 20 million in other charges. during the second quarter of 2001, the company recorded an asset impairment charge of 685 million relating to the writedown of the carrying value of the company's fokker 100, saab 340 and atr 42 aircraft and related rotables. the company will continue to evaluate whether any additional provisions and or revisions to the charges recorded as of september 30, 2001 are required during the fourth quarter of 2001 see further discussion in footnote 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements . u.s. government grant represents the reimbursement for direct and incremental costs resulting from the terrorist attacks, including impairment charges and lost revenues, recognized by the company in the third quarter of 2001 relating to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act see further discussion in footnote 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements . other income expense , historically a net expense, increased 67 million due primarily to a decrease of 28 million in interest income resulting from lower investment balances throughout most of the year and a decrease of 25 million in miscellaneous net. the latter reflects the 57 million gain in the second quarter of 2000 on the sale of the company's warrants to purchase 5.5 million shares of priceline common stock versus a 45 million gain during the second quarter of 2001 from the settlement of a legal matter related to the company's 1999 labor disruption, offset by the write down of certain investments held by the company during 2001. 18 21 results of operations continued operating statistics nine months

approximately 1.4 billion over the same period in 2000, due primarily to a decrease in income from continuing operations from the corresponding period in the prior year. capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2001 were 3.1 billion, and included the acquisition of 20 boeing 737 800s, 10 boeing 777 200ers, eight boeing 757 200s, eight embraer 140s, seven embraer 135s, six embraer 145 aircraft, and the purchase of 18 mcdonnell douglas md 80 aircraft previously leased by twa. these capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and debt agreements. four boeing 737 800 aircraft were financed through sale leaseback transactions. on april 9, 2001, the company purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of twa for approximately 742 million, which was funded from the company's existing cash and short term investments. the 742 million includes the 625 million purchase price paid to twa and various other acquisition costs, primarily the purchase of aircraft security deposits and prepaid rent. proceeds from the sale of equipment and property of 326 million included the proceeds received upon the delivery of four mcdonnell douglas md 11 aircraft to federal express. 19 22 as of september 30, 2001, the company had commitments to acquire the following aircraft 49 boeing 737 800s, 15 boeing 767 300ers, 15 boeing 757 200s, 10 boeing 777 200ers, 131 embraer regional jets and 25 bombardier crj 700s. future payments for all aircraft, including the estimated amounts for price escalation, will approximate 600 million during the remainder of 2001, 1.2 billion in 2002, 800 million in 2003 and an aggregate of approximately 3.3 billion in 2004 and beyond. these cash flows reflect a tentative agreement the company has with boeing to defer 29 of its 45 2002 deliveries to 2004 and beyond. as the company and boeing are still negotiating the final terms of the tentative agreement, the above aircraft commitment and cash flow amounts could change. the company has available a variety of future financing sources, including, but not limited to i the receipt of the remainder of the u.s. government grant, which approximates 452 million, ii additional secured aircraft debt agreements, including the issuance of approximately 1.3 billion of enhanced equipment trust certificates, with 740 million received at closing and the remainder to be received as aircraft are delivered, iii sale leaseback transactions of owned property, including aircraft and real estate, iv securitization of future operating receipts, v unsecured borrowings, and vi federal loan guarantees as provided under the act and other types of secured debt agreements. no assurance can be given that any of these financing sources will be available on terms acceptable to the company. as of september 30, 2001, the company is in compliance with the two financial covenants contained in the company's credit facility agreements. however, it is likely that a significant loss in the fourth quarter of 2001 could cause the company to violate one or both covenants, unless they are modified. american is currently pursuing such modifications to the agreements so that the company will remain in compliance with the covenants. absent such modification, the 819 million currently outstanding under the credit facility agreements could become due and payable in late first quarter 2002. subsequent to the september 11, 2001 events, standard poor's downgraded the senior unsecured credit rating of american from bbb to bb and moody's downgraded the senior unsecured credit rating of american from baa3 to ba2. the long term corporate credit ratings of american remain on standard poor's creditwatch with negative implications and moody's has retained the credit ratings of american on review for possible downgrade. the impact of the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001 and their aftermath on the company and the sufficiency of its financial resources to absorb that impact will depend on a number of factors, including i the magnitude and duration of the adverse impact of the terrorist attacks on the economy in general, and the airline industry in particular ii the company's ability to reduce its operating costs and conserve its financial resources, taking into account the increased costs it will incur as a consequence of the attacks, including those referred to below iii the higher costs associated with new airline security directives and any other increased regulation of air carriers iv the significantly higher costs of aircraft insurance coverage for future claims caused by acts of war, terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and other similar perils, and the extent to which such insurance will continue to be available v the company's ability to raise additional financing vi the price and availability of jet fuel, and the availability to the company of fuel hedges in light of current industry conditions vii the number of crew members who may be called for duty in the reserve forces of the armed services and the resulting impact on the company's ability to operate as planned viii any resulting declines in the values of the aircraft in the company's fleet and any aircraft or other asset impairment charge, including routes, slots, gates and other intangibles ix the extent of the benefits received by the company under the act, taking into account any challenges to and interpretations or amendments of the act or regulations issued pursuant thereto and x the company's ability to retain its management and other employees in light of current industry conditions and their impact on compensation and morale. at this point, due in part to the lack of predictability of future traffic, business mix and yields, the company is unable to fully estimate the impact on it of the events of september 11, 2001 and their consequences and the sufficiency of its financial resources to absorb that impact, including the mitigating effects of the act and the company's aggressive actions to reduce its costs. however, given the magnitude of these unprecedented events and the possible subsequent effects, the company expects that the adverse impact to the company's financial condition, its operations and its prospects will be material and could be highly material. 20 23 fourth quarter outlook capacity for american and twa combined will be down about 20 percent from last year's levels. eagle capacity will be down about 5 percent. traffic for the fourth quarter is challenging to predict, if not impossible. as of october 22, 2001, advanced booking levels are down six points in november and down four points in december, compared to the same date and for the same periods last year. these numbers could increase however, as current trends show a higher than normal number of booked passengers not showing up for their flights. yields may decline more steeply in the fourth quarter than in the third, owing to more and deeper fare sales and a weaker mix of business traffic. amr unit costs are expected to come in about two percent higher than last year at 11.8 cents despite a 20 percent cut in capacity. this is due in large part to the numerous cost reduction initiatives the company put in place in response to the september 11 terrorist attacks cutting capacity and grounding aircraft, sharply reducing capital spending, closing facilities, trimming food service and reducing its workforce. in addition, the company expects to see lower fuel prices. somewhat offsetting these cost savings will be higher security costs, higher insurance premiums and greater interest expense. notwithstanding the cost savings initiatives, the company is not able in the short term to reduce its costs commensurate with its capacity and revenue . as a result, the company expects to incur a significant loss in the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year 2001. special risk factor negative impact of terrorist attacks among the effects experienced by the company from the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks have been significant flight disruption costs caused by the faa's imposed grounding of the u.s. airline industry's fleet, significantly increased security and other costs, significantly higher ticket refunds, significantly reduced load factors, and significantly reduced yields. further terrorist attacks using commercial aircraft in flight could result in another grounding of the company's fleet, and would likely result in significant reductions in load factor and yields, along with increased ticket refund, security and other costs. in addition, terrorist attacks not involving commercial aircraft, or the general increase in hostilities relating to reprisals against terrorist organizations or otherwise, could result in decreased load factors and yields for airlines, including the company, and could also result in increased costs. new accounting pronouncements in july 2001, the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no. 141, business combinations sfas 141 and no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142 . sfas 141 prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method for business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001 and includes criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. sfas 142 includes the requirement to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them. the company will adopt sfas 142 in the first quarter of 2002, and currently estimates discontinuing the amortization of approximately 62 million on an annualized basis. the company is currently evaluating what additional
