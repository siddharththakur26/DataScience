REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Executive Committee and Members 
 HOVENSA L.L.C.

     
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of
HOVENSA L.L.C. (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, and the related statements of income and
cumulative earnings, cash flows and comprehensive income (loss)
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

     
We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     
In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of HOVENSA L.L.C. at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States.

Note 1:     Basis
of Financial Statements and Significant Accounting
Policies
     
Nature of
Business: HOVENSA L.L.C. (Company)
was formed as a joint venture between Petroleos de Venezuela,
SA. (PDVSA) and Amerada Hess Corporation (AHC) to own
and operate the Company’s refinery. The Company purchases
crude oil from PDVSA, AHC and third parties. It manufactures and
sells petroleum products primarily to PDVSA and AHC. In
preparing financial statements, management makes estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses in
the statement of income. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Estimates made by management include: inventory and
other asset valuations, environmental obligations, depreciable
lives and turnaround accruals.

     
The Company is jointly owned by
PDVSA V.I., Inc. (PDVSA V.I.), a subsidiary of
PDVSA, and Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), a subsidiary
of AHC.

     
A summary of all material transactions between
the Company, its members and affiliates follows:

The Company has a product sales agreement with
AHC and Petroleum Marketing International (Petromar), a
subsidiary of PDVSA. After any sales of refined products by
HOVENSA to third parties, Petromar and AHC each must purchase
50% of HOVENSA’s gasoline, distillate, residual fuel and
other products at market prices. The Company also has long-term
crude oil supply agreements with Petromar, by which Petromar
agrees to sell to HOVENSA a monthly average of
155,000 barrels per day of Mesa crude oil and
115,000 barrels per day of Merey crude oil.

PDVSA and AHC each guarantee the payment of up to
50% of the value of the crude oil purchases from third parties.
In addition, PDVSA and AHC have agreed to provide funding (50%
each) to the extent that the Company does not have funds to meet
its senior debt obligations up to $40,000 each, until completion
of construction required to meet final low sulfur fuel
regulations, after which the amount becomes $15,000 each.

     
Cash and Cash
Equivalents: Cash equivalents
consist of highly liquid investments, which are readily
convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or
less when acquired.

     
Debt Service Reserve
Fund: Cash held by a trustee that
is not available for general corporate purposes.

     
Inventories:
Inventories of crude oil and refined products are valued at the
lower of last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost or market. During
2003, a reduction of inventory quantities in a LIFO pool
resulted in a liquidation of LIFO inventories carried at below
market costs, which increased net income by approximately
$9,000. At December 31, 2003, LIFO inventory cost was
$185,192 lower than it would have been using the average cost
method.

     
Inventories of materials and supplies are valued
at the lower of average cost or market.

     
Revenue
Recognition: The Company
recognizes revenues from the sale of petroleum products when
title passes to the customer.

     
Depreciation:
Depreciation of refinery facilities is determined principally on
the units-of-production method based on estimated production
volumes. Depreciation of all other equipment is determined on
the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives.

Maintenance and
Repairs: The estimated cost of
major maintenance (turnarounds) is accrued. Other expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged against income as
incurred. Renewals and improvements are treated as additions to
property, plant and equipment, and items replaced are treated as
retirements.

     
Environmental
Policy: The Company capitalizes
environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency
of property or that reduce or prevent environmental
contamination. The Company accrues environmental expenses
resulting from existing conditions that relate to past
operations when the future costs are probable and reasonably
estimable.

     
Income Taxes:
The Company is a limited liability company and, as a result,
income taxes are the responsibility of the members.

     
Interest
Hedges: In 2001, under the terms
of its bank credit agreement, the Company was required to use
interest rate collars to reduce the effects of fluctuations in
interest expense related to long-term debt. These derivatives
were designated as hedges of future cash flow (cash flow hedges)
and the gains or losses were recorded in other comprehensive
income until the related transactions were expensed in 2002. The
company’s obligation to maintain these hedges was completed
in 2002.

HOVENSA’s pension asset allocation is

assumed long-term rate of return is consistent with the
long-term rate of return on plan assets of the member’s
plan with a similar asset allocation. The member’s
long-term rate of return is based on historical long-term
returns, adjusted downward slightly to reflect lower prevailing
interest rates.

The target investment allocations for the plan
assets are 55% equity securities and 45% debt securities. Asset
allocations are rebalanced on a regular basis throughout the
year to bring assets to within 2-3% range of target levels.
Target allocations take into account analyses performed by the
Company’s pension consultant to optimize long term
risk/return relationships. All assets are highly liquid and may
be readily adjusted to provide liquidity for current benefit
payment requirements.

     
The Company expects to contribute approximately $
7 million to its pension plan in 2004.


Note 6:     Interest
Hedges
     
On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted FAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. This statement required that the Company recognize
all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value and
established criteria for using derivatives as hedges.

     
The Company used interest rate collars to reduce
the effects of fluctuations in interest expense related to
long-term debt.

     
The January 1, 2001 transition adjustment
from adopting FAS No. 133 resulted from these hedges and
was a cumulative decrease in accumulated other comprehensive
income of $ 2,910. The adoption of FAS No. 133 did not
affect net income or cumulative earnings.

     
The interest rate collars and the hedged
transactions matured in 2002. These interest rate collars were
designated as hedges of expected future cash flows (cash flow
hedges), and the losses were recorded in other comprehensive
income until the hedged interest was recognized. At
December 31, 2001, deferred losses from interest hedging
were $ 6,955.

     
The Company reclassified hedging gains and losses
on interest rate collars from accumulated other comprehensive
income to interest expense (portions of which were capitalized)
over the period hedged. Hedging increased interest expense in
2001 by $ 3,415 (including $ 1,360 associated with the
transition adjustment at the beginning of the year) and $ 6,955
in 2002. The ineffective portion of hedges is included in
current earnings. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was not
material.

Note
7:     Environmental
Requirements
     
In December 1999, the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) adopted rules that phase in
limitations on the sulfur content of gasoline beginning in 2004.
In December 2000, the EPA adopted regulations to reduce
substantially the allowable sulfur content of diesel fuel by
2006. The EPA is also considering restriction or a prohibition
on the use of MTBE (New York and Connecticut have banned it
effective January 1, 2004), a gasoline additive that the
Company produces and uses to meet United States regulations
requiring oxygenation of reformulated gasoline.

     
The Company is reviewing options to determine the
most cost effective compliance strategies for these new fuel
regulations. The costs to comply will depend on a variety of
factors, including the availability of suitable technology and
contractors and whether the minimum oxygen content requirement
for reformulated gasoline remains in place if MTBE is banned.
Capital expenditures necessary to comply with the low sulfur
gasoline and diesel fuel requirements are estimated to be $
446,000 (including approximately $ 8,850 already incurred) and
are expected to be completed by 2006.


Note
8:     Contingencies
     
The Company is party to litigation arising out of
the normal course of its business. In the opinion of management,
all matters are adequately covered by insurance or reserves or,
if not covered or reserved for, are not likely to have a
material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company.
