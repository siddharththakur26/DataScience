PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.) 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 





 
 
 




Note 1 -

 
The financial statements included in this report reflect all normal and recurring
adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation
of the Corporation’s consolidated financial position at September 30, 2005 and December
31, 2004, the consolidated results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 and the consolidated cash flows for the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004. The unaudited results of operations for the
interim periods reported are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for
the full year.


 
 
 


 

 
Certain notes and other information have been condensed or omitted from these interim
financial statements. These statements, therefore, should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Corporation’s
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.


 
 
 


 

 
In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which clarifies the term “conditional asset
retirement obligation”, as used in FASB Statement 143. FIN 47 requires recognition of
a liability for legally required asset retirement obligations, when the timing or
method of settlement is conditional on a future event, if the liability can be
reasonably estimated. FIN 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15,
2005. The Corporation is assessing the effect of FIN 47, but does not expect it to
have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.


 
 
 


 

 
In September 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on EITF Issue No.
04-13 (EITF 04-13), Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory With the Same
Counterparty. EITF 04-13 prescribes the income statement presentation of inventory
purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty that are entered into in
contemplation of one another. EITF 04-13 is effective for interim reporting periods
beginning after March 15, 2006. The Corporation is assessing the effect of EITF 04-13,
but does not expect it to have a material effect on its results of operations or
classification of revenues or expenses.

During the first quarter of 2005, the Corporation permanently reduced LIFO inventories,
which were carried at a lower cost than the inventory cost at the time of the decrement.
The effect of the LIFO inventory liquidation, before income taxes, was to decrease cost
of products sold by approximately $11 million.

Note 4 -

 
FASB Staff Position No. FAS 19-1, Accounting for Suspended Well Costs, was issued in
April 2005 and is effective in the third quarter. This FASB Staff Position (FSP) addresses
circumstances that permit the continued capitalization of exploratory well costs beyond one
year. The FSP did not have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial position or results of operations.


 
 
 


 

 
The following table discloses the amount of capitalized exploratory well costs pending
determination of proved reserves at September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004 and the
changes therein (dollars in millions):

The preceding table excludes exploratory dry hole costs of $103 million in the first
nine months of 2005 and $75 million in the year 2004 relating to wells that were drilled
and expensed within the same period. Capitalized well costs of $58 million were
expensed in the first nine months of 2005, principally relating to deepwater Gulf of
Mexico wells in the process of drilling at December 31, 2004. The period end
capitalized costs reflected above relate to wells in process of drilling and capitalized
successful wells primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. At September 30,
2005, $116 million of capitalized costs are associated with wells
that are one to three years old. These wells related to three
projects which are progressing towards development.


 
 
 


Note 5 -

 
During the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005, the Corporation capitalized interest of $22

Note 10 -

 
The Corporation records compensation expense for restricted common stock ratably over the
vesting period, which is generally three to five years. The Corporation uses the intrinsic
value method to account for employee stock options. Because the exercise prices of employee
stock options equal or exceed the market price of the stock on the date of grant, the
Corporation does not recognize compensation expense.


 
 
 


 

 
The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of employee stock
options for pro forma disclosure. Using the fair value method, stock option expense would be
recognized over the one- to three-year vesting periods. The following pro forma financial
information presents the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the Corporation
used the fair value method (in millions, except per share data):

Includes restricted common stock and stock option expense determined using the fair value method.






 
 
 




 

 
In 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 123R, Share-Based
Payment (FAS 123R). This standard requires that compensation expense for all stock-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the
income statement based on fair values. The Corporation must adopt FAS 123R
no later than January 1, 2006. The Corporation is evaluating the requirements of FAS
123R and believes that if it adopted the standard in the periods shown above, the impact
would not have differed materially from the additional compensation expense disclosed in
the above table.

At September 30, 2005, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included after-tax
deferred losses of $1,713 million ($45 million of
realized losses and $1,668 million of unrealized losses) related to crude oil
contracts used as hedges of future exploration and production sales. Realized losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income represent losses on closed contracts that are
deferred until the underlying barrels are sold. After-tax realized losses will reduce
fourth quarter 2005 income by $45 million. The pre-tax amount of deferred hedge losses
is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as
deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.


 
 
 


 

 
In its energy marketing business, the Corporation has entered into cash flow hedges to
fix the purchase prices of natural gas, heating oil, residual fuel oil and electricity
related to contracted future sales. At September 30, 2005, the net after-tax deferred
gain in accumulated other comprehensive income from these hedge contracts was $31
million.

PART I- FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

Overview

     The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two
segments, exploration and production (E&P) and refining and marketing (R&M). The E&P
segment explores for, produces and sells crude oil and natural gas. The R&M segment
manufactures, purchases, trades and markets refined petroleum products and other energy
products. Net income was $790 million for the first nine months of 2005, including $760
million from E&P activities and $286 million from R&M operations.

     Exploration and Production: Worldwide oil and gas production averaged 312,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day during the third quarter of 2005, a decrease of 3%
from the third quarter of 2004. Hurricane-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and
temporary interruptions at several non-operated fields in the North Sea resulted in this
decline. It is anticipated that 85% of Gulf of Mexico production impacted by hurricane
activity will be restored in November and over 90% will be restored in December. As a
result of the hurricanes and temporary interruptions at production facilities, fourth
quarter production is estimated to be in the range of 320,000 to 330,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day.

     The Corporation recently announced an agreement with another oil company to acquire
its 55% working interest in the deepwater section of the West Mediterranean Block 1
Concession in Egypt for $413 million. In a separate transaction, the same company will
acquire the Corporation’s interests in eight fields located in the Permian Basin in West
Texas and New Mexico for $404 million. The West Mediterranean transaction is subject to
Egyptian Government and other regulatory approvals and the Permian Basin transaction is
subject to the exercise of preferential rights. Completion of these transactions is
expected in the first quarter of 2006.

     In early 2005, the Corporation announced the acquisition of a controlling interest
in Samara-Nafta, a company operating in the Volga-Urals region of Russia. Through the
end of October 2005, Samara-Nafta has acquired five additional licenses, increasing our
total investment to approximately $230 million. Production from our Russian subsidiary
averaged 8,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.

     Refining and Marketing: The HOVENSA refinery benefited from a strong margin
environment, but operated at somewhat reduced throughput as a result of a scheduled
turnaround of a crude unit. Marketing results were negatively impacted by lower
margins, reflecting the higher cost of post-hurricane product supply.

Results of Operations

     Net income for the third quarter of 2005 amounted to $272 million compared with $178 million in the third quarter of 2004. Net income for
the first nine months of 2005 was $790 million compared with $748 million in the first nine months of 2004. See the table below for a
summary of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods. The after-tax results by major operating activity for the
three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows (in millions, except per share data):

     In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are
disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax
basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings.
Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining
variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than
only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate
income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.

     The following items, on an after-tax basis, are included in net income for the
three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 (in millions):

PART I- FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)

Results of Operations (Continued)

     Earnings in the third quarter of 2005 include a charge of $14 million ($22 million
before income taxes) resulting from incremental hurricane related expenses.
Substantially all of the pre-tax costs were recorded in production expenses. The
Corporate tax charges of $31 million in the third quarter and $72 million in the first
nine months of 2005 represent income tax provisions relating to the repatriation of
foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

     Earnings in the first nine months of 2005 include income tax benefits of $11
million, reflecting the effect on deferred income taxes of a reduction in the income tax
rate in Denmark and a tax settlement in the United Kingdom. Year-to-date results also
include a net gain of $11 million ($18 million before income taxes) on the disposition
of a mature North Sea asset. In addition, a net gain of $11 million ($19 million before
income taxes) was recorded on a legal settlement reflecting the favorable resolution of
contingencies on a prior year asset sale. Results for the first nine months of 2005
also include a charge of $7 million ($10 million before income taxes) for premiums on
bond repurchases.

PART I- FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)

Results of Operations (Continued)

     After considering the items affecting exploration and production results described
above, the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily
attributable to changes in selling prices, sales volumes and operating costs and
exploration expenses, as discussed below.

     Selling prices: Higher average selling prices of crude oil and natural gas
increased exploration and production revenues by $253 million in the third quarter and
$605 million in the first nine months of 2005 compared with the corresponding periods of
2004. The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows:

     Crude oil hedges reduced exploration and production earnings by $294 million and
$720 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 ($479 million and $1,150
million before income taxes). Hedging decreased exploration and production results by
$184 million ($294 million before income taxes) in the third quarter of 2004 and $383
million ($613 million before income taxes) in the first nine months of 2004.

PART I- FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)

Results of Operations (Continued)

     The Corporation has after-tax, deferred hedge losses of $1,713 million recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at September 30, 2005 related to crude oil
hedges. Of this amount, $1,668 million is unrealized and relates to open hedge
positions and the remaining $45 million is realized. The realized loss of $45 million
will reduce earnings during the fourth quarter of 2005 as the related barrels are sold.
See Market Risk Disclosure for a summary of the Corporation’s open hedge positions.

     Sales and production volumes: The Corporation’s oil and gas production, on a
barrel of oil equivalent basis was 312,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2005
compared with 323,000 barrels per day in the same period of 2004. Production in the
first nine months of 2005 was 341,000 barrels per day compared with 340,000 barrels per
day in the first nine months of 2004. The Corporation anticipates that its average
production for the fourth quarter of 2005 will be approximately 320,000 to 330,000
barrels per day. The Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows (in

Reflects natural gas production converted based on relative energy content (six Mcf equals one barrel).


     United States crude oil and natural gas production in the third quarter of 2005 was
lower than in the corresponding period of 2004 due to interruptions from hurricane
activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Crude oil and natural gas production in Europe was
lower in the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 compared with 2004, primarily
reflecting natural decline and maintenance. These decreases were partially offset by
new production in 2005 from Block A-18 in the joint development area of Malaysia and
Thailand, Samara-Nafta, our Russian subsidiary and the Central Azeri Field in
Azerbaijan. In addition, during 2005 there was increased crude oil production from the
Llano Field in the Gulf of Mexico and Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea. Crude oil and

natural gas sales volumes were comparable in the third quarter of 2005 and 2004. Higher
sales volumes increased revenues by $19 million in the first nine months of 2005
compared with 2004.

     Operating costs and exploration expenses: Production expenses were higher in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2005 compared with 2004 principally reflecting
higher maintenance expenses and increased production taxes. Exploration expenses
increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2005, reflecting increased
drilling and seismic activity compared with 2004. Depreciation, depletion and
amortization charges were also higher in 2005 principally due to higher depreciation
rates. General and administrative expenses were comparable in the third quarters of
2005 and 2004, but lower in the first nine months of 2005, due to charges for vacated
office space in London during 2004.

     Other: After-tax foreign currency gains relating to exploration and production
activities amounted to $2 million in the third quarter and $17 million in the first nine
months of 2005 compared with gains of $4 million and $12 million in the corresponding
periods of 2004. The pre-tax amounts were gains of $5 million and losses of $.3 million
in the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 compared with a gain of $9 million in
the third quarter and $11 million in the first nine months of 2004. Pre-tax amounts are
recorded in non-operating income (expense).

     The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in the
first nine months of 2005 was 43% compared with 46% in the first nine months of 2004.

     The Corporation’s future exploration and production earnings may be impacted by
volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production
changes, industry cost inflation, exploration expenses and changes in tax rates.

Refining and Marketing

     Earnings from refining and marketing activities amounted to $125 million in the
third quarter of 2005 compared with $85 million in the corresponding period of 2004. For
the first nine months of 2005, refining and marketing operations earned $286 million
compared with $358 million in 2004. The Corporation’s downstream operations include
HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) accounted for on the equity method. Additional
refining and marketing activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy marketing and trading
operations.

     Refining: Refining earnings, which consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s
results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on the note receivable from PDVSA and
other miscellaneous items, were $144 million in the third quarter and $263 million in
the first nine months of 2005 compared with $68 million in the third quarter and $265
million in the first nine months of 2004.

     The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income before income taxes was $151 million
($93 million after income taxes) in the third quarter of 2005 compared with income of
$75 million ($58 million after income taxes) in the third quarter of 2004. For the first
nine months of 2005, the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income was $309 million ($190
million after income taxes) compared with $223 million ($189 million after income taxes)
in the first nine months of 2004. The increased earnings in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2005 were due to higher refined product margins. In 2005, the
Corporation provided income taxes at the Virgin Islands statutory rate of 38.5% on
HOVENSA’s income and the interest income on the PDVSA note. In the first nine months of
2004, income taxes on HOVENSA’s earnings were partially offset by available loss
carryforwards. A crude unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for 30 days of planned maintenance
in the third quarter of 2005 and the fluid catalytic cracking unit was shutdown for 30
days of maintenance in the first quarter.

     Pre-tax interest on the PDVSA note amounted to $5 million in the third quarter and
$15 million in the first nine months of 2005 compared with $6 million and $19 million in
the corresponding periods of 2004.

     Port Reading earnings were $48 million in the third quarter and $62 million in the
first nine months of 2005 compared with $4 million and $49 million in the corresponding
periods of 2004, reflecting higher margins. The Port Reading facility was shutdown for
36 days of planned maintenance in the first quarter of 2005. In the third quarter of
2004, the Port Reading facility had a storm-related shutdown for 25 days.

     Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail
gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated a loss of $22 million in the third
quarter of 2005 and income of $5 million in the first nine months of 2005 compared with
income of $6 million and $49 million in the same periods of 2004. The decreases
reflected lower margins, primarily due to the higher cost of post-hurricane product
supply. Marketing expenses were higher in the third quarter and first nine months of
2005 compared with 2004 primarily reflecting additional retail sites. Total refined
product sales volumes were 435,000 barrels per day in the first nine months of 2005 and
427,000 barrels per day in the first nine months of 2004.

     The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades
energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions
for its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities,
including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership, amounted to income of $3
million ($6 million before income taxes) in the third quarter and $18 million ($34
million before income taxes) in the first nine months of 2005. Trading activities
resulted in income of $11 million ($18 million before income taxes) in the third quarter
and $44 million ($75 million before income taxes) in the first nine months of 2004.

     Refining and marketing earnings will likely continue to be volatile reflecting
competitive industry conditions and supply and demand factors, including the effects of
weather.

Corporate

     After-tax corporate expenses amounted to $54 million in the third quarter and $151
million in the first nine months of 2005 compared with $23 million and $49 million in
the same periods of 2004. The third quarter and first nine months of 2005 include income
tax provisions of $31 million and $72 million, respectively, for the repatriation of
foreign earnings to the United States under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net
Corporate expenses in the first nine months of 2005 also include net expenses of $7
million ($10 million before income taxes) for premiums on bond repurchases. The results
for the first nine months of 2004 include a non-cash income tax benefit of $13 million
resulting from the completion of a prior year United States income tax audit. Excluding
these items, corporate expenses were comparable in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004
and higher in the first nine months of 2005 reflecting severance and other benefit
costs.

Sales and Other Operating Revenues

     Sales and other operating revenues increased by 51% in the third quarter and 29% in
the first nine months of 2005 compared with the corresponding periods of 2004. This
increase reflects higher selling prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products.
The increase in cost of goods sold also reflects the increased costs of refined products
purchased.

Discontinued Operations

     Income from discontinued operations of $7 million in the first nine months of 2004
reflects the settlement of a previously accrued contingency relating to a foreign
exploration and production operation that was disposed of in 2003.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Overview: Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2005 totaled $759 million, a
decrease of $118 million from year-end. The Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio
was 40.7% the same as at December 31, 2004. Total debt was $3,787 million at September
30, 2005 and $3,835 million at December 31, 2004. The Corporation has debt maturities
of $1 million during the remainder of 2005 and $78 million in 2006.

     Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities
including changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $1,551 million in the
first nine months of 2005 compared with $1,649 million in the same period of 2004. In
the first nine months of 2004, changes in operating assets and liabilities increased net
cash provided by $377 million. In the first nine months of 2005, the Corporation
received cash distributions of $275 million from HOVENSA, compared with $88 million in
the first nine months of 2004.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)

     Cash Flows from Financing Activities: The Corporation reduced debt by $48 million
during the first nine months of 2005 and $106 million in the first nine months of 2004.
Dividends paid were $147 million and $145 million in the first nine months of 2005 and
2004, respectively. The Corporation received proceeds from the exercise of stock
options of $61 million in the first nine months of 2005 and $85 million in the
corresponding period of 2004.

     Future Capital Requirements and Resources: Capital and exploratory expenditures
for 2005 are currently estimated to be approximately $2.4 to $2.6 billion. The
Corporation anticipates that available cash and cash flow from operations will fund
these expenditures; however, revolving credit facilities are available, if necessary.

     With higher crude oil prices, the Corporation’s collateral requirements under
certain contracts with hedging and trading counterparties have increased. Outstanding
letters of credit were $3,048 million at September 30, 2005, including $344 million
drawn against the Corporation’s revolving credit facility, $1,625 million under
committed short-term letter of credit facilities entered into in the first nine months
of 2005, and the remainder under uncommitted lines. Outstanding letters of credit were
$1,487 million at December 31, 2004. At September 30, 2005, the Corporation has $2,052
million available under its $2.5 billion syndicated revolving credit agreement and has
additional unused lines of credit of $289 million, primarily for letters of credit,
under uncommitted arrangements with banks. The Corporation also has a shelf
registration under which it may issue $825 million of additional debt securities,
warrants, common stock or preferred stock.

     Loan agreement covenants allow the Corporation to borrow an additional $5.4 billion
for the construction or acquisition of assets at September 30, 2005. The maximum amount
of dividends that can be paid from borrowings under the loan agreements is $2 billion at
September 30, 2005.

     In October 2005, the Corporation announced that it had reached an agreement to
acquire a 55% working interest in the deepwater section of a concession with natural gas
discoveries offshore Egypt for approximately $413 million. A 25 year development lease
for the deepwater section of the block has been signed and a gas sales agreement is in
place for sales to the Egyptian market. Commencement of production is planned for 2009.
The Corporation also announced the sale to the same company of certain producing
properties located in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico for approximately
$404 million. The transactions are subject to government and other regulatory approvals
and are expected to close in the first quarter of 2006.

     Libya: Prior to June 30, 1986, the Corporation had extensive exploration and
production operations in Libya; however, U.S. Government sanctions required suspension
of participation in these operations. The Corporation wrote off the book value of its
Libyan assets in connection with the cessation of operations. During 2004, the
Corporation received U.S. Government authorization to negotiate and execute an agreement
with the government of Libya that would define the terms for resuming active
participation in the Libyan properties. The U.S. Government has lifted most of the
sanctions imposed on Libya and has rescinded the Libya portions of the Iran-Libya
Sanction Act of 1976. As a result, the Corporation and its partners will be able to
resume

21

operations in Libya if they are able to reach a successful conclusion to commercial
negotiations. If these negotiations are successful, management anticipates capital
expenditures will increase over the current plan.

     Repatriation Provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004: The American
Jobs Creation Act (the Act) provides for a one-time reduction in the income tax rate to
5.25% on eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a U.S. parent. During 2005,
the Corporation’s Board of Directors approved plans to repatriate $1.9 billion of
unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, the Corporation recorded a tax provision of
$72 million, including $31 million in the third quarter. The Corporation’s Board of
Directors has now approved repatriation plans at the maximum level permitted under the
Act.

     Credit Ratings: Two credit rating agencies have rated the Corporation’s debt as
investment grade; one agency’s rating is below investment grade. If another rating
agency were to reduce its credit rating below investment grade, the Corporation would
have to comply with a more stringent financial covenant contained in its revolving
credit facility. In addition, margin requirements with hedging and trading
counterparties at September 30, 2005 would increase by approximately $15 million.

     Other: In connection with the sale of six vessels in 2002, the Corporation agreed
to support the buyer’s charter rate on these vessels for up to five years. The support
agreement requires that if the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is
less than the stipulated support rate in the agreement, the Corporation will pay to the
buyer the difference between the contracted rate and the stipulated rate. The balance in
the charter support reserve at January 1 was approximately $10 million and at September
30 was $9 million.

     At January 1, 2005, the Corporation had an accrual of $39 million for vacated
office costs in London. During the first nine months of 2005, $5 million of payments
were made reducing the accrual to $34 million at September 30, 2005. Additional
accruals totaling approximately $25 to $30 million, before income taxes, are anticipated
in the first half of 2006 for office space to be vacated.

     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Corporation has leveraged leases not included
in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation
operates. The net present value of these leases is $480 million at September 30, 2005.
The Corporation’s September 30, 2005 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from
40.7% to 43.6% if the leases were included as debt.

     The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSA’s crude oil
purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA. At September 30, 2005, the guarantee
amounted to $173 million. This amount fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil
purchased and related crude oil prices. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to
provide funding up to a maximum of $40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds
to meet its senior debt obligations. The Corporation also has a loan guarantee of $57
million relating to a foreign crude oil pipeline in which it has a 2.36% interest.

PART I- FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)

Market Risk Disclosure

     In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks
related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and
electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In
the disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as non-trading activities.
The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest
in a trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks
primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products.

     Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign
exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity linked
securities in its non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are widely traded
instruments mainly with standardized terms. In some cases, physical purchase and sale
contracts are used as trading instruments and are included in the trading results.

     Quantitative Measures: The Corporation uses value-at-risk to monitor and control
commodity risk within its trading activities. The value-at-risk model uses historical
simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a
95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for
options. The potential change in fair value based on commodity price risk is presented
in the non-trading and trading sections below.

     Non-Trading: The Corporation’s exploration and production segment uses futures and
swaps to fix the selling prices of a portion of its future production and the related
gains or losses are an integral part of its selling prices. As of September 30, the
Corporation has not hedged any of its future natural gas production. Following is a
summary of the crude oil hedges as of September 30, 2005:

     Because the selling price of crude oil has increased significantly since the hedges
were acquired, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at September 30, 2005
includes after-tax deferred losses of $1,713 million related to crude oil contracts used
as hedges of future exploration and production sales. As market conditions change, the
Corporation may adjust its hedge percentages.

     The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum
products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses futures and swaps to fix
the purchase prices of commodities to be sold under fixed-price sales contracts.

     The Corporation estimates that at September 30, 2005, the value-at-risk for
commodity related derivatives that are settled in cash and used in non-trading
activities was $104 million ($108 million at December 31, 2004). The results may vary
from time to time as hedge levels change.

     Trading: The trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest
trades energy commodities and derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are
consolidated with those of the Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading
positions for its own account. These strategies include proprietary position management
and trading to enhance the potential return on assets. The information that follows
represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporation’s proprietary trading
accounts.
