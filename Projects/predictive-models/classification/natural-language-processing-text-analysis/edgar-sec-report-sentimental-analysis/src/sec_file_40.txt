Business and Properties


     
Amerada Hess Corporation (the Registrant) is a Delaware
corporation, incorporated in 1920. The Registrant and its
subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the
“Corporation”) explore for, produce, purchase,
transport and sell crude oil and natural gas. These exploration
and production activities take place in the United States,
United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, Algeria,
Gabon, Indonesia, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Malaysia and other
countries. The Corporation also manufactures, purchases, trades
and markets refined petroleum and other energy products. The
Corporation owns 50% of a refinery joint venture in the United
States Virgin Islands, and another refining facility, terminals
and retail gasoline stations located on the East Coast of the
United States.


Exploration and Production

     
At December 31, 2004, the Corporation had 646 million
barrels of proved crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves,
the same as at the end of 2003. Proved natural gas reserves were
2,400 million Mcf at December 31, 2004 compared with
2,332 million Mcf at December 31, 2003. Proved
reserves at December 31, 2004 include 37% and 52%,
respectively, of crude oil and natural gas reserves held under
production sharing contracts. Of the total proved reserves (on a
barrel of oil equivalent basis), 17% are located in the United
States, 39% are located in the United Kingdom, Norwegian and
Danish sectors of the North Sea, 17% are located in Africa and
the remainder are located in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and
Azerbaijan. On a barrel of oil equivalent basis, 38% of the
Corporation’s December 31, 2004 worldwide proved
reserves are undeveloped (32% in 2003). Most of the proved
undeveloped reserves relate to properties being developed in
Africa and Asia.

     
Worldwide crude oil and natural gas liquids production amounted
to 246,000 barrels per day in 2004 compared with
259,000 barrels per day in 2003. Worldwide natural gas
production was 575,000 Mcf per day in 2004 compared with
683,000 Mcf per day in 2003. On a barrel of oil equivalent
basis, production from continuing operations was
342,000 barrels per day in 2004 compared with
360,000 barrels per day in 2003. The Corporation presently
estimates that its 2005 barrel of oil equivalent production
will be approximately 350,000 barrels per day. The
Corporation is developing a number of oil and gas fields and has
an inventory of domestic and foreign exploration prospects.

venture with the Algerian national oil company that is
redeveloping three oil fields. The Corporation’s share of
production averaged 23,000 and 19,000 barrels of crude oil
per day in 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2004, the second
phase of the project to redevelop these fields was approved,
resulting in an increased investment commitment of approximately
$400 million.

the HOVENSA refining joint venture in the United States Virgin
Islands with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.
(PDVSA). In addition, it owns and operates a refining facility
in Port Reading, New Jersey.

     
HOVENSA. HOVENSA’s total crude runs amounted
to 484,000 barrels per day in 2004 and 440,000 barrels
per day in 2003. The fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA
operated at the rates of 139,000 and 142,000 barrels per
day in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The coking unit at HOVENSA
operated at the rate of 55,000 barrels per day in 2004 and
53,000 barrels per day in 2003. The coker permits HOVENSA
to run lower-cost heavy crude oil. HOVENSA has a long-term
supply contract with PDVSA to purchase 115,000 barrels
per day of Venezuelan Merey heavy crude oil. PDVSA also supplies
155,000 barrels

per day of Venezuelan Mesa medium gravity crude oil to HOVENSA
under a long-term crude oil supply contract. The remaining crude
oil requirements are purchased mainly under contracts of one
year or less from third parties and through spot purchases on
the open market. After sales of refined products by HOVENSA to
third parties, the Corporation purchases 50% of
HOVENSA’s remaining production at market prices.

     
Port Reading Facility. The Corporation owns and
operates a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port Reading,
New Jersey. This facility processes vacuum gas oil and residual
fuel oil and operated at a rate of approximately
52,000 barrels per day in 2004 and 54,000 barrels per
day in 2003. Substantially all of Port Reading’s production
is gasoline and heating oil.

     
Marketing. The Corporation markets refined
petroleum products on the East Coast of the United States to the
motoring public, wholesale distributors, industrial and
commercial users, other petroleum companies, governmental
agencies and public utilities. It also markets natural gas to
utilities and other industrial and commercial customers. The
Corporation’s energy marketing activities include the sale
of electricity. The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a
consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and
derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for
its own account.

     
The Corporation has 1,254 HESS® gasoline stations at
December 31, 2004, of which approximately 67% are company
operated. The Corporation has 941 convenience stores at its
gasoline stations. In early 2004, a 50% owned joint venture
acquired a chain of gasoline stations, adding approximately 50
HESS® retail outlets. Most of the Corporation’s
gasoline stations are in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Florida, Massachusetts and North and South Carolina. The
Corporation owns approximately 50% of the properties on which
the stations are located.

     
The Corporation has 22 terminals with an aggregate storage
capacity of 21 million barrels in its East Coast marketing
areas.

     
Refined product sales averaged 428,000 barrels per day in
2004 and 419,000 barrels per day in 2003. Of total refined
products sold in 2004, approximately 54% was obtained from
HOVENSA and Port Reading. The Corporation purchased the balance
from others under short-term supply contracts and by spot
purchases from various sources.

     
In June 2004, the Corporation formed a 50% owned joint venture,
Hess LNG, which will pursue investments in liquefied natural gas
(LNG) terminals and related supply, trading and marketing
opportunities. The joint venture is pursuing development of an
LNG terminal project located in Fall River, Massachusetts.

     
The Corporation has a wholly-owned subsidiary that provides
distributed electricity generating equipment to industrial and
commercial customers as an alternative to purchasing electricity
from local utilities. The Corporation also has invested in
long-term technology to develop fuel cells for electricity
generation through a venture with other parties.


Competition and Market Conditions

     
The petroleum industry is highly competitive. The Corporation
encounters competition from numerous companies in each of its
activities, particularly in acquiring rights to explore for
crude oil and natural gas and in the purchasing and marketing of
refined products and natural gas. Many competitors are larger
and have substantially greater resources than the Corporation.
The Corporation is also in competition with producers and
marketers of other forms of energy.

     
The petroleum business involves large-scale capital expenditures
and risk-taking. In the search for new oil and gas reserves,
long lead times are often required from successful exploration
to subsequent production. Operations in the petroleum industry
are dependent upon a depleting natural resource. The number of
areas where it can be expected that hydrocarbons will be
discovered in commercial quantities is constantly diminishing
and exploration risks are high. Areas where hydrocarbons may be
found are often in remote locations or offshore where
exploration and development activities are capital intensive and
operating costs are high.

The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), exert
considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil
and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to
agree on a common policy on rates of production and other
matters has a significant impact on oil markets and the
Corporation. The derivatives markets are also important in
influencing the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas and
refined products. The Corporation cannot predict the extent to
which future market conditions may be affected by foreign oil
producing countries, the derivatives markets or other external
influences.


Other Items

     
Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and
regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax
claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract
rights, and changes in import regulations, as well as other
political developments may affect the Corporation’s
operations. The Corporation has been affected by certain of
these events in various countries in which it operates. The
Corporation markets motor fuels through lessee-dealers and
wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits
producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in
retail marketing of motor fuels. Similar legislation has been
periodically proposed in the U.S. Congress and in various
other states. The Corporation, at this time, cannot predict the
effect of any of the foregoing on its future operations.

     
Compliance with various existing environmental and pollution
control regulations imposed by federal, state and local
governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Corporation’s earnings and competitive position within
the industry. The Corporation spent $12 million in 2004 for
environmental remediation, with a comparable amount anticipated
for 2005. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to
comply with federal, state and local environmental standards,
were $1 million in 2004 and the Corporation anticipates
approximately $35 million in 2005. Regulatory changes
already made or anticipated in the United States will alter the
composition and emissions characteristics of motor fuels. Future
capital expenditures necessary to comply with these regulations
will be substantial. The Environmental Protection Agency has
adopted rules that limit the amount of sulfur in gasoline and
diesel fuel. Capital expenditures necessary to comply with the
low-sulfur gasoline requirements at Port Reading are estimated
to be approximately $70 million over the next two years.
Capital expenditures to comply with low-sulfur gasoline and
diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are currently expected to be
approximately $400 million over the next two years,
$50 million of which has already been spent. HOVENSA
expects to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow
and, if necessary, future borrowings.

     
The number of persons employed by the Corporation averaged
11,119 in 2004 and 11,481 in 2003.

     
The Corporation’s Internet address is www.hess.com. On its
website, the Corporation makes available free of charge its
annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments
to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Corporation electronically
files with or furnishes such material to the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Copies of the Corporation’s Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics, its Corporate Governance Guidelines
and the charters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and
Management Development Committee and the Corporate Governance
and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors are available
on the Corporation’s website and are also available free of
charge upon request to the Secretary of the Corporation at its
principal executive offices. The Corporation has also filed with
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) its annual certification that
the Corporation’s chief executive officer is unaware of any
violation of the NYSE’s corporate governance standards.


Oil and Gas Reserves

     
The Corporation’s net proved oil and gas reserves at the
end of 2004, 2003 and 2002 are presented under Supplementary Oil
and Gas Data in the accompanying financial statements.

     
During 2004, the Corporation provided oil and gas reserve
estimates for 2003 to the Department of Energy. Such estimates
are compatible with the information furnished to the SEC on
Form 10-K, although

not necessarily directly comparable due to the requirements of
the individual requests. There were no differences in excess of
5%.

     
The Corporation has no contracts or agreements to sell fixed
quantities of its crude oil production, although derivative
instruments are used to reduce the effects of changes in selling
prices. In the United States, natural gas is sold to local
distribution companies, and commercial, industrial and other
purchasers, on a spot basis and under contracts for varying
periods. The Corporation’s United States production is
expected to approximate 55% of its 2005 sales commitments under
long-term contracts that total approximately 275,000 Mcf
per day. Natural gas sales commitments for 2006 are expected to
be comparable. The Corporation attempts to minimize price and
supply risks associated with its United States natural gas
supply commitments by entering into purchase contracts with
third parties having adequate sources of supply, on terms
substantially similar to those under its commitments.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings


     
Purported class actions consolidated under the complaint
captioned In re Amerada Hess Corporation Securities
Litigation are pending in the United States District Court
for the District of New Jersey, against certain executive
officers and former executive officers of the Registrant
alleging that these individuals sold shares of Registrant’s
common stock in advance of Registrant’s acquisition of
Triton Energy Limited (Triton) in 2001 in violation of federal
securities laws. In April 2003, the Registrant and the other
defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a
claim and failure to plead fraud with particularity. On
March 31, 2004, the court granted the defendants’
motion to dismiss the complaint. The plaintiffs were granted
leave to file an amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed an amended
complaint in June 2004. In August 2004, defendant moved to
dismiss the plaintiffs amended complaint. This motion is
currently pending with the District Court. Two other purported
class actions, based in large part on the same factual
background, were commenced in May and August 2003 and were
consolidated under a complaint captioned Falk et. al. v.
Amerada Hess Corporation, et. al. in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey against certain
named executive officers, certain directors and former directors
and certain employees of Registrant on behalf of participants in
the

10



Table of Contents

Registrant’s savings and stock bonus plans, alleging that
the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, resulting in losses to
participants in the plan who held shares of the
Registrant’s common stock. Registrant and the other
defendants moved to dismiss these actions in December 2003. This
motion was denied by the District Court in May 2004. Registrant
has reached a tentative settlement of these actions, subject to
approval of the District Court. The Registrant is advancing
expenses to these individuals in accordance with its By-Laws to
defend these actions. Based on current legal and factual
circumstances, Registrant does not believe these actions will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.

     
Registrant has been served with a complaint from the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) relating to
alleged violations at its petroleum terminal in Brooklyn, New
York. The complaint, which seeks an order to shut down the
terminal and penalties in unspecified amounts, alleges
violations involving the structural integrity of certain tanks,
the erosion of shorelines and bulkheads, petroleum discharges
and improper certification of tank repairs. DEC is also seeking
relief relating to remediation of certain gasoline stations in
the New York metropolitan area. Registrant believes that many of
the allegations are factually inaccurate or based on an
incorrect interpretation of applicable law. Registrant has
already addressed the primary conditions discussed in the
complaint. Registrant intends to vigorously contest the
complaint, but is involved in settlement discussions with DEC.

     
Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into
consent agreements to resolve EPA’s assertions that
refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying
with New Source Review regulations that require permits and new
emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations
that impose emissions control requirements. These consent
agreements, which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative
focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically
imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required
significant capital expenditures to install emissions control
equipment. EPA contacted Registrant and HOVENSA L.L.C.
(HOVENSA), its 50% owned joint venture with Petroleos de
Venezuela, regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in August
2003 and held an initial meeting in October 2003. While EPA has
not made any specific assertions that the Registrant or HOVENSA
violated the New Source Review regulations, the Registrant and
HOVENSA expect to have further discussions with EPA regarding
the petroleum refining initiative.

     
In June 2001, the Corporation voluntarily investigated and
disclosed to the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection (NJDEP) that there was a calculation error
in the program code of the Port Reading refining facility’s
Wet Gas Scrubber (WGS) Continuous Emissions Monitoring
System (CEM). The error in the code resulted in the CEM system
under calculating CO, NOx and SO2 emissions from the
WGS beginning in late 1998 and some exceedances of the permit
limits for NOx. After discovery, the code error was promptly
corrected. In November 2003, the Corporation received a notice
of violation from the NJDEP relating to the CEM coding error
that proposes a fine of $649,600, subsequently revised to
$319,600. The Corporation is engaging in settlement discussions
with NJDEP to resolve this matter, particularly as regards to a
reduction in the revised penalty to reflect the voluntary
self-disclosure of the issue.

     
The Registrant, along with other companies engaged in refining
and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits and
claims related to the use of the methyl tertiary butyl ether
(MTBE) in gasoline. A series of substantially identical
lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental
entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the United States
against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produce
gasoline containing MTBE, including Registrant. These cases have
been consolidated in the Southern District of New York. The
principal allegation is that gasoline containing MTBE is a
defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in
proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to
groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action
to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases
of MTBE. Additional property damage and personal injury lawsuits
and claims related to the use of MTBE are expected. Prior class
action product liability based litigation involving MTBE in
gasoline has been resolved without a material effect on the
Registrant. While the damages claimed in these actions are
substantial, Registrant has no reason to believe, based on
factual and legal circumstances currently known to the
Registrant, that these actions will have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition. However, these actions are in
their preliminary stages, and the factual and legal
circumstances may change.

In April 2003, HOVENSA received a notice of violation from the
Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources
(DPNR), relating to certain alleged wastewater permit
exceedances occurring in 2001 and 2002 at HOVENSA. The notice
proposes a fine of $219,000 and requires corrective actions to
address the alleged violations. HOVENSA is engaging in
settlement discussions with DPNR to resolve this matter.

     
The Registrant periodically receives notices from EPA that it is
a “potential responsible party” under the Superfund
legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under
this legislation, all potentially responsible parties are
jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, EPA’s
claims or assertions of liability against the Corporation
relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With
respect to the remaining sites, EPA’s claims have been
settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all
cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of
these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private
parties, on the business or accounts of the Corporation cannot
be predicted at this time due to the large number of other
potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of
clean-up cost estimates, but is not expected to be material.

     
Registrant is one of approximately 40 companies that have
received a directive from the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection to remediate contamination in the
sediments of the lower Passaic River and NJDEP is also seeking
natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects
Registrant, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk
storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey now owned by Registrant.
EPA has also issued an order relating to the same contamination.
The costs of remediation of the Passaic River are preliminary,
but NJDEP has estimated them at approximately $900 million.
Based on currently known facts and circumstances, Registrant
does not believe that this matter will result in material
liability because its terminal could not have contributed
contamination along most of the river’s length and did not
store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in
the river sediments, and because there are numerous other
parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and
damages.

     
On or about July 15, 2004, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp.
(HOVIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Registrant, and HOVENSA
L.L.C., in which Registrant owns a 50% interest, each received a
letter from the Commissioner of the Virgin Islands Department of
Planning and Natural Resources and Natural Resources Trustees,
advising of the Trustee’s intention to bring suit against
HOVIC and HOVENSA under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The letter
alleges that HOVIC and HOVENSA are potentially responsible for
damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous
substances from the “HOVENSA Oil Refinery.” HOVENSA
currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south
shore of St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands, which had been
operated by HOVIC until October 1998. The letter does not
specify the basis for the claim or a claimed damages amount. If
an action is brought, Registrant and HOVENSA intend to
vigorously defend it.

     
The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial
and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating
to other environmental matters. Although the ultimate outcome of
these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of
them may be resolved adversely to the Corporation, no such
proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. In management’s
opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances,
such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations



Overview

     
The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that
operates in two segments, exploration and production (E&P)
and refining and marketing (R&M). The E&P segment
explores for, produces and sells crude oil and natural gas. The
R&M segment manufactures, purchases, trades and markets
refined petroleum and other energy products.

     
The Corporation’s goal for the E&P segment is to grow
reserves and production profitably with its portfolio of
development projects and to deliver exploration success. During
2002 and 2003, the Corporation reshaped its E&P asset
portfolio by:









 
• 

    Selling higher cost properties predominantly in the shallow
    water Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea for proceeds of
    $738 million.


 


 
• 

    Exchanging interests in mature producing assets for increased
    interests in development stage assets in the joint development
    area of Malaysia and Thailand and deepwater Gulf of Mexico.


 


 
• 

    Participating in two oil discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of
    Mexico.


     
The asset sales and exchanges contributed significantly to the
decline in production from 451,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day in 2002 to 342,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day in 2004. In 2005, the Corporation forecasts
that crude oil and natural gas production will
average 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

     
In 2004, the Corporation continued to make progress in its
development projects that are expected to provide significant
new production in 2006 and 2007, which will more than offset
natural declines in existing fields. Milestones accomplished on
our development projects in 2004 were:









 
• 

    In April, the Llano Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico
    commenced production. The Corporation has a 50% interest in this
    field and net production at year-end is averaging approximately
    20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.


 


 
• 

    In August, the government of Equatorial Guinea approved the
    development plan for the Corporation’s Northern Block G
    fields, which is now called the Okume Complex. The Corporation
    anticipates first production in 2007.


 


 
• 

    In August, the second phase of the project to redevelop the
    Gassi El Agreb fields in Algeria was approved, resulting in an
    increased investment commitment of approximately
    $400 million. This change reflects the Corporation’s
    success in the area. Since 2000, the Corporation has increased
    gross production from 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
    day to 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.


 


 
• 

    In December, the Corporation negotiated additional gas sales
    from Block A-18 in the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area.
    The Corporation anticipates that this agreement will allow it to
    double proved reserves on the field over the next several years
    and contribute to future production growth. First sales of
    natural gas from this block under the original gas sales
    agreement began in 2005.


 


 
• 

    In December, the Corporation approved the Ujung Pangkah
    development in Indonesia. Gas sales should commence by early
    2007.


 


 
• 

    In the United Kingdom, first production from the Clair Field
    commenced in 2005 and production from the Atlantic and Cromarty
    gas fields is expected to commence in 2006. Combined net
    production from these three fields is anticipated to be at an
    annualized rate of 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
    when all three fields are onstream in 2006.


     
During 2004, the Corporation drilled successful appraisal wells
at the Shenzi prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, at the
Phu Horm Field onshore Thailand, and at Ujung Pangkah. In
December, the Corporation announced a natural gas discovery at
the Belud prospect offshore Malaysia. The Corporation has an
inventory of exploration prospects and will drill several high
impact wells in 2005.

     
The Corporation has two exploration wells currently drilling in
the Gulf of Mexico that will have estimated pre-tax capitalized
drilling costs of approximately $100 to $110 million
upon completion. If either or both of these wells are
unsuccessful, after-tax first quarter 2005 earnings would be
reduced by up to $70 million.

Proved reserves increased to 1.046 billion barrels of oil
equivalent at year-end 2004 from 1.035 billion barrels of
oil equivalent at the end of 2003. The Corporation’s
reserves included in this Form 10-K are calculated by an
independent third party reserve engineer. See further discussion
of management’s governance over the estimation of oil and
gas reserves in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on page 73.

     
The strategic goals for R&M are to maximize returns from
existing assets and generate free cash flow. The Corporation may
grow the retail and energy marketing businesses
opportunistically. During 2004 and 2003, the R&M
segment’s results improved significantly, primarily due to
higher refining margins. The HOVENSA and Port Reading refineries
operated near maximum capacity for most of the year, enabling
them to take full advantage of the strong margins.
HOVENSA’s capacity to process lower cost heavy crude oil
enhanced profitability in 2004, due to a significant price
differential between light and heavy crude oil. In 2004, the
Corporation received a cash distribution of $88 million
from HOVENSA. The HOVENSA fluid catalytic cracking unit was
shutdown for approximately 30 days of planned maintenance
in the first quarter of 2005. Planned maintenance of the fluid
catalytic cracking unit at the Port Reading facility is underway
and expected to last for approximately 30 days.

     
The Corporation’s liquidity and financial position have
improved significantly since year-end 2002. At December 31,
2002, the Corporation’s debt was $5 billion and its
debt to capitalization ratio was 54%. As of December 31,
2004, the Corporation’s debt has been reduced to
$3.8 billion and the debt to capitalization ratio was
40.7%. Aggregate debt maturities through 2006 are
$128 million. The Corporation’s cash balance at
December 31, 2004 was $877 million.

     
Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in 2004,
$1.4 billion in 2003 and $1.5 billion in 2002. Capital
expenditures for 2005 are forecast to be $2.1 billion, with
$2.0 billion dedicated to the exploration and production
segment. This higher spending reflects the Corporation’s
portfolio of organic growth projects and attractive investment
opportunities. The Corporation has hedged approximately 60% of
its 2005 worldwide crude oil production to underpin its cash
flows to fund development projects. See further discussion on
hedging starting on page 34.

In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain
transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management
reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses
after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment
earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a
preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since
they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only
the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying
the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to
pre-tax amounts.

     
The following items, on an after-tax basis, are included in
income from continuing operations for the years 2004, 2003 and

Comparison of Results

     
Exploration and Production: After considering the
exploration and production items in the preceding table, the
remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are
primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production
volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses, as
discussed below.

     
Selling prices: Higher average selling prices of
crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas increased
exploration and production revenues from continuing operations
by approximately $400 million in 2004 compared with 2003.
In 2003, the change in average selling prices increased revenues
by approximately $170 million compared with 2002. The
Corporation’s average selling prices from continuing
operations, including the effects of hedging, were as follows:

The after-tax impacts of crude oil and U.S. natural gas
hedges reduced earnings by $583 million ($935 million
before income taxes) in 2004 and $260 million
($418 million before income taxes) in 2003 compared with an
increase of $48 million ($82 million before income
taxes) in 2002.

     
The Corporation has after-tax, deferred hedge losses of
$875 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income at December 31, 2004. Of this amount,
$680 million is unrealized and relates to open hedge
positions. The remaining $195 million deferred loss is
realized and relates to closed hedge positions. The deferred
realized loss will be recognized in earnings as the underlying
barrels are sold in 2005.

     
The Corporation has open hedge positions equal to 60% of its
estimated worldwide crude oil production for 2005. The average
price per barrel for open United States crude oil hedges is
$33.06. The average price for open foreign crude oil hedges is
$31.17. Approximately 20% of the Corporation’s hedges are
WTI related and the remainder are Brent. In addition to the
gains or losses on these open hedge positions, approximately
$52 million of the $195 million deferred realized loss
will reduce first quarter 2005 earnings and the remaining
deferred realized loss will be recognized in earnings over the
balance of the year. The Corporation also has approximately
24,000 barrels per day of Brent related production hedged
from 2006 to 2012. The average price of these hedge positions is
$26.20 per barrel. There were no natural gas hedges
outstanding at December 31, 2004.

     
Production and sales volumes: The
Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas production, on a
barrel of oil equivalent basis, was 342,000 barrels per day
in 2004, 373,000 barrels per day in 2003 and
451,000 barrels per day in 2002. Approximately 50% of the
production declines in 2004 and 2003 resulted from sales and
exchanges of oil and gas producing properties. The remainder
resulted principally from natural decline, and in 2003 compared
with 2002, disappointing results from fields acquired in the
United States in 2001 and reduced production from the Ceiba
Field in Equatorial Guinea. The Corporation anticipates that its
2005 production, including anticipated production from Libya,
will be approximately 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
day. See page 27 for the current status of the discussions
on the Corporation’s return to Libya. The
Corporation’s net daily worldwide production was as follows:

Decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue from
continuing operations of approximately $75 million in 2004
compared with 2003 and lower revenue of approximately
$425 million in 2003 compared with 2002.

     
Operating costs and exploration expenses:
Operating costs and exploration expenses from continuing
operations decreased by approximately $115 million in 2004
compared with 2003 and increased by $70 million in 2003
compared with 2002. Depreciation, depletion and amortization
charges were lower in 2004 and 2003 principally reflecting
decreased production volumes. Exploration expenses were lower in
2004 as a result of lower dry hole costs. Exploration expenses
were higher in 2003, reflecting increased activity in the United
States and Equatorial Guinea, as well as additional lease cost
amortization. Production expenses increased in 2004 and 2003
primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar which
increased costs incurred in foreign currencies. In addition,
higher selling prices of crude oil and natural gas increased the
costs of production taxes, transportation, maintenance and fuel.
Unit costs per barrel totaled $17.26 in 2004, $17.32 in 2003 and
$15.11 in 2002. Unit cost per barrel includes production
expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration
expense and administrative costs.

     
Other: After-tax foreign currency gains amounted
to $6 million ($29 million before income taxes) in
2004, compared with a loss of $22 million ($4 million
before income taxes) in 2003 and income of $6 million
($26 million before income taxes) in 2002.

     
Excluding items in the following table, the effective income tax
rate for exploration and production operations in 2004 was 46%.
This includes income taxes paid in jurisdictions with rates in
excess of the United States statutory rate, such as the United
Kingdom and Norway. It also reflects an income tax deduction for
the Corporation’s hedging results at the
U.S. statutory rate. Each of these factors increases the
Corporation’s overall exploration and production effective
income tax rate. The effective income tax rate for exploration
and production operations in 2005 is expected to be in the range
of 45% to 49%. Assuming agreements are finalized and the
Corporation returns to Libya, the exploration and production
effective income tax rate will exceed the range above.

2004: The Corporation recognized gains on the sales of an
office building in Aberdeen, Scotland, a non-producing property
in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico properties. It also
recorded foreign income tax benefits resulting from a change in
tax law and a tax settlement. The Corporation accrued an
additional amount for severance and costs for vacated office
space during 2004. Additional accruals for vacated office space
of approximately $35 million before income taxes are
anticipated in 2005.

     
2003: The Corporation recorded an after-tax charge of
$32 million for accrued severance in the United States and
United Kingdom and a reduction of leased office space in London.
The pre-tax amount of this charge was $53 million, of which
$32 million relates to vacated office space. The remainder
of $21 million relates to severance for positions that were
eliminated in London, Aberdeen and Houston.

     
The Corporation recorded an income tax benefit reflecting the
recognition for United States income tax purposes of certain
prior year foreign exploration expenses. The gain from asset
sale in 2003 reflects the sale of the Corporation’s 1.5%
interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System.

     
2002: Exploration and production earnings included
after-tax asset impairments of $737 million,
$530 million of which related to the Ceiba Field in
Equatorial Guinea. The pre-tax amount of the Ceiba Field
impairment was $706 million. The charge resulted from a 12%
reduction in the estimated total field reserves that will
ultimately be produced from the field, as well as higher
anticipated development costs needed to produce the remaining
reserves at lower production rates over a longer period. The
reduction in estimated recoverable reserves was attributable to
disappointing 2002 year-end drilling results on the western
flank of the field. The reduction in probable reserves and
higher estimated future development costs resulted in an asset
impairment because projected cash flows were less than the book
value of the field, which includes allocated purchase price from
the Triton acquisition.

     
The Corporation also recorded an after-tax impairment charge of
$207 million to reduce the carrying value of oil and gas
properties located primarily in the Main Pass/ Breton Sound area
of the Gulf of Mexico. Most of these properties were obtained in
the 2001 LLOG acquisition and consisted of producing oil and gas
fields with proved and probable reserves and exploration
acreage. This charge principally reflects reduced reserve
estimates on these fields resulting from unfavorable production
performance. The fair values of producing properties were
determined by using discounted cash flows. Exploration
properties were evaluated by using results of drilling and
production data from nearby fields and seismic data for these
and other properties in the area.

     
During 2002, the United Kingdom government enacted a 10%
supplementary tax on profits from oil and gas production. A
one-time charge of $43 million was recorded to increase the
existing United Kingdom deferred tax liability on the balance
sheet.

     
The gain on asset sales in 2002 reflected the disposal of oil
and gas producing properties in the United States, United
Kingdom and Azerbaijan, and the Corporation’s energy
marketing business in the United Kingdom.

     
The Corporation’s future exploration and production
earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility
in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and
production changes and changes in tax rates.

     
Refining and Marketing: Earnings from refining and
marketing activities amounted to $451 million in 2004,
$327 million in 2003 and $85 million in 2002. The
Corporation’s downstream operations include HOVENSA L.L.C.
(HOVENSA), a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary
of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) that is accounted
for using the equity method. Additional refining and marketing
activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy
marketing and trading operations. In 2004, the Corporation
invested in a 50% joint venture, Hess LNG L.L.C., to pursue
investments in liquified natural gas terminals and related
supply, trading and marketing opportunities.

     
HOVENSA: The Corporation’s share of
HOVENSA’s income was $244 million in 2004, compared
with income of $117 million in 2003 and a loss of
$47 million in 2002. The increases in 2004 and 2003 were

22



Table of Contents

due primarily to higher refining margins compared with prior
years. HOVENSA’s total crude runs amounted to
484,000 barrels per day in 2004, 440,000 barrels per
day in 2003 and 361,000 barrels per day in 2002. In late
2002 and early 2003, crude oil deliveries to HOVENSA were
interrupted due to political disturbances in Venezuela. For the
remainder of 2003 and in 2004, HOVENSA received contracted
quantities of crude oil from PDVSA. The fluid catalytic cracking
unit at HOVENSA operated at 139,000, 142,000 and
116,000 barrels per day in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The coking unit at HOVENSA commenced production in
August 2002. The unit operated at the rate of
55,000 barrels per day in 2004 and 53,000 barrels per
day in 2003. Planned maintenance of the fluid catalytic cracking
unit at HOVENSA was completed during the first quarter of 2005.

     
Earnings from refining and marketing activities also include
interest income on the note received from PDVSA at the formation
of the joint venture. Interest on the PDVSA note amounted to
$25 million in 2004, $30 million in 2003 and
$35 million in 2002. Interest income is reflected in
non-operating income in the income statement. In 2004, the
Corporation recorded deferred income tax expense of
$32 million in refining and marketing results relating to
HOVENSA’s earnings and interest on the PDVSA note. In 2005,
the Corporation expects that deferred income taxes will be
recorded at the Virgin Islands statutory rate of 38.5%. At
December 31, 2004, the Corporation has approximately
$190 million of net operating loss carryforwards available
to offset its share of future HOVENSA taxable income.

     
Retail, Energy Marketing and Other: Retail
gasoline operations in 2004 were profitable but less so than in
2003, reflecting lower margins. Earnings from retail gasoline
operations were higher in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting
higher margins. Energy marketing earnings were lower in 2004
compared with 2003 because of lower margins. Energy marketing
activities had higher earnings in 2003, reflecting increased
margins and sales volumes in the early part of the year
resulting from the cold winter. Results of the Port Reading
refining facility improved in 2004 reflecting higher margins
than in 2003, which was also an improvement over 2002 results.
Total refined product sales volumes were 428,000 barrels
per day in 2004, 419,000 barrels per day in 2003 and
383,000 barrels per day in 2002. Planned maintenance at the
Port Reading fluid catalytic cracking unit is underway in the
first quarter of 2005.

     
The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
partnership that trades energy commodities and energy
derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for
its own account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from
trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the
trading partnership amounted to income of $37 million in
2004, $17 million in 2003 and $3 million in 2002.
Before income taxes, the trading income was $72 million in
2004, $30 million in 2003 and $6 million in 2002.

     
Marketing expenses increased in 2004 compared with 2003
reflecting higher expenses from retail operations and the
trading partnership.

     
Refining and marketing earnings include the following items:

In 2004, refining and marketing results include income of
$12 million from the liquidation of LIFO inventories. In
2003, refining and marketing earnings were reduced by a loss
from the sale of the Corporation’s interest in a shipping
joint venture. In 2002, the Corporation completed the sale of
six United States flag vessels for $161 million in cash and
a note for $29 million. The sale resulted in a net gain of
$67 million. In connection with this sale, the Corporation
agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate on these vessels
for up to five years. The support agreement requires that if the
actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is less than
the stipulated support rate in the agreement, the Corporation
will pay to the buyer the difference between the contracted rate
and the stipulated rate. At January 1, 2004, the charter
support reserve was $32 million. During 2004, the
Corporation made net payments of $4 million for charter
support. Based on contractual long-term charters and estimates
of future charter rates, the Corporation lowered the estimated
charter support reserve by $18 million in 2004. The balance
in this reserve at December 31, 2004 was $10 million.
In 2002, the Corporation recorded a charge for the write-off of
intangible assets in its U.S. energy marketing business. In
addition, severance was recorded for cost reduction initiatives
in refining and marketing, principally energy marketing.

     
Refining and marketing earnings will likely continue to be
volatile reflecting competitive industry conditions and supply
and demand factors, including the effects of weather.

     
Corporate: After-tax corporate expenses amounted
to $85 million in 2004, $101 million in 2003 and
$63 million in 2002. The 2004 corporate expenses include
$13 million ($20 million before income taxes) of
insurance costs related to retrospective premium increases. In
addition, corporate results include an income tax benefit of
$13 million from the settlement of a federal tax audit. The
2003 amount includes expenses of $34 million for premiums
paid on the repurchase of bonds compared with $6 million in
2002. The pre-tax amounts of the bond repurchase premiums were
$58 million in 2003 and $15 million in 2002 and are
recorded in non-operating income (expense) in the income
statement. Recurring after-tax corporate expenses for 2005 are
estimated to be in the range of $90 to $100 million.

     
Interest: After-tax interest expense in 2004, 2003
and 2002 was as follows:

Interest incurred decreased in 2004 and 2003 reflecting lower
average outstanding debt. After-tax interest expense in 2005 is
anticipated to be lower than the 2004 level because of higher
estimated capitalized interest.

     
Discontinued Operations: In 2003, the Corporation
exchanged its crude oil producing properties in Colombia
(acquired in 2001 as part of the Triton acquisition), plus
$10 million in cash, for an additional 25% interest in
Block A-18 in the joint development area of Malaysia and
Thailand (JDA). The exchange resulted

24


Table of Contents

in an after-tax charge to income of $47 million
($51 million before income taxes). The after-tax loss on
this exchange included a $43 million adjustment of the book
value of the Colombian assets to fair value. The loss also
included $17 million from the recognition in earnings of
the value of related hedge contracts at the time of the
exchange. These items were partially offset by after-tax
earnings in Colombia prior to the exchange of $13 million.
Income from discontinued operations of $7 million in 2004
reflects the settlement of a previously accrued contingency
relating to the Colombian asset exchange.

     
In 2003, the Corporation also sold Gulf of Mexico shelf
properties, the Jabung Field in Indonesia and several small
United Kingdom fields for $445 million. The after-tax gain
from these asset sales of $176 million ($248 million
before income taxes) was included in discontinued operations.
Discontinued operations in 2003 also included $40 million
of income from operations prior to the sales of these assets.

     
Change in Accounting Principle: The Corporation
adopted FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, effective January 1, 2003. A
net after-tax gain of $7 million resulting from the
cumulative effect of this accounting change was recorded at the
beginning of 2003. At the date of adoption, a liability of
$556 million representing the estimated fair value of the
Corporation’s required dismantlement obligations was
recorded on the balance sheet. In addition, a dismantlement
asset of $311 million was recorded, as well as accumulated
depreciation of $203 million.

     
Sales and Other Operating Revenues: In 2004, sales
and other operating revenues totaled $16,733 million, an
increase of 17% compared with 2003. This increase principally
reflects higher selling prices and sales volumes of refined
products, partially offset by decreased sales of purchased
natural gas in energy marketing. Sales and other operating
revenues increased by 24% in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting
increased sales volumes and selling prices of refined products
and the higher selling price of purchased natural gas in energy
marketing activities. The change in cost of goods sold in each
year reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined
products and purchased natural gas.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

     
Overview: Cash flows from operating activities,
including changes in operating assets and liabilities, totaled
$1,903 million in 2004. During the year, the Corporation
repaid $106 million of debt, which decreased its debt to
capitalization ratio to 40.7% at December 31, 2004 from
42.5% at December 31, 2003. Total debt was
$3,835 million at December 31, 2004 and
$3,941 million at December 31, 2003. The Corporation
has debt maturities of $128 million during the next two
years. In 2004, the Corporation entered into a new
$2.5 billion revolving credit facility, expiring in 2009.
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2004 totaled
$877 million, an increase of $359 million for the year.

     
Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Net cash
provided by operating activities, including changes in operating
assets and liabilities, totaled $1,903 million in 2004,
$1,581 million in 2003 and $1,965 million in 2002. The
increased cash flows in 2004 resulted primarily from higher
earnings and the timing of cash flows associated with changes in
operating assets and liabilities. In 2004, the Corporation also
received a cash distribution of $88 million from HOVENSA.
Lower cash flows in 2003 were primarily due to reduced
exploration and production sales volumes. Changes in operating
assets and liabilities increased cash flow by $230 million
in 2004 and decreased cash flow by $120 million in 2003.

Proceeds from asset sales in 2004 totaled $57 million. In
2003, the Corporation sold certain producing properties in the
Gulf of Mexico Shelf, the Jabung Field in Indonesia, several
small United Kingdom fields and an interest in a shipping joint
venture. Proceeds from asset sales totaled $545 million in
2003. In addition, the Corporation completed several asset
exchanges. The Corporation swapped mature, high-cost assets in
Colombia for an additional 25% interest in long-lived natural
gas reserves in Block A-18 in the joint development area of
Malaysia and Thailand, bringing the Corporation’s interest
in the area to 50%. The Corporation exchanged its 25% equity
investment in Premier Oil plc for a 23% interest in Natuna Sea
Block A in Indonesia, plus approximately $10 million in
cash. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Corporation exchanged
14% interests in the Scott and Telford fields in the United
Kingdom for an additional 22.5% interest in the Llano Field in
the Gulf of Mexico and $17 million in cash. This exchange
increased the Corporation’s working interest in the Llano
Field to 50% and decreased its interest in the Scott Field to
21% and the Telford Field to 17%. The net production from fields
sold or exchanged in 2003 at the time of disposition was
approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

     
In 2002, the Corporation sold six United States Flag vessels,
its energy marketing business in the United Kingdom and several
small oil and gas fields for net proceeds of $412 million.

     
Cash Flows from Financing Activities: The
Corporation reduced debt by $106 million in 2004,
$1,051 million in 2003 and $673 million in 2002. The
debt reduction in 2004 was due to cash flow from operations. In
2003, debt was reduced by proceeds from the issuance of
preferred stock and from asset sales, as well as cash flow from
operations. In 2003, the Corporation issued
13,500,000 shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock
for net proceeds of $653 million. In 2004, the Corporation
received proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling
$90 million. Dividends paid were $157 million in 2004,
$108 million in 2003 and $107 million in 2002. The
increase in 2004 was due to dividends on the 7% preferred stock
issued in the fourth quarter of 2003.

     
Future Capital Requirements and Resources: Capital
expenditures in 2005 are expected to be approximately
$2.1 billion, including an estimated amount for re-entering
Libya. The Corporation anticipates that these expenditures will
be funded by available cash and cash flow from operations,
however, revolving credit facilities are available, if necessary.

     
With higher crude oil prices, the Corporation’s collateral
requirements under certain contracts with hedging and trading
counterparties have increased. Outstanding letters of credit
were $1,487 million at December 31, 2004, including
$570 million drawn against the Corporation’s
$2.5 billion syndicated, revolving credit facility,
compared with outstanding letters of credit of $229 million
at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the
Corporation has $1,930 million available under its
committed revolving credit

26


Table of Contents

agreement and has additional unused lines of credit of
approximately $150 million, primarily for letters of
credit, under uncommitted arrangements with banks. The
Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may
issue $825 million of additional debt securities, warrants,
common stock or preferred stock.

     
Loan agreement covenants allow the Corporation to borrow an
additional $5.5 billion for the construction or acquisition
of assets at December 31, 2004. At year end, the maximum
amount of dividends or stock repurchases that can be paid from
borrowings under the loan agreements is $2.0 billion.

     
The Corporation’s aggregate maturities of long-term debt
total $128 million over the next two years. Based on
current estimates of production, capital expenditures and other
factors, and assuming West Texas Intermediate oil prices average
$35 per barrel and United States natural gas prices average
$6 per Mcf, the Corporation anticipates it will fund its
2005 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends and
required debt repayments, with existing cash on-hand and cash
flow from operations. If necessary, additional financing is
available from its revolving credit facility and shelf
registration.

     
Libya: Prior to June 30, 1986, the
Corporation had extensive exploration and production operations
in Libya; however, U.S. government sanctions required
suspension of participation in these operations. The Corporation
wrote off the book value of its Libyan assets in connection with
the cessation of operations. During 2004, the Corporation
received U.S. government authorization to negotiate and
execute an agreement with the government of Libya that would
define the terms for resuming active participation in the Libyan
properties. The U.S. Government has lifted most of the
sanctions imposed on Libya and has rescinded the Libya portions
of the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1976. As a result, the
Corporation and its partners will be able to resume operations
in Libya if they are able to reach a successful conclusion to
ongoing commercial negotiations.

     
Repatriation Provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004: On October 22, 2004, the President signed
the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) that effectively
provides for a one-time reduction of the income tax rate to
5.25% on eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a
U.S. parent. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the
Corporation decided to repatriate approximately
$1.3 billion of unremitted foreign earnings. As a result,
the Corporation expects to record a tax provision of
approximately $41 million in the first quarter of 2005. Had
the additional taxes been recorded at the end of 2004, net
income would have been $936 million ($9.93 per share
basic and $9.17 per share diluted). The Corporation is
reviewing the possibility of additional repatriations during
2005. The maximum additional amount that the Corporation could
repatriate under the Act is approximately $600 million. The
Corporation estimates that an additional tax provision of up to
$32 million would be recorded, depending on the incremental
amount distributed, if any.

     
Credit Ratings: In 2004, two credit rating
agencies downgraded their ratings of the Corporation’s
debt. One of the revised ratings was below investment grade. If
another rating agency were to reduce its credit rating below
investment grade, the Corporation would have to comply with a
more stringent financial covenant contained in its revolving
credit facility. In addition, the incremental margin
requirements with hedging and trading counterparties at
December 31, 2004 would be approximately $23 million.

The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined
    product supply from HOVENSA. Current purchases amount to
    approximately $2.4 billion annually.


27



Table of Contents
    
In the preceding table, the Corporation’s supply
commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of
HOVENSA’s production of refined products, after anticipated
sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. Also included are
normal term purchase agreements at market prices for additional
gasoline necessary to supply the Corporation’s retail
marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining
facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to
purchase natural gas for use in supplying contracted customers
in its energy marketing business. These commitments were
computed based on year-end market prices.

     
The table also reflects that portion of the Corporation’s
planned capital expenditures that are contractually committed at
December 31. The Corporation’s 2005 capital
expenditures are estimated to be approximately
$2.1 billion. Obligations for operating expenses include
commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas
production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other
long-term liabilities reflect contractually committed
obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, including
minimum pension plan funding requirements.

     
In connection with the sale of six vessels in 2002, the
Corporation agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate on
these vessels for up to five years. The support agreement
requires that if the actual contracted rate for the charter of a
vessel is less than the stipulated support rate in the
agreement, the Corporation will pay to the buyer the difference
between the contracted rate and the stipulated rate. The balance
in the charter support reserve at December 31, 2004 was
$10 million.

     
The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation to acquire
the remaining 50% interest in a retail marketing and gasoline
station joint venture for approximately $90 million.

     
The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of
HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than
PDVSA. The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates
based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices
and at December 31, 2004 amounted to $97 million. In
addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a
maximum of $40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have
funds to meet its senior debt obligations.

     
At December 31, the Corporation has $1,415 million of
letters of credit principally relating to accrued liabilities
with hedging and trading counterparties recorded on its balance
sheet. In addition, the Corporation is contingently liable under
letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other
entities directly related to its business, as follows:

    relates principally to loan guarantees —
    $55 million for a natural gas pipeline in which the
    Corporation owns a 5% interest and $45 million for an oil
    pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 2.36% interest.


    
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Corporation
has leveraged lease financings not included in its balance
sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the
Corporation operates. The net present value of these financings
is $467 million at December 31, 2004 compared with
$462 million at December 31, 2003. The
Corporation’s December 31, 2004 debt to capitalization
ratio would increase from 40.7% to 43.5% if the lease financings
were included as debt.

Contingencies” above, Note 5, “Refining Joint
Venture,” and Note 16, “Guarantees and
Contingencies,” in the financial statements.

Foreign Operations: The Corporation conducts
exploration and production activities in many foreign countries,
including the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Gabon, Indonesia,
Thailand, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Malaysia and Equatorial Guinea.
Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated
with foreign operations. These exposures include political risk
(including tax law changes) and currency risk. The effects of
these events are accounted for when they occur and generally
have not been material to the Corporation’s liquidity or
financial position.

     
HOVENSA L.L.C., owned 50% by the Corporation and 50% by
Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), owns and operates a
refinery in the Virgin Islands. Although there have in the past
been political disruptions in Venezuela that reduced the
availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining
operations, these disruptions did not have a material adverse
effect on the Corporation’s financial position. The
Corporation also has a note receivable of $273 million at
December 31, 2004 from a subsidiary of PDVSA. The
Corporation anticipates collection of the remaining balance.


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

     
Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of
assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet
and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The
accounting methods used can affect net income,
stockholders’ equity and various financial statement
ratios. However, the Corporation’s accounting policies
generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.

     
Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs:
Oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted
for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring
unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including
lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs, are
capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and
exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of
drilling and equipping productive wells, including development
dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized.

     
The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
have been found. In an area requiring a major capital
expenditure before production can begin, an exploration well is
carried as an asset if sufficient reserves are discovered to
justify its completion as a production well, and additional
exploration drilling is underway or firmly planned. The
Corporation does not capitalize the cost of other exploratory
wells for more than one year unless proved reserves are found.

     
Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The
determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant
element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration
and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves
affect well capitalizations, undeveloped leasehold impairments
and the unit of production depreciation rates of proved
properties, wells and equipment. Reductions in reserve estimates
may result in the need for increased depreciation or impairments
of proved properties and related assets.

     
The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in
accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the
requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For
reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially
producible, government approvals must be obtained and depending
on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the
board of directors must commit to fund the project. The
Corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting
process involves an annual independent third party reserve
determination as well as internal technical appraisals of
reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve
estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work
directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s
technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year
based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new
technical data and other studies. To provide consistency
throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation
guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval
practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject
to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the
estimates.

     
The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary
Oil and Gas Data in accordance with FAS No. 69 are
determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and
MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal
estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with
engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production
histories and other information necessary for the reserve

29



Table of Contents

determination. The Corporation’s and D&M’s
technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information
provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review
the final reserve estimates issued by D&M.

     
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill: As
explained below there are significant differences in the way
long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for
impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long-lived assets,
including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may
not be recovered. Long-lived assets are tested at the lowest
level for which cash flows are identifiable and are largely
independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not
expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow
estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is
recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated
fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated
future net cash flows.

     
In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future
net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of
future prices, which is determined with reference to recent
historical prices and published forward prices, applied to
projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted
at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected
production volumes represent reserves, including probable
reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount
of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and
timing of production are consistent with internal projections
and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices
used for determining asset impairments will generally differ
from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future
net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use
of actual prices on the last day of the year.

     
The Corporation’s impairment tests of long-lived
exploration and production producing assets are based on its
best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery
factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs and the
timing of future production, which are updated each time an
impairment test is performed. In 2002, the Corporation recorded
impairments of the Ceiba Field and LLOG properties that were
required primarily because of reduced estimates of oil and gas
production volumes and, in the case of Ceiba, anticipated
additional development costs. The impairment charges did not
result from changes in the other factors. The change in the
estimated timing of production on the Ceiba Field did not
significantly affect the undiscounted future cash flows, but did
significantly reduce the fair value of the field determined by
discounted cash flows. The Corporation could have additional
impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas
fields were reduced. Significant extended declines in crude oil
and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset
impairments.

     
The Corporation recorded $977 million of goodwill in
connection with the purchase of Triton Energy Limited in 2001.
Factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill included the
strategic value of expanding global operations to access new
growth areas outside of the United States and the North Sea,
obtaining critical mass in Africa and Southeast Asia, and
synergies, including cost savings, improved processes and
portfolio high grading opportunities. In accordance with
FAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but must
be tested for impairment annually. FAS No. 142
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at a reporting
unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and
measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from
the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is
an operating segment or a component that is one level below an
operating segment. A component is a reporting unit if the
component constitutes a business for which discrete financial
information is available and segment management regularly
reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or
more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and
deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar
economic characteristics. An operating segment shall be deemed a
reporting unit if all of its components are economically similar.

     
Within the Corporation’s exploration and production
operating segment there are currently two components:
(1) Americas and West Africa and (2) Europe, North
Africa and Asia. Each component has a manager who reports to the
segment manager. The Corporation has determined the components
have similar economic characteristics and, therefore, has
aggregated the components into a single reporting
unit — the exploration and production operating
segment. As a result, goodwill has been assigned to the
exploration and production operating segment. If the Corporation
reorganized its exploration and production business such

30



Table of Contents

that there was more than one operating segment, or its
components were no longer economically similar, goodwill would
be assigned to two or more reporting units. The goodwill would
be allocated to any new reporting units using a relative fair
value approach in accordance with FAS No. 142.
Goodwill impairment testing for lower level reporting units
could result in the recognition of an impairment that would not
otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of
aggregation.

     
The Corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be
recovered through the operation of the exploration and
production segment as a whole and it evaluated the following
characteristics in determining that the components are
economically similar:









 
• 

    The Corporation operates its exploration and production segment
    as a single, global business.


 


 
• 

    Each component produces oil and gas.


 


 
• 

    The exploration and production processes are similar in each
    component.


 


 
• 

    The methods used by each component to market and distribute oil
    and gas are similar.


 


 
• 

    Customers of each component are similar.


 


 
• 

    The components share resources and are supported by a worldwide
    exploration team and a shared services organization.


     
The Corporation’s fair value estimate of the exploration
and production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted
anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known
developments, (2) the expected risked present value of
exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to
reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential
synergies including cost savings, access to new business
opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and
increased market share. The Corporation also considers the
relative market valuation of similar exploration and production
companies.

     
The determination of the fair value of the exploration and
production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and
gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and
market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and
natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a
decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production
operating segment that could result in an impairment of
goodwill. In addition, changes in management structure or sales
or dispositions of a portion of the exploration and production
segment may result in goodwill impairment.

     
Because there are significant differences in the way long-lived
assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment
testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that
would not cause an impairment of the $977 million of
goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment. In
2002, the Corporation recognized asset impairments because
reduced estimates of oil and gas production volumes caused the
expected undiscounted cash flows of the assets to be lower than
the asset carrying amounts. No impairment of goodwill existed
because the fair value of the overall exploration and production
operating segment continued to exceed its recorded book value.

     
Segments: The Corporation has two operating
segments, exploration and production, and refining and
marketing. Management has determined that these are its
operating segments because, in accordance with
FAS No. 131, these are the segments of the Corporation
(i) that engage in business activities from which revenues
are earned and expenses are incurred, (ii) whose operating
results are regularly reviewed by the Corporation’s chief
operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be
allocated to the segment and assess its performance and
(iii) for which discrete financial information is
available. The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
of the Corporation, is the chief operating decision maker (CODM)
as defined in FAS No. 131, because he is responsible
for performing the functions within the Corporation of
allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, the
Corporation’s operating segments. The CODM uses only the
operating results of each segment as a whole to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to each segment and to assess
the segment performance. The CODM manages each segment globally
and does not regularly review the operating results of any
component (e.g., geographic area) or asset within each

31


Table of Contents

segment or any such information by geographical location, oil
and gas property or project, subsidiary or division, to make
decisions about resources to be allocated or to assess
performance. While the CODM does review and approve initial
corporate funding for a new project using information about the
project, he does not review subsequent operating results by
project after the initial funding. Each operating segment has
one manager. The segment managers are responsible for allocating
resources within the segments, reviewing financial results of
components within the segments, and assessing the performance of
the components. The CODM evaluates the performance of the
segment managers based on performance metrics related to each
manager’s operating segment as a whole. The Board of
Directors of the Corporation does not receive more detailed
information than that used by the CODM to operate and manage the
Corporation.

     
Hedging: The Corporation may use futures,
forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to
reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and
refined product selling prices. Related hedge gains or losses
are an integral part of the selling or purchase prices.
Generally, these derivatives are designated as hedges of
expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow
hedges), and the changes in fair value are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income. These transactions meet
the requirements for hedge accounting, including correlation.
The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included
in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings at the
time the hedged transactions are recognized. The ineffective
portion of hedges is included in current earnings. The
Corporation’s remaining derivatives, including foreign
currency contracts, are not designated as hedges and the change
in fair value is included in income currently. At
December 31, 2004, the Corporation has $875 million of
deferred exploration and production hedging losses, after income
taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income.

     
Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the
determination and recognition of income tax assets and
liabilities in the financial statements. The Corporation has net
operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including
the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for
those losses. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax
assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and
tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments
are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being
realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance
is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that
will be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax
assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for
temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net
operating losses, estimates of future taxable income, the
availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of
appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future
taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves
and selling prices that are consistent with the
Corporation’s internal business forecasts.


Environment, Health and Safety

     
The Corporation has implemented a values-based,
socially-responsible strategy focused on improving environment,
health and safety performance and making a positive impact on
communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporation’s
environment, health, safety and social responsibility policies
and by environment and safety management systems that help
protect the Corporation’s workforce, customers and local
communities. The Corporation’s management systems are based
on international standards and are intended to promote internal
consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual
improvement in EHS performance. Improved performance may
increase the Corporation’s operating costs and could also
require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks
to assets, reputation and license to operate. While overall
governance is the responsibility of senior management, the
Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory
compliance, audit facilities, train employees and to generally
meet corporate EHS goals.

     
The Port Reading refining facility and the HOVENSA refinery
manufacture conventional and reformulated gasolines that are
cleaner burning than that required under current
U.S. regulations. The production of motor and other fuels
in the United States and elsewhere has faced increasing
regulatory pressures to reduce sulfur content in recent years.
In 2004, new regulations went into effect that significantly
reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional rules to reduce
the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel will go into effect
in 2006. Fuels production will likely continue to be subject to
more stringent regulation in future years and as such may
require additional large capital expenditures.

32



Table of Contents
     
The Corporation and HOVENSA continue to evaluate options to
determine the most cost effective compliance strategies for
known fuel regulations. Estimated capital expenditures necessary
to comply with low-sulfur gasoline requirements at Port Reading
are approximately $70 million over the next two years.
Capital expenditures to comply with low-sulfur gasoline and
diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are presently expected to be
approximately $400 million in total, $50 million of
which has already been spent. Remaining capital expenditures are
projected to be $350 million over the next two years.
HOVENSA plans to finance these capital expenditures through cash
flow from operations. If it becomes necessary to finance a
portion of the capital expenditures, HOVENSA has
$400 million of available revolving credit capacity.

     
Federal legislation to restrict or ban the use of MTBE, a
gasoline oxygenate, and to require the use of
‘renewable’ fuels was considered by the United States
Congress in 2004 and will likely be reconsidered in 2005. The
Corporation and HOVENSA both manufacture and use MTBE, where
permitted, to meet the federal requirement for oxygen in
reformulated gasoline. In states within the Corporation’s
marketing area where MTBE bans have been enacted, such as
Connecticut and New York, the Corporation markets reformulated
gasoline without oxygenates and ethanol is added to the gasoline
downstream from the refineries to meet regulatory requirements.
If Congress bans MTBE nationally or if additional state bans
take effect, or if an obligation to use ethanol or other
renewable fuels is imposed, the effect on the Corporation and
HOVENSA could be significant. Whether the effect is significant
will depend on several factors, including the extent and timing
of any such bans of MTBE or obligations to use ethanol,
requirements for maintenance of certain air emission reductions
if MTBE is banned, the cost and availability of alternative
oxygenates or credits and whether the minimum oxygen content
standard for reformulated gasoline remains in effect. The
Corporation will continue to review various options to market
and produce reformulated gasolines if additional MTBE bans take
effect.

     
As described in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” in
2003, the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the
U.S. EPA regarding the EPA’s Petroleum Refining
Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed
to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries.
Since 2000, EPA has entered into settlements addressing these
emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over
50% of the nation’s refining capacity in 26 states and
negotiations continue with many refiners. Depending on the
outcome of these discussions, the Corporation and HOVENSA may
experience increased capital and operating expenses related to
air emissions controls. The PRI allows for controls to be phased
in over several years.

     
The Corporation recognizes the worldwide concern about the
environmental and social impact of air emissions. On a global
scale, climate change is an issue that has prompted much public
debate and has a potential impact on future economic growth and
development. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess,
monitor and reduce the emission of “greenhouse gases,”
including carbon dioxide and methane. The challenges associated
with this program may be significant, not only from the
standpoint of technical feasibility, but also from the
perspective of adequately measuring the Corporation’s
entire greenhouse gas inventory.

     
The Corporation expects continuing expenditures for
environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to
existing conditions. Sites where corrective action may be
necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore
exploration and production facilities, refineries (including
solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not
currently significant, “Superfund” sites where the
Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party.

     
The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and
remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and
reasonably estimable. At year-end 2004, the Corporation’s
reserve for its estimated environmental liability was
approximately $81 million. The Corporation does not
discount its environmental liability. The Corporation expects
that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will
adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites.
Remediation spending was $12 million in 2004 and 2003 and
$9 million in 2002. Capital expenditures for facilities,
primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental
standards, were $1 million in 2004, $7 million in 2003 and
$5 million in 2002.

Forward Looking Information

     
Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including
references to the Corporation’s future results of
operations and financial position, liquidity and capital

the Corporation’s current understanding and assessment of
these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future.
Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of
changes in market conditions, government actions and other
factors.












Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk


     
In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed
to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil,
natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to
changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the
disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as
non-trading activities. The Corporation also has trading
operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a
trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to
commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil,
natural gas and refined products. The following describes how
these risks are controlled and managed.

     
Controls: The Corporation maintains a control
environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and
through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporation’s
senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric,
term and value-at-risk limits. In addition, the chief risk
officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities.
Risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to
business units and to senior management. The Corporation’s
risk management department also performs independent
verifications of sources of fair values and validations of
valuation models. These controls apply to all of the
Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities, including
the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporation’s
treasury department administers foreign exchange rate and
interest rate hedging programs.

     
Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses
forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts,
futures, swaps, options and energy commodity linked securities
in its non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are
widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms. The
following describes these instruments and how the Corporation
uses them:









 
• 

Forward Commodity Contracts: The forward purchase and
    sale of commodities is performed as part of the
    Corporation’s normal activities. At title date, the
    notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical
    delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are designated
    as normal purchase and sale contracts under
    FAS No. 133 are excluded from the quantitative market
    risk disclosures.


 


 
• 

Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: Forward contracts
    include forward purchase contracts for both the British pound
    sterling and the Danish kroner. These foreign currency contracts
    commit the Corporation to purchase a fixed amount of pound
    sterling and kroner at a predetermined exchange rate on a
    certain date.


 


 
• 

Futures: The Corporation uses exchange traded futures
    contracts on a number of different underlying energy
    commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant
    exchange and are subject to exchange position limits.


 


 
• 

Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap
    contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading
    activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based
    on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over
    the life of the contract.


 


 
• 

Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities
    include exchange traded and third party contracts and have
    various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the
    Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk
    of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying
    the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a
    premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the
    favorable price movements in the underlying commodities.


34


Table of Contents








 
• 

Energy Commodity Linked Securities: Securities where the
    price is linked to the price of an underlying energy commodity.
    These securities may be issued by a company or government.


     
Quantitative Measures: The Corporation uses
value-at-risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its
trading and non-trading activities. The value-at-risk model uses
historical simulation and the results represent the potential
loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The
model captures both first and second order sensitivities for
options. The potential change in fair value based on commodity
price risk is presented in the non-trading and trading sections
below.

     
For foreign exchange rate risk, the impact of a 10% change in
foreign exchange rates on the value of the Corporation’s
portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts is presented in
the non-trading section. Similarly, the impact of a 15% change
in interest rates on the fair value of the Corporation’s
debt is also presented in the non-trading section. A 10% change
in foreign exchange rates and a 15% change in the rate of
interest over one year are considered reasonable possibilities
for providing sensitivity disclosures.

     
Non-Trading: The Corporation’s non-trading
activities include hedging of crude oil and natural gas
production. Futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices
of a portion of the Corporation’s future production and the
related gains or losses are an integral part of the
Corporation’s selling prices. As of December 31, the
Corporation has open hedge positions equal to 60% of its
estimated 2005 worldwide crude oil production. The average price
for West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) related open hedge
positions is $33.06. The average price for Brent crude oil
related open hedge positions is $31.17. Approximately 20% of the
Corporation’s hedges is WTI related and the remainder is
Brent. In addition, the Corporation has approximately
24,000 barrels per day of Brent related crude oil
production hedged from 2006 through 2012 at an average price of
$26.20 per barrel. There were no hedges of natural gas
production at year end. As market conditions change, the
Corporation may adjust its hedge percentages.

     
Because the selling price of crude oil has increased during
2004, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at
December 31, 2004 includes after-tax deferred losses of
$875 million ($195 million of realized losses and
$680 million of unrealized losses) related to crude oil
contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales.
Realized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income
represent losses on closed contracts that are deferred until the
underlying barrels are sold. In addition to the impact of the
open hedge positions described above, approximately
$52 million of the realized losses will reduce earnings in
the first quarter of 2005 and the remainder will reduce earnings
during the balance of 2005. The pre-tax amount of all deferred
hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related
income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the
balance sheet.

     
The Corporation also markets energy commodities including
refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The
Corporation uses futures and swaps to fix the purchase prices of
commodities to be sold under fixed-price sales contracts.

     
The following table summarizes the value-at-risk results of
commodity related derivatives that are settled in cash and used
in non-trading activities. The results may vary from time to
time as hedge levels change.

The increase in the value at risk in 2004 principally reflects
additional hedge positions on Brent related production for the
years 2006 through 2012.

     
The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its
exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into
forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling
and the Danish kroner. At December 31, 2004, the
Corporation has $476 million of notional value foreign
exchange contracts maturing in 2005 ($384 million at
December 31, 2003). The fair value of foreign exchange
contracts recorded as assets was $49 million at
December 31, 2004 ($40 million at December 31,
2003). The change in fair value of the foreign exchange
contracts from a 10% change in exchange rates is estimated to be
$53 million at December 31, 2004 ($43 million at
December 31, 2003).

     
At December 31, 2004, the interest rate on substantially
all of the Corporation’s debt was fixed and there were no
interest rate swaps. The Corporation’s outstanding debt of
$3,835 million has a fair value of $4,327 million at
December 31, 2004 (debt of $3,941 million at
December 31, 2003 had a fair value of $4,440 million).
A 15% change in the rate of interest would change the fair value
of debt by approximately $260 million at December 31,
2004 and by approximately $270 million at December 31,
2003.

     
Trading: The trading partnership in which the
Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy commodities
and derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are
consolidated with those of the Corporation. The Corporation also
takes trading positions for its own account. These strategies
include proprietary position management and trading to enhance
the potential return on assets. The information that follows
represents 100% of the trading partnership and the
Corporation’s proprietary trading accounts.

     
In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in
crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices, primarily in
North America and Europe. Trading positions include futures,
forwards, swaps and options. In some cases, physical purchase
and sale contracts are used as trading instruments and are
included in the trading results.

     
Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at
the time of sale. Derivative trading transactions are
marked-to-market and are reflected in income currently. Total
realized gains for the year amounted to $79 million. The
following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting
the changes in fair value of trading activities and represents
100% of the trading partnership and other trading activities.

The Corporation uses observable market values for determining
the fair value of its trading instruments. In cases where
actively quoted prices are not available, other external sources
are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in
actively quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets
and other market fundamental analysis. Internal estimates are
based on internal models incorporating underlying market
information such as commodity volatilities and correlations. The
Corporation’s risk management department

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

     
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting,
as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, based
on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2004.

     
Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, has been audited by Ernst &
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


The Board of Directors and Stockholders


Amerada Hess Corporation

     
We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that Amerada Hess Corporation and
consolidated subsidiaries maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Amerada Hess
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

     
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

     
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

     
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

     
In our opinion, management’s assessment that Amerada Hess
Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion,
Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
the COSO criteria.

     
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Amerada Hess
Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of
consolidated income, retained earnings, cash flows, changes in
preferred stock, common stock and capital in excess of par value
and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2004, and our report dated
February 21, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on these
statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


The Board of Directors and Stockholders


Amerada Hess Corporation

     
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of
consolidated income, retained earnings, cash flows, changes in
preferred stock, common stock and capital in excess of par value
and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included
the Financial Statement Schedule listed in the Index at
Item 8. These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

     
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Amerada Hess Corporation and consolidated
subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related Financial Statement Schedule, when considered in
relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information
set forth therein.

     
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, effective January 1, 2003.

     
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Amerada Hess Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES






NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS








1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


     
Nature of Business: Amerada Hess Corporation and
subsidiaries (the Corporation) engage in the exploration for and
the production, purchase, transportation and sale of crude oil
and natural gas. These activities are conducted in the United
States, United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea,
Algeria, Azerbaijan, Gabon, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and
other countries. In addition, the Corporation manufactures,
purchases, transports, trades and markets refined petroleum and
other energy products. The Corporation owns 50% of HOVENSA
L.L.C., a refinery joint venture in the United States Virgin
Islands. An additional refining facility, terminals and retail
gasoline stations are located on the East Coast of the United
States.

     
In preparing financial statements, management makes estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses in
the income statement. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Among the estimates made by management are oil and
gas reserves, asset valuations, depreciable lives, pension
liabilities, environmental obligations, dismantlement costs and
income taxes.

     
Certain information in the financial statements and notes has
been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

     
Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Amerada Hess
Corporation and entities in which the Corporation owns more than
a 50% voting interest or entities that the Corporation controls.
The Corporation’s undivided interests in unincorporated oil
and gas exploration and production ventures are proportionately
consolidated.

     
Investments in affiliated companies, 20% to 50% owned, including
HOVENSA but excluding a trading partnership, are stated at cost
of acquisition plus the Corporation’s equity in
undistributed net income since acquisition. The change in the
equity in net income of these companies is included in
non-operating income in the income statement. The Corporation
consolidates the trading partnership in which it owns a 50%
voting interest and over which it exercises control.

     
Intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in
consolidation.

     
Revenue Recognition: The Corporation recognizes
revenues from the sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum
products and other merchandise when title passes to the
customer. The Corporation recognizes revenues from the
production of natural gas properties based on sales to
customers. Differences between natural gas volumes sold and the
Corporation’s share of natural gas production are not
material.

     
In its exploration and production activities, the Corporation
enters into buy-sell arrangements for crude oil that involve
linked sale and purchase transactions for the primary purpose of
changing location or quality. These arrangements are reported
net in the income statement. In its refining and marketing
activities, the Corporation exchanges refined products with
other oil companies and enters into buy-sell arrangements that
involve linked sale and purchase transactions with the same
counterparty for the purpose of changing location and quality.
These arrangements are reported net in the income statement. The
amount of netted buy-sell transactions is less than 10% of sales
in each year in the three year period ended December 31,
2004.

     
Derivatives (futures, forwards, options and swaps) used in
energy trading activities are marked to market, with net gains
and losses recorded in operating revenue. Gains or losses from
the sale of physical products are recorded at the time of sale.

     
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents
consist of highly liquid investments, which are readily
convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or
less when acquired.

     
Inventories: Crude oil and refined product
inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market.
For inventories valued at cost, the Corporation uses principally
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory method.

AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

     
Inventories of merchandise, materials and supplies are valued at
the lower of average cost or market.

     
Exploration and Development Costs: Oil and gas
exploration and production activities are accounted for using
the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and
proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses,
brokers’ fees and other related costs, are capitalized.
Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry
hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and
equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and
related production facilities are capitalized.

     
The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves
are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
have been found. In an area requiring a major capital
expenditure before production can begin, an exploration well is
carried as an asset if sufficient reserves are discovered to
justify its completion as a production well, and additional
exploration drilling is underway or firmly planned. The
Corporation does not capitalize the cost of other exploratory
wells for more than one year unless proved reserves are found.

     
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: The
Corporation calculates depletion expense for acquisition costs
of proved properties using the units of production method over
proved oil and gas reserves. Depreciation and depletion expense
for oil and gas production equipment and wells is calculated
using the units of production method over proved developed oil
and gas reserves. Depreciation of all other plant and equipment
is determined on the straight-line method based on estimated
useful lives. Provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and
gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors.

     
Asset Retirement Obligations: On January 1,
2003, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for asset
retirement obligations as required by FAS No. 143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Previously,
the Corporation had accrued the estimated costs of
dismantlement, restoration and abandonment, less estimated
salvage values, of offshore oil and gas production platforms and
pipelines using the units-of-production method. This cost was
reported as a component of depreciation expense and accumulated
depreciation. Using the new accounting method required by
FAS No. 143, the Corporation recognizes a liability
for the fair value of legally required asset retirement
obligations associated with long-lived assets in the period in
which the retirement obligations are incurred. The Corporation
capitalizes the associated asset retirement costs as part of the
carrying amount of the long-lived assets. The cumulative effect
of this change on prior years resulted in a credit to income of
$7 million or $.07 per share, basic and diluted. The
cumulative effect is included in income for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The effect of the change on the year
2003 was to increase income before the cumulative effect of the
accounting change by $3 million, after-tax ($.03 per
share diluted).

     
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The Corporation
reviews long-lived assets, including oil and gas properties at a
field level, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
recovered. If the carrying amounts are not expected to be
recovered by undiscounted future cash flows, the assets are
impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of
impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets
determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In
the case of oil and gas fields, the net present value of future
cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future
prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical
prices and published forward prices, applied to projected
production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risks involved. The projected production
volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves,
expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital
expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of
production are consistent with internal projections and other
externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for
determining asset impairments will generally differ from the
year-end prices used in the standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows.

     
Impairment of Equity Investees: The Corporation
reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than
temporary decline in value has

48



Table of Contents

AMERADA HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)


occurred. The amount of the impairment is based on quoted market
prices, where available, or other valuation techniques,
including discounted cash flows.

     
Impairment of Goodwill: In accordance with
FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, goodwill cannot be amortized; however, it must be
tested annually for impairment. This impairment test is
calculated at the reporting unit level, which is the exploration
and production segment for the Corporation’s goodwill. The
Corporation identifies potential impairments by comparing the
fair value of the reporting unit to its book value, including
goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the
carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value
exceeds the fair value, the Corporation calculates the possible
impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill
with the carrying amount. If the implied fair value of goodwill
is less than the carrying amount, an impairment would be
recorded.

     
Maintenance and Repairs: The estimated costs of
major maintenance, including turnarounds at the Port Reading
refining facility, are accrued. Other expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Capital
improvements are recorded as additions to property, plant and
equipment.

     
Environmental Expenditures: The Corporation
capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase the life or
efficiency of property or that reduce or prevent environmental
contamination. The Corporation accrues environmental expenses to
remediate existing conditions related to past operations when
the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable.

     
Stock-Based Compensation: The Corporation records
compensation expense for restricted common stock awards ratably
over the vesting period. The Corporation uses the intrinsic
value method to account for employee stock options. Because the
exercise prices of employee stock options equal or exceed the
market price of the stock on the date of grant, the Corporation
does not recognize compensation expense (see Note 9). The
following pro forma financial information presents the effect on
net income and earnings per share as if the Corporation used the
fair value method for stock options.

Foreign Currency Translation: The U.S. dollar
is the functional currency (primary currency in which business
is conducted) for most foreign operations. For these operations,
adjustments resulting from translating foreign currency assets
and liabilities into U.S. dollars are recorded in income.
For operations that use the local currency as the functional
currency, adjustments resulting from translating foreign
functional currency assets and liabilities into
U.S. dollars are recorded in a separate component of
stockholders’ equity

STATEMENTS — (Continued)


entitled accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains or losses
resulting from transactions in other than the functional
currency are reflected in net income.

     
Hedging: The Corporation may use futures,
forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to
reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and
refined product selling prices. Related hedge gains or losses
are an integral part of the selling or purchase prices.
Generally, these derivatives are designated as hedges of
expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow
hedges), and the changes in fair value are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income. These transactions meet
the requirements for hedge accounting, including correlation.
The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included
in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings at the
time the hedged transactions are recognized. The ineffective
portion of hedges is included in current earnings. The
Corporation’s remaining derivatives, including foreign
currency contracts, are not designated as hedges and the change
in fair value is included in income currently.

     
Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are determined
using the liability method. The Corporation regularly assesses
the realizability of deferred tax assets, based on estimates of
future taxable income, the availability of tax planning
strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, the available
carryforward periods for net operating losses and other factors.
The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income
taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations.

     
Accounting Change: The Corporation has adopted
Emerging Issues Task Force abstract 02-3, Issues
Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading
Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk
Management Activities. In accordance with EITF 02-3,
the Corporation began accounting for trading inventory purchased
after October 25, 2002 at the lower of cost or market.
Inventory purchased prior to this date was marked-to-market with
changes reflected in income currently. Beginning January 1,
2003, the Corporation accounted for all trading inventory at the
lower of cost or market. This accounting change did not have a
material effect on the Corporation’s income or financial
position.

in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico properties.
Exploration and production results also reflected an additional
accrual of $15 million for vacated office lease costs.
Exploration and production earnings also included foreign income
tax adjustments of $19 million resulting from a tax law
change and a tax settlement.

     
Refining and marketing results include $20 million of
income from the liquidation of LIFO inventories. Corporate
expenses include $20 million of insurance costs related to
retrospective premium increases and a $13 million income
tax benefit arising from the settlement of a federal tax audit.

     
2003: The Corporation recorded a charge of
$58 million for premiums paid on the repurchase of bonds.
This charge is reflected in non-operating income
(expense) in the income statement.

     
Exploration and production results included expenses of
$53 million for accrued severance and vacated office costs.
Of this amount, $32 million relates to leased office space
and the remainder relates to severance for positions that were
eliminated in London, Aberdeen and Houston. The 2003 expense is
reflected principally in general and administrative expense in
the income statement. At December 31, 2003, the Corporation
had a related accrual of $38 million for severance and
vacated office costs. During 2004, the Corporation accrued
$17 million of additional costs and reduced the accrual by
$16 million for severance payments and lease costs. At
December 31, 2004, the accrual for severance and vacated
office space was $39 million.

     
Exploration and production earnings in 2003 included income tax
benefits of $30 million reflecting the recognition of
certain prior year foreign exploration expenses for United
States income tax purposes. In addition, the Corporation
recorded a gain of $47 million from the sale of its 1.5%
interest in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. A loss of
$9 million was recorded in refining and marketing earnings
due to the sale of a shipping joint venture.

     
2002: The Corporation recorded an impairment charge of
$706 million relating to the Ceiba field in Equatorial
Guinea. The charge resulted from a reduction in probable
reserves of approximately 12% of total field reserves, as well
as the additional development costs of producing these reserves
over a longer field life. Fair value was determined by
discounting anticipated future net cash flows. The Corporation
also recorded an impairment charge of $318 million to
reduce the carrying value of oil and gas properties located
primarily in the Main Pass/Breton Sound area of the Gulf of
Mexico. Most of these properties were obtained in the 2001 LLOG
acquisition and consisted of producing oil and gas fields with
proved and probable reserves and exploration acreage. This
charge principally reflects reduced reserve estimates on these
fields resulting from unfavorable production performance. The
fair values of producing properties were determined by using
discounted cash flows. Exploration properties were evaluated by
using results of drilling and production data from nearby fields
and seismic data for these and other properties in the area.
These charges were recorded in the caption asset impairments in
the income statement.

     
During 2002, the Corporation completed the sale of six United
States flag vessels in its refining and marketing segment for
$161 million in cash and a note for $29 million. The
sale resulted in a gain of $102 million. The Corporation
agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate for these
vessels for up to five years. A gain of $50 million was
deferred as part of the sale transaction to reflect potential
obligations of the support agreement. The support agreement
requires that, if the actual contracted rate for the charter of
a vessel is less than the stipulated charter rate in the
agreement, the Corporation pays to the buyer the difference
between the contracted rate and the stipulated rate. If the
actual contracted rate exceeds the stipulated rate, the buyer
must apply such amount to reimburse the Corporation for any
payments made by the Corporation up to that date. At
January 1, 2004, the charter support reserve was
$32 million. During 2004, the Corporation paid
$4 million of charter support. Based on contractual
long-term charter rates and estimates of future charter

51

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)


rates, the Corporation lowered the estimated charter support
reserve by $18 million. At December 31, 2004, the
remaining balance in the charter support reserve was
$10 million.

     
Gains of $41 million were recorded during 2002 from sales
of oil and gas producing properties in the United States, United
Kingdom and Azerbaijan and the Corporation’s energy
marketing business in the United Kingdom.

     
In 2002, the Corporation recorded a charge of $22 million
for the write-off of intangible assets in its U.S. energy
marketing business. In addition, accrued severance of
$13 million was recorded for cost reduction initiatives in
refining and marketing, principally in energy marketing.

     
The United Kingdom government enacted a 10% supplementary tax on
profits from oil and gas production in 2002. Because of this tax
law change, the Corporation recorded a one-time provision for
deferred taxes of $43 million to increase the deferred tax
liability on its balance sheet.








3.

Discontinued Operations


     
In 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude oil producing
properties in Colombia (acquired in 2001 as part of the Triton
acquisition), plus $10 million in cash, for an additional
25% interest in natural gas reserves in the joint development
area of Malaysia and Thailand. The exchange resulted in a charge
to income of $51 million before income taxes, which the
Corporation reported as a loss from discontinued operations. The
loss on this exchange included a $43 million adjustment of
the book value of the Colombian assets to fair value resulting
primarily from a revision in crude oil reserves. The loss also
included a $26 million charge from the recognition in
earnings of the value of related hedge contracts at the time of
the exchange. These items were partially offset by earnings of
$18 million in Colombia prior to the exchange. Income from
discontinued operations of $7 million in 2004 reflects the
settlement of a previously accrued contingency relating to the
exchanged Colombian assets.

     
In 2003, the Corporation sold producing properties in the Gulf
of Mexico shelf, the Jabung Field in Indonesia and several small
United Kingdom fields. The aggregate proceeds from these sales
were $445 million and the after-tax gain from disposition
was $176 million.

     
Sales and other operating revenues (net of intercompany sales)
from discontinued operations were $97 million in 2003 and
$381 million in 2002. Pretax operating profit for the same
periods was $82 million and $14 million, respectively.
Income tax expense (benefit) was $29 million and
$(13) million for the same periods. The net production from
fields accounted for as discontinued operations in 2003 at the
time of disposition was approximately 45,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day.

During 2004, the Corporation reduced LIFO inventories, which are
carried at lower costs than current inventory costs. The effect
of the LIFO inventory liquidation was to decrease cost of
products sold by approximately $20 million.

Before Virgin Islands income taxes, which were recorded by
    the Corporation.


    
During 2004, the Corporation received a cash distribution of
$88 million from HOVENSA. The Corporation’s share of
HOVENSA’s undistributed income at December 31, 2004
aggregated $398 million.

     
The Corporation has agreed to purchase 50% of
HOVENSA’s production of refined products at market prices,
after sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. Such purchases
amounted to approximately $2,940 million during 2004,
$2,040 million during 2003 and $1,280 million during
2002. The Corporation sold crude oil to HOVENSA for
approximately $35 million during 2004, $410 million
during 2003 and $80 million during 2002. In addition, the
Corporation billed HOVENSA freight charter costs of
$75 million during 2004, $59 million during 2003 and
$20 million during 2002.

     
The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of the value
of HOVENSA’s crude oil purchases from suppliers other than
PDVSA. At December 31, 2004, the guarantee amounted to
$97 million. This amount fluctuates based on the volume of
crude oil purchased and the related crude oil prices. In
addition, the

Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of
$40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to
meet its senior debt obligations.

     
At formation of the joint venture, PDVSA V.I., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of PDVSA, purchased a 50% interest in
the fixed assets of the Corporation’s Virgin Islands
refinery for $62.5 million in cash and a 10-year note from
PDVSA V.I. for $562.5 million bearing interest at
8.46% per annum and requiring principal payments over its
term. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the principal balance
of the note was $273 million and $334 million,
respectively.

During 2003, the Corporation recorded non-cash additions to
fixed assets of $1,340 million. Of this total,
$485 million related to assets that were previously
accounted for as an equity investment in a company that holds
natural gas reserves in Malaysia and Thailand. The remaining
$855 million resulted from asset exchanges. The Corporation
also recorded deferred income tax liabilities of
$105 million related to the asset exchanges. The assets and
liabilities relinquished in these exchanges included fixed
assets of approximately $770 million, an additional equity
investment of $145 million and deferred income tax
liabilities of $145 million.

The preceding table excludes exploratory dry hole costs of
$75 million, $121 million and $120 million in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, relating to wells that were
drilled and expensed in the same year. At December 31, 2004
and 2003, the capitalized costs relate to wells in process of
drilling and capitalized successful wells in the United States
Gulf of Mexico and planned developments in Equatorial Guinea,
Indonesia and Thailand. The Financial Accounting Standards Board
has issued a proposed FASB Staff Position (FSP) which would
further define the criteria for capitalizing exploration wells.
If this FSP is issued in final form, no material effect on the
Corporation’s results of operations or financial position
is anticipated.

In 2004, the Corporation entered into a new $2.5 billion
syndicated, revolving credit facility expiring in December 2009,
which can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At
December 31, 2004, the Corporation has used
$570 million of this facility for letters of credit.
Borrowings under the facility currently would bear interest at
..80% above the London Interbank Offered Rate. A facility fee of
..20% per annum is currently payable on the amount of the
credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to
adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes.

     
The Corporation’s long-term debt agreements contain
restrictions on the amount of total borrowings and cash
dividends allowed. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation is
permitted to borrow an additional $5.5 billion for the
construction or acquisition of assets. At year-end, the amount
that can be borrowed for the payment of dividends or stock
repurchases is $2.0 billion. Under the Corporation’s
revolving credit agreement, if two stated credit rating agencies
classify the Corporation’s public debt below investment
grade, an additional covenant becomes effective requiring that
the Corporation’s ratio of total consolidated debt to
consolidated EBITDA, as defined, shall not exceed 3.5. The
Corporation would have been in compliance with this covenant had
it been in effect for the year ended December 31, 2004.
This covenant shall be deleted from the credit agreement if both
credit rating agencies’ ratings are simultaneously
investment grade.

     
In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Corporation capitalized interest of
$54 million, $41 million and $101 million,
respectively, on major development projects. The total amount of
interest paid (net of amounts capitalized), principally on
short-term and long-term debt, in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was
$243 million, $313 million and $274 million,
respectively.








9.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans


     
The Corporation has outstanding restricted stock and stock
options under its Amended and Restated 1995 Long-Term Incentive
Plan. Generally, stock options vest from one to three years from
the date of grant and the exercise price equals or exceeds the
market price on the date of grant. Outstanding restricted common
stock generally vests three to five years from the date of grant.

The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the
fair value of employee stock options for pro forma disclosure of
the effects on net income and earnings per share. The
Corporation used the following weighted-average assumptions in
the Black-Scholes model for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively:
risk-free interest rates of 4.3%, 3.6% and 4.2%; expected stock
price volatility of .293, .288 and .262; dividend yield of 1.7%,
2.6% and 1.9%; and an expected life of seven years. The
weighted-average fair values per share of options granted for
which the exercise price equaled the market price on the date of
grant were $23.75 in 2004, $12.60 in 2003 and $19.63 in 2002.
The Corporation’s net income would have been reduced by
approximately $7 million in 2004, $1 million in 2003
and $14 million in 2002 if option expenses were recorded
using the fair value method.

     
Total compensation expense for restricted common stock was
$17 million in 2004, $11 million in 2003 and
$7 million in 2002. Awards of restricted common stock were

In 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board reissued
Statement No. 123, Share-Based Payment
(FAS 123R). This new standard requires that
compensation expense for all stock-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the
income statement based on fair values. Had the Corporation
adopted FAS 123R in prior periods, the impact would have
approximated the additional expenses disclosed above and in the
table under Stock-Based Compensation in Note 1. The
Corporation must adopt FAS 123R no later than July 1,
2005.

Foreign Currency Translation


     
Foreign currency gains (losses) from continuing operations
before income taxes amounted to $29 million in 2004,
$(6) million in 2003 and $26 million in 2002. The
balances in accumulated other comprehensive income related to
foreign currency translation were reductions in
stockholders’ equity of $58 million at
December 31, 2004 and $94 million at December 31,
2003.

Pension Plans


     
The Corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit
pension plans for substantially all of its employees. In
addition, the Corporation has an unfunded supplemental pension
plan covering certain employees. The unfunded supplemental
pension plan provides for incremental pension payments from the
Corporation’s funds so that total pension payments equal
amounts that would have been payable from the Corporation’s
principal pension plans, were it not for limitations imposed by
income tax regulations. The plans provide defined benefits based
on years of service and final average salary. The Corporation
uses December 31 as the measurement date for its plans.

Prior service costs and gains and losses in excess of 10% of the
greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets
are amortized over the average remaining service period of
active employees.

     
The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used by the
Corporation’s funded and unfunded pension plans were as

The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is based on
historical, long-term returns of the plan, adjusted to reflect
lower prevailing interest rates. Effective January 1, 2005,
the Corporation lowered the assumed long-term rate of return on
plan assets to 7.5%.

Asset allocations are rebalanced on a regular basis throughout
the year to bring assets to within a 2-3% range of target
levels. Target allocations take into account analyses performed

The Corporation has not recorded deferred income taxes
applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations. The Corporation had undistributed earnings from
foreign subsidiaries of approximately $4 billion at
December 31, 2004. On October 22, 2004, the President
signed the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) that effectively
provides for a one-time reduction of the income tax rate to
5.25% on eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a U.S.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)


parent. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the Corporation
decided to repatriate approximately $1.3 billion of
unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, the Corporation
expects to record a tax provision of approximately
$41 million in the first quarter of 2005. Had the
additional taxes been recorded at the end of 2004, net income
would have been $936 million ($9.93 per share basic and
$9.17 per share diluted). The Corporation is reviewing the
possibility of additional repatriations during 2005. The maximum
additional amount eligible for repatriation under the Act is
approximately $600 million. The Corporation estimates that
an additional tax provision of up to $32 million would be
recorded, depending on the incremental amount distributed, if
any. If the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, in excess of the
amounts eligible for repatriation under the Act were not
indefinitely reinvested, a deferred tax liability of
approximately $230 million would be required, assuming
utilization of available foreign tax credits.

     
For income tax reporting at December 31, 2004, the
Corporation has alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $128 million, which can be carried forward
indefinitely. The Corporation also has approximately
$40 million of general business credits. At
December 31, 2004, the Corporation has net operating loss
carryforwards in the United States of approximately
$1.9 billion, substantially all of which expire in 2022
through 2024. At December 31, 2004, a Virgin Islands net
operating loss carryforward of approximately $190 million,
which expires in 2017 through 2022, is also available to offset
the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA joint venture income and
to reduce taxes on interest income from the PDVSA note. In
addition, a foreign exploration and production subsidiary has a
net operating loss carryforward of approximately
$670 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely.

     
Income taxes paid (net of refunds) in 2004, 2003 and 2002
amounted to $632 million, $361 million and
$410 million, respectively.

In 2003, the Corporation issued 13,500,000 shares of 7%
cumulative mandatory convertible preferred stock. Dividends are
payable on March 1, June 1, September 1 and
December 1 of each year. The cumulative mandatory
convertible preferred shares have a liquidation preference of
$675 million ($50 per share). Each cumulative
mandatory convertible preferred share will automatically convert
on December 1, 2006 into .8305 to 1.0299 shares of
common stock, depending on the average closing price of the
Corporation’s common stock over a 20-day period before
conversion. The Corporation has reserved 13,903,650 shares
of common stock for the conversion of these preferred shares.
Holders of the cumulative mandatory convertible preferred stock
have the right to convert their shares at any time prior to
December 1, 2006 at the rate of .8305 share of common
stock for each preferred share converted. The cumulative
mandatory convertible preferred shares do not have voting
rights, except in certain limited circumstances.


14.     Leased Assets

     
The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline
stations, tankers, floating production systems, drilling rigs,
office space and other assets for varying periods. At
December 31, 2004, future minimum rental payments

Financial Instruments, Non-trading and Trading Activities


     
Non-Trading: FAS No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, requires
that the Corporation recognize all derivatives on the balance
sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for using
derivatives as hedges. The Corporation reclassifies hedging
gains and losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to
earnings at the time the hedged transactions are recognized.
Hedging decreased exploration and production results by
$935 million before income taxes in 2004 and
$418 million in 2003. Hedging increased exploration and
production results before income taxes by $82 million in
2002. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness reflected in income
was not material during the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002. The pre-tax amount of all deferred hedge losses
is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax
benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance
sheet.

     
The Corporation produced 90 million barrels of crude oil
and natural gas liquids and 210 million Mcf of natural gas
in 2004. The Corporation’s crude oil and natural gas
hedging activities included commodity futures and swap
contracts. At December 31, 2004, crude oil hedges maturing
in 2005 cover 52 million barrels of crude oil production
(93 million barrels of crude oil at December 31,
2003). The Corporation also has hedged approximately
9 million barrels per year of Brent related production from
2006 through 2012. The Corporation has no natural gas hedges at
December 31, 2004 (18 million Mcf of natural gas at
December 31, 2003). At December 31, 2004, net after
tax deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income
from the Corporation’s crude oil hedging contracts were
$875 million ($1,374 million before income taxes),
including $195 million of realized losses and
$680 million of unrealized losses. Realized losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income represent losses on
closed contracts that are deferred until the underlying barrels
are sold. Approximately $52 million of the realized loss
will reduce earnings in the first quarter of 2005 and the
remainder will reduce earnings during the balance of 2005. Of
the net after-tax deferred loss, $493 million matures
during 2005. At December 31, 2003, net after-tax deferred
losses were $229 million ($352 million before income
taxes), including $196 million of unrealized losses.

     
Commodity Trading: The Corporation, principally
through a consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities,
including futures, forwards, options, swaps and energy commodity
linked securities, based on expectations of future market
conditions. The Corporation’s income before income taxes
from trading activities, including its share of the earnings of
the trading partnership amounted to $72 million in 2004,
$30 million in 2003 and $6 million in 2002.

     
Other Financial Instruments: Foreign currency
contracts are used to protect the Corporation from fluctuations
in exchange rates. The Corporation enters into foreign currency
contracts, which are not designated as hedges, and the change in
fair value is included in income currently. The Corporation has
$476 million of notional value foreign currency forward
contracts maturing in 2005 ($384 million at
December 31, 2003). Notional amounts do not quantify risk
or represent assets or liabilities of the Corporation, but are
used in the calculation of cash settlements under the contracts.
The fair values of the

65

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)


foreign currency forward contracts recorded by the Corporation
were receivables of $49 million at December 31, 2004
and $40 million at December 31, 2003.

     
The Corporation also has $1,487 million in letters of
credit outstanding at December 31, 2004 ($229 million
at December 31, 2003). Of the total letters of credit
outstanding at December 31, 2004, $72 million relates
to contingent liabilities; the remaining $1,415 million
relates to liabilities recorded on the balance sheet.

     
Fair Value Disclosure: The Corporation estimates
the fair value of its fixed-rate notes receivable and debt
generally using discounted cash flow analysis based on current
interest rates for instruments with similar maturities. Foreign
currency exchange contracts are valued based on current
termination values or quoted market prices of comparable
contracts. The Corporation’s valuation of commodity
contracts considers quoted market prices where applicable. In
the absence of quoted market prices, the Corporation values
contracts at fair value considering time value, volatility of
the underlying commodities and other factors.

     
The following table presents the year-end fair values of energy
commodities and derivative financial instruments used in
non-trading and trading activities:

Credit Risks: The Corporation’s financial
instruments expose it to credit risks and may at times be
concentrated with certain counterparties or groups of
counterparties. The credit worthiness of counterparties is
subject to continuing review and full performance is
anticipated. The Corporation reduces its risk related to certain
counterparties by using master netting agreements and requiring
collateral, generally cash or letters of credit.

     
In its trading activities the Corporation has net receivables of
$380 million at December 31, 2004, which are
concentrated with counterparties as follows: domestic and
foreign trading companies — 52%, banks and major
financial institutions — 25%, gas and power
companies — 10% and integrated energy
companies — 6%.

16.

Guarantees and Contingencies


     
In the normal course of business, the Corporation provides
guarantees for investees of the Corporation. These guarantees
are contingent commitments that ensure performance for repayment
of borrowings and other arrangements. The Corporation’s
guarantees include $40 million of HOVENSA’s senior
debt obligation and $97 million of HOVENSA’s crude oil
purchases (see Note 5). The remainder relates principally
to loan guarantees, $55 million for a natural gas pipeline
in which the Corporation owns a 5% interest and $45 million
for an oil pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 2.36%
interest. The guarantee of the natural gas pipeline debt
declines over its term. The guarantee of the crude oil pipeline
will be in place through the end of pipeline construction, which
the Corporation expects to be in 2005. In addition, the
Corporation has $72 million in letters of credit for which
it is contingently liable. The maximum potential amount of
future payments that the Corporation could be required to make
under its guarantees at December 31, 2004 is
$309 million ($233 million at December 31, 2003).

     
The Corporation is also subject to contingent liabilities with
respect to existing or potential claims, lawsuits and other
proceedings. The Corporation considers these routine and
incidental to its business and not material to its financial
position or results of operations. The Corporation accrues
liabilities when the future costs are probable and reasonably
estimable.








17.

Segment Information


     
The Corporation has two operating segments that comprise the
structure used by senior management to make key operating
decisions and assess performance. These are (1) exploration
and production and (2) refining and marketing. Operating
segments have not been aggregated. Exploration and production
operations include the exploration for and the production,
purchase, transportation and sale of crude oil and natural gas.
Refining and marketing operations include the manufacture,
purchase, transportation, trading and marketing of petroleum and
other energy products.

SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DATA


(Unaudited)

     
The supplementary oil and gas data that follows is presented in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(FAS) No. 69, Disclosures about Oil and Gas
Producing Activities, and includes (1) costs incurred,
capitalized costs and results of operations relating to oil and
gas producing activities, (2) net proved oil and gas
reserves, and (3) a standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves,
including a reconciliation of changes therein.

     
The Corporation produces crude oil and/or natural gas in the
United States, Europe, Equatorial Guinea, Algeria, Gabon,
Indonesia, Thailand and Azerbaijan. Exploration activities are
also conducted, or are planned, in additional countries.

     
During 2004, the development plan for the Okume Complex was
approved by the government of Equatorial Guinea and most of the
major contracts for construction were authorized. Production is
expected to commence in 2007. Additional gas sales were
negotiated covering Block A-18 in the joint development area of
Malaysia and Thailand (JDA). First production from the JDA
commenced in 2005 under the original gas sales contract. During
2004, the Ujung Pangkah gas sales agreement was approved.

     
During 2003, the Corporation exchanged its interests in
producing oil and gas fields in the United Kingdom for an
increased interest in a Gulf of Mexico field. The Corporation
sold producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, the
Jabung Field in Indonesia and several small United Kingdom
fields. The Corporation also exchanged producing properties in
Colombia for an additional 25% interest in the JDA. Because of
this exchange, the Corporation has consolidated its oil and gas
interests in the JDA. In 2003, the Corporation also exchanged
its 25% equity investment in Premier Oil plc for an interest in
a producing field in Indonesia.

Results of Operations for Oil and Gas Producing Activities

     
The results of operations for oil and gas producing activities
shown below exclude non-operating income (including gains on
sales of oil and gas properties), interest expense and gains and
losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions. Therefore,
these results are on a different basis than the net income from
exploration and production operations reported in
management’s discussion and analysis of results of
operations and in Note 17 to the financial statements.

Oil and Gas Reserves

     
The Corporation’s oil and gas reserves are calculated in
accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the
requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For
reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially
producible; government approvals must be obtained and depending
on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the
board of directors must commit to fund the project. The
Corporation’s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting
process involves an annual independent third party reserve
determination as well as internal technical appraisals of
reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve
estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work
directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporation’s
technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year
based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new
technical data and other studies. To provide consistency
throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation
guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval
practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject
to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the
estimates.

     
The oil and gas reserve estimates reported below are determined
independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton
(D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually,
the Corporation provides D&M with engineering, geological
and geophysical data, actual production histories and other
information necessary for the reserve determination. The
Corporation’s and D&M’s technical staffs meet to
review and discuss the information provided. Senior management
and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates
issued by D&M.

(a)


Includes the impact of changes in selling prices on
    production sharing contracts with cost recovery provisions and
    stipulated rates of return. In 2004, revisions included
    reductions of approximately 23 million barrels of crude oil
    and 52 million Mcf of natural gas relating to higher
    selling prices. In 2003, such revisions were immaterial. In
    2002, revisions included reductions of approximately
    44 million barrels of crude oil and 26 million Mcf of
    natural gas relating to higher selling prices. In 2002,
    revisions also reflected reductions in reserves on fields
    acquired in the LLOG and Triton acquisitions.


 



(b)


Includes the reclassification of reserves to Africa, Asia and
    other from Equity Investees as a result of the consolidation of
    the Corporation’s interest in the JDA.


 



(c)


Includes additions and reductions to reserves from asset
    exchanges.


 



(d)


Includes 37% of crude oil reserves and 52% of natural gas
    reserves held under production sharing contracts. These reserves
    are located outside of the United States and are subject to
    different political and economic risks.


 



(e)


Excludes 438 million Mcf of carbon dioxide gas for sale
    or use in company operations.



Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

     
Future net cash flows are calculated by applying year-end oil
and gas selling prices (adjusted for price changes provided by
contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of
proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future development
and production costs, which are based on year-end costs and
existing economic assumptions. Future income tax expenses are
computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax
rates to the pre-tax net cash flows relating to the
Corporation’s proved oil and gas reserves. Future net cash
flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10%. The
discounted future net cash flow estimates required by
FAS No. 69 do not include exploration expenses,
interest expense or corporate general and administrative
expenses. The selling prices of crude oil and natural gas are
highly volatile. The year-end prices, which are required to be
used for the discounted future net cash flows and do not include
the effects of hedges, may not be representative of future
selling prices. The future net cash flow estimates could be
materially different if other assumptions were used.

Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31,
2004, John B. Hess, Chief Executive Officer, and John P. Rielly,
Chief Financial Officer, concluded that these disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,

meeting of stockholders to be held on May 4, 2005.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions


     
Information relating to this item is incorporated herein by
reference to “Election of Directors” from the
Registrant’s definitive proxy statement for the annual
meeting of stockholders to be held on May 4, 2005.












Item 14.

Principal Accounting Fees and Services


     
Information relating to this item is incorporated by reference
to “Ratification of Selection of Independent Auditors”
from the Registrant’s definitive proxy statement for the
annual meeting of stockholders to be held on May 4, 2005.

     
Ernst & Young LLP (EY), the Corporation’s
independent auditor, recently informed the Corporation and the
Corporation’s Audit Committee that certain non-audit work
has raised questions regarding EY’s independence. An
affiliate of EY in Indonesia held de minimis tax-related funds
and made payment of such

78



Table of Contents

funds to taxing authorities in connection with tax compliance
services provided by EY to certain expatriate employees of the
Corporation. The amount of funds handled by EY over the
three-year period was approximately $3,500. The services
provided by the EY affiliate have been discontinued. Custody of
the assets of an audit client is not permitted under the auditor
independence rules in Regulation S-X of the Securities
Exchange Commission.

     
The Corporation’s Audit Committee and EY have considered
the impact that these actions may have on EY’s independence
with respect to the Corporation and have concluded that there
has been no impairment of EY’s independence. In making this
determination, the Audit Committee considered the de minimis
amount of the funds involved and the ministerial nature of the
actions. In addition, the Corporation’s subsidiary involved
is not material to the Corporation’s consolidated financial
statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


Executive Committee and Members


HOVENSA L.L.C.

     
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of
HOVENSA L.L.C. (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of
income and retained earnings, cash flows and comprehensive
income (loss) for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

     
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of HOVENSA L.L.C. at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


(Thousands of Dollars)








Note 1:

Basis of Financial Statements and Significant Accounting
    Policies


     
Nature of Business: HOVENSA L.L.C. (Company) was
formed as a joint venture between Petroleos de
Venezuela, SA. (PDVSA) and Amerada Hess Corporation
(AHC) to own and operate the Company’s refinery. The
Company purchases crude oil from PDVSA, AHC and third parties.
It manufactures and sells petroleum products primarily to PDVSA
and AHC. In preparing financial statements, management makes
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and
expenses in the statement of income. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Estimates made by management include:
inventory and other asset valuations, environmental obligations,
depreciable lives and turnaround accruals.

     
The Company is jointly owned by PDVSA V.I., Inc.
(PDVSA V.I.), a subsidiary of PDVSA, and Hess Oil Virgin
Islands Corp. (HOVIC), a subsidiary of AHC.

     
A summary of all material transactions between the Company, its
members and affiliates follows:

The Company has a product sales agreement with AHC and Petroleum
Marketing International (Petromar), a subsidiary of PDVSA. After
any sales of refined products by HOVENSA to third parties,
Petromar and AHC each must purchase 50% of HOVENSA’s
gasoline, distillate, residual fuel and other products at market
prices. The Company also has long-term crude oil supply
agreements with Petromar, by which Petromar agrees to sell to
HOVENSA a monthly average of 155,000 barrels per day of
Mesa crude oil and 115,000 barrels per day of Merey crude
oil.

     
PDVSA and AHC each guarantee the payment of up to 50% of the
value of the crude oil purchases from third parties. In
addition, PDVSA and AHC have agreed to provide funding
(50% each) to the extent that the Company does not have
funds to meet its senior debt obligations up to
$40,000 each, until completion of construction required to
meet final low sulfur fuel regulations, after which the amount
becomes $15,000 each.

     
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents consist of
highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into
cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired.

     
Short Term Investments: Instruments with an original
maturity to the Company of over 90 days. At
December 31, 2004 this balance was $38,841. The Company
intends and has the ability to hold these investments to
maturity.

     
Debt Service Reserve Fund: Cash held by the Trustee for
debt service that is not available for general corporate
purposes.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)


(Thousands of Dollars)

     
Inventories: Inventories of crude oil and refined
products are valued at the lower of last-in, first-out
(LIFO) cost or market. During 2004 and 2003, a reduction of
inventory quantities in a LIFO pool resulted in a liquidation of
LIFO inventories carried at below market costs, which increased
net income by approximately $600 and $9,000, respectively. At
December 31, 2004, LIFO inventory cost was $331,967 lower
than it would have been using the average cost method.

     
Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at the lower of
average cost or market.

     
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenues from
the sale of petroleum products when title passes to the customer.

     
Depreciation: Depreciation of refinery facilities is
determined principally on the units-of-production method based
on estimated production volumes. Depreciation of all other
equipment is determined on the straight-line method based on
estimated useful lives.

     
Maintenance and Repairs: The estimated cost of major
maintenance (turnarounds) is accrued. Other expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged against income as
incurred. Renewals and improvements are treated as additions to
property, plant and equipment, and items replaced are treated as
retirements.

     
Environmental Policy: The Company capitalizes
environmental expenditures that increase the life of property or
that reduce or prevent environmental contamination. The Company
accrues environmental expenses resulting from existing
conditions that relate to past operations when the future costs
are probable and reasonably estimable.

     
Income Taxes: The Company is a limited liability company
and, as a result, income taxes are the responsibility of the
members.

     
Interest Hedges: In 2001, under the terms of its bank
credit agreement, the Company was required to use interest rate
collars to reduce the effects of fluctuations in interest
expense related to long-term debt. These derivatives were
designated as hedges of future cash flow (cash flow hedges) and
the gains or losses were recorded in other comprehensive income
until the related transactions were expensed in 2002. The
company’s obligation to maintain these hedges was completed
in 2002.

The Company retired the existing term loan facility and the
$150,000 general purpose revolver on November 12, 2004.
Another general purpose revolver was established on the same day
for $400,000, expiring in November 2008. This new facility
remained undrawn at December 31, 2004. Borrowings under
this agreement currently would bear interest at 2.5% above the
London Interbank Offered Rate. A facility fee of .625% per annum
is payable on the undrawn portion of the credit line. The
interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the
Company’s credit rating changes. The agreement is
collateralized by the physical assets and certain material
contracts of the Company.

     
In November 2002, the Company issued $126,753 of Senior Secured
Tax-Exempt Revenue Bonds under the authority of the Government
of the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Virgin Islands Public
Finance Authority. The principal payments on the Bonds commence
in 2014 and will be fully paid by July 1, 2021.

     
In December 2003, the Company issued $74,175 of Senior Secured
Tax-Exempt Revenue Bonds under the authority of the Virgin
Islands Public Finance Authority. The principal payments on the
Bonds commence in 2015 and will be fully paid by July 1,
2022. The proceeds from this issue were used to pre-pay
principal installments under the bank term loan facility.

     
In April 2004, the Company issued $50,660 of Senior Secured
Tax-Exempt Revenue Bonds under the authority of the Virgin
Islands Public Finance Authority. The principal payments on the
Bonds commence in

2015 and will be fully paid by July 1, 2022. The proceeds
from this issue were used to pre-pay principal installments
under the bank term loan facility.

     
The debt agreements contain various restrictions and conditions
with respect to incurrence of additional debt as well as cash
distributions. Cash distributions are restricted based on cash
flow coverage ratio covenants until such time as the Company
completes the construction required to meet final low sulfur
fuel regulations.

     
The Company capitalized interest of $2,958 in 2004 and $18,901
in 2002. The interest paid (net of amounts capitalized) was
$18,757 in 2004, $24,584 in 2003 and $8,619 in 2002.








Note 5:

Pension Plan


     
The Company has a noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan
for substantially all of its employees. The plan provides
defined benefits based on years of service and final average
salary. The Company uses December 31 as the measurement
date for its plan.

Prior service costs and gains and losses in excess of 10% of the
greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets
are amortized over the average remaining service period of
active employees.

The pension plan’s assumed long-term rate of return is
consistent with the long-term rate of return on plan assets of
Amerada Hess Corporation’s plan with a similar asset
allocation. The member’s long-term rate of return is based
on historical long-term returns, adjusted slightly to reflect
lower prevailing interest rates. Effective January 1, 2005,
the Company lowered the assumed long-term rate of return on plan
assets to 7.5%.

     
The Company’s pension plan assets by category are as
follows:

The target investment allocations for the plan assets are
55% equity securities and 45% debt securities. Asset
allocations are rebalanced on a regular basis throughout the
year to bring assets to within 2-3% range of target levels.
Target allocations take into account analyses performed by the
Company’s pension consultant to optimize long term risk/
return relationships. All assets are highly liquid and may be
readily adjusted to provide liquidity for current benefit
payment requirements.

     
The Company expects to contribute approximately $4,000 to its
pension plan in 2005.

Note 6:

Interest Hedges


     
The Company used interest rate collars to reduce the effects of
fluctuations in interest expense related to long-term debt. The
interest rate collars and the hedged transactions matured in
2002. These interest rate collars were designated as hedges of
expected future cash flows (cash flow hedges), and the losses
were recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged
interest was recognized. At December 31, 2001, deferred
losses from interest hedging were $6,955.

     
The Company reclassified hedging gains and losses on interest
rate collars from accumulated other comprehensive income to
interest expense (portions of which were capitalized) over the
period hedged. Hedging increased interest expense in 2002 by
$6,955. The ineffective portion of hedges was included in
earnings. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was not material.








Note 7:

Environmental Requirements


     
In December 1999, the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) adopted rules that phase in limitations on the
sulfur content of gasoline beginning in 2004. In December 2000,
the EPA adopted regulations to reduce substantially the
allowable sulfur content of diesel fuel by 2006. The EPA is also
considering restriction or a prohibition on the use of MTBE (New
York and Connecticut have banned it effective January 1,
2004), a gasoline additive that the Company produces and uses to
meet United States regulations requiring oxygenation of
reformulated gasoline.

     
The Company is reviewing options to determine the most cost
effective compliance strategies for these new fuel regulations.
The costs to comply will depend on a variety of factors,
including the availability of suitable technology and
contractors and whether the minimum oxygen content requirement
for reformulated gasoline remains in place if MTBE is banned.
Capital expenditures necessary to comply with the low sulfur
gasoline and diesel fuel requirements are estimated to be
$400,000 (including approximately $50,000 already spent).
Remaining capital expenditures are expected to be $350,000 over
the next two years.








Note 8:

Contingencies


     
The Company is party to litigation arising out of the normal
course of its business. In the opinion of management, all
matters are adequately covered by insurance or reserves or, if
not covered or reserved for, are not likely to have a material
adverse effect on the financial position of the Company.

            (e) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each bidding
Lender by telecopy whether or not its Competitive Bid has been accepted (and, if
so, the amount and Competitive Bid Rate so accepted), and each successful bidder
will thereupon become bound, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, to make
the Competitive Loan in respect of which its Competitive Bid has been accepted.

            (f) If the Administrative Agent shall elect to submit a Competitive
Bid in its capacity as a Lender, it shall submit such Competitive Bid directly
to the Company at least one quarter of an hour earlier than the time by which
the other Lenders are required to submit their Competitive Bids to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.

            SECTION 2.05. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, the Company, at its option, may request any
Issuing Bank or Issuing Banks to issue for the Company's account Letters of
Credit denominated in dollars, in form reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Banks, at any time and from time
to time during the Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency
between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions
of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the
Company to, or entered into by the Company with, any Issuing Bank relating to
any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
An Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit
if any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator
shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing
such Letter of Credit, or any law, rule, regulation or orders of any
Governmental Authority applicable to the Issuing Bank or any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request
that the Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally
or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank
with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital
requirement (for which the Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder)
not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank any
unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Effective
Date and which the Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it.



                                                                              22

            (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Company shall hand
deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements
for doing so have been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) to an Issuing
Bank and the Administrative Agent (at least one Business Day in advance of the
requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a Notice of LC
Request requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter
of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the
date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with
paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name
and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be
necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested
by the Issuing Bank, the Company also shall submit a letter of credit
application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request
for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or
extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each
Letter of Credit the Company shall be deemed to represent and warrant that),
after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the
aggregate LC Exposure shall not exceed the aggregate Commitments, (ii) the
portion of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by any
Issuing Bank shall not exceed the LC Commitment of such Issuing Bank (unless
otherwise agreed by such Issuing Bank) and (iii) the Total Exposures shall not
exceed the total Commitments. Each Issuing Bank shall promptly (and in any event
within one Business Day) notify the Administrative Agent of each issuance,
amendment, renewal, extension or expiry of, and of each drawing under, each
Letter of Credit issued by it, and shall provide to the Administrative Agent
such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as
to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Issuing Bank shall deliver a Notice of LC Activity to the
Administrative Agent and the Company within one Business Day of the issuance,
amendment, renewal, extension or expiry of, and of each drawing under, a Letter
of Credit. Such Notice of LC Activity shall include, to the extent applicable,
(i) a copy of the applicable Letter of Credit (or, if applicable, any amendment
thereof), (ii) information with respect to the stated amount, beneficiary and
expiration date of such Letter of Credit and (iii) information with respect to
the amendment, renewal, extension or expiry of, or drawing under, such Letter of
Credit.

            (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior
to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date
of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is thirty Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.

            (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, each Issuing Bank
hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing
Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable
Percentage of the aggregate amount available



                                                                              23

to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of
the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay
to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lender's
Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not
reimbursed by the Company on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this
Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Company
for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

            (e) Reimbursement. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement
in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Company shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, not later than the
next Business Day following the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the
Company shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 2:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, or, if such notice
has not been received by the Company prior to such time on such date, then not
later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day next following
the date on which the Company receives such notice by such time; provided that
the Company may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein,
request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with an
ABR Revolving Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed,
the Company's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced
by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing. If the Company fails to make such
payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the
applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Company in respect
thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following
receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its
Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Company, in the same
manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender
(and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of
the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable
Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following
receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Company pursuant to
this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the
applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments
pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders
and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a
Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse any Issuing Bank for any LC
Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans as contemplated
above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Company of its
obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

            (f) Obligations Absolute. The Company's obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the



                                                                              24

terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or
other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Company's obligations hereunder. None of
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, or any of their
Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Banks; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any
Issuing Bank from liability to the Company to the extent of any direct damages
(as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
waived by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the
Company that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of an
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

            (g) Disbursement Procedures. Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Each Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Company by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to
reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

            (h) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Company shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day



                                                                              25

from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the
date that the Company reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum
then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that, if the Company fails to
reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
Section, then Section 2.12(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this
paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that
interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the
account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

            (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. Any Issuing Bank may be
replaced at any time by written agreement among the Company, the Administrative
Agent and the successor Issuing Bank, and consented to by the replaced Issuing
Bank (such agreements and consent not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld).
The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an
Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the
Company shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of
any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights
and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect
to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the
term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any
previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as
the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder,
the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have
all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with
respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall
not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

            (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and
be continuing, on the Business Day that the Company receives notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposures representing greater
than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral
pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall deposit in an account with the
Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the
benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such
date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation
to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such
deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice
of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the
Company described in clause (g) or (h) of Article VII. Each such deposit shall
be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and
performance of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the
exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned
on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the
option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Company's risk
and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any,
on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account
shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse any Issuing Bank for
LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied,



                                                                              26

shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the
Company for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has
been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC
Exposures representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to
satisfy other obligations of the Company under this Agreement. If the Company is
required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the
occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three Business Days after all
Events of Default have been cured or waived.

            (k) Designation of Additional Issuing Banks. From time to time, the
Company may by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders designate as
additional Issuing Banks one or more Lenders that agree to serve in such
capacity as provided below. The acceptance by a Lender of any appointment as an
Issuing Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement (an "Issuing Bank
Agreement"), which shall be in a form satisfactory to the Company and the
Administrative Agent, shall set forth the LC Commitment of such Lender and shall
be executed by such Lender, the Company and the Administrative Agent and, from
and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender shall have all
the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents and (ii) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the
term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as an
Issuing Bank.

            (l) Existing Letters of Credit. As of the Effective Date, each
Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Agreement,
to be a Letter of Credit issued under this Section.

            SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each
Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account of the Administrative Agent most
recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; such
transfers shall be made by (x) 12:00 Noon, New York City time in the case of
Borrowings other than ABR Borrowings and (y) 2:00 p.m., New York City time in
the case of ABR Borrowings on the date such Loan is made. The Administrative
Agent will make such amounts available to the Company by promptly crediting the
amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Company designated by
the Company in the applicable Borrowing Request or Competitive Bid Request;
provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to refinance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.

            (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
a Lender prior to the proposed time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Company severally agree to



                                                                              27

pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount
with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
made available to the Company to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds
Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of the Company, the interest rate applicable
to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then
such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing
initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request
and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial
Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Company
may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such
Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, may elect
Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Company may
elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected
Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the
Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising
each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall
not apply to Competitive Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.

            (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Company shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Company were
requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be
made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Company.

            (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

            (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies
      and, if different options are being elected with respect to different
      portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting
      Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to
      clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting
      Borrowing);

            (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
      Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

            (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
      Eurodollar Borrowing; and

            (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
      Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
      election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
      term "Interest Period".



                                                                              28

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Company shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

            (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

            (e) If the Company fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent,
at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long
as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may
be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid,
each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at
the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

            SECTION 2.08. Termination of Commitments; Reduction of Commitments.
(a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments and the LC Commitments shall
terminate on the Maturity Date.

            (b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time
reduce, the aggregate amount of the Commitments; provided that (i) each
reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple
of $10,000,000 and not less than $50,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not
terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent
prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the sum of the Total
Exposures of all the Lenders would exceed the total Commitments.

            (c) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this
Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of
termination of the Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such
notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in
which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments
shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably
among the Lenders based on their respective Commitments.

            SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The
Company hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each
Revolving Loan made



                                                                              29

to the Company on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Loan
made by such Lender to the Company on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable to such Loan.

            (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Company to such Lender
resulting from each Loan made by such Lender to the Company, including the
amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender by the Company
from time to time hereunder.

            (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it
shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type
thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Company to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's
share thereof.

            (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall, absent manifest error, be prima
facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain
such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation
of the Company to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

            (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note. In such event, the Company shall prepare, execute and deliver
to such Lender a nonnegotiable promissory note substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit B (a "Note") payable to the order of such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its permitted registered assigns).
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all
times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by
one or more Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such
Note is a registered Note, to such payee and its permitted registered assigns).

            SECTION 2.10. Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Company shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing made by it in
whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of
this Section; provided that the Company shall not have the right to prepay any
Competitive Loan without the prior consent of the Lender thereof.

            (b) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment and (ii) in
the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such
notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the
principal amount of each Borrowing or portion



                                                                              30

thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in
connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as
contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if
such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly
following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each
partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would
be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type
as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be
applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments
shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12.

            SECTION 2.11. Fees. (a) The Company agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee, (the
"Facility Fee") which shall accrue at the Applicable Facility Fee Rate on the
daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether used or unused) during
the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which
such Commitment terminates; provided that, if such Lender continues to have any
Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then such Facility
Fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lender's Revolving
Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates
to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Revolving
Credit Exposure. Accrued Facility Fees shall be payable in arrears on the last
day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which
the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the
date hereof; provided that any Facility Fees accruing after the date on which
the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All Facility Fees shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual
number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

            (b) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (i) for
the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit (an "LC Participation Fee"), which shall
accrue at the Applicable Margin used to determine interest on Eurodollar
Revolving Loans on the daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any
portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period
from and including the date hereof but excluding the later of the date on which
such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to
have any LC Exposure, and (ii) for the account of each Issuing Bank a fronting
fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily
amount of the LC Exposure attributable to the Letters of Credit issued by such
Issuing Bank (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC
Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date
on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Bank's
standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of
any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees
and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June,
September and December of each year shall be payable on the 15th day of the
month following such last day (or, if such 15th day is not a Business day, on
the next succeeding Business Day), commencing on the first such date to occur



                                                                              31

after the date hereof; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date
on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on
which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees
payable to an Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10
days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on
the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of
days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

            (c) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and each
of the Lenders, for their own accounts, fees payable in the amounts and at the
times separately agreed upon between the Company and such other parties.

            (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Lenders, in
the case of fees payable to them) for distribution, in the case of Facility
Fees, to the Lenders. Absent manifest error, fees paid shall not be refundable
under any circumstances.

            (e) Within 10 days after the end of each fiscal quarter (commencing
with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2004), the Company shall deliver to
the Administrative Agent a schedule (i) stating the aggregate amount of
participation fees due and payable with respect to such fiscal quarter and (ii)
stating the aggregate amount of fronting fees due and payable to each Issuing
Bank with respect to such fiscal quarter. Promptly after receipt of each such
schedule, (x) the Administrative Agent shall compare such amounts with its own
calculations of the participation and fronting fees due and payable with respect
to such fiscal quarter and (y) the Administrative Agent and the Company shall
discuss the amounts set forth in each such schedule and shall, subject to the
next sentence, agree on the amount of such fees to be paid by the Company for
such fiscal quarter. Neither the failure of the Company to deliver any such
schedule, nor the inaccuracy of any such schedule, shall relieve the Company of
its obligations to pay such fees hereunder, but no such failure or inaccuracy
shall constitute a Default or an Event of Default. In the event the Company pays
any such fees based on any such schedule or any such agreement by the
Administrative Agent and the amount so paid by the Company is insufficient to
satisfy the Company's actual payment obligations under Section 2.11(a) and (b)
above, then the Company shall remain liable for any such deficiency and the
Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent (for its account, the account of
the applicable Issuing Banks and/or the account of the Lenders, as applicable)
the amount of any such deficiency within two Business Days of demand thereof.

            SECTION 2.12. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing
shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus
the Applicable Margin.

            (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving
Loan, the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) in the case of a Eurodollar
Competitive Loan, the LIBO Rate for the



                                                                              32

Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus (or minus, as applicable) the
Margin applicable to such Loan.

            (c) Each Fixed Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the Fixed Rate applicable to such Loan.

            (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest
on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Company hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of
any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided above.

            (e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date for such Loan; provided that (i) interest accrued
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in
the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of
an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued
interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date
of such repayment or prepayment, (iii) in the event of any conversion of any
Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period
therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date
of such conversion and (iv) all accrued interest shall be payable upon
termination of the Commitments.

            (f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base
Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and
shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day
but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO
Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            SECTION 2.13. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

            (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall
      be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
      not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as
      applicable, for such Interest Period; or

            (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (or,
      in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Loan, the Lender that is required
      to make such Loan) that because of a change in circumstances affecting the
      eurodollar market generally the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as
      applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly
      reflect the cost to such Lenders



                                                                              33

      (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in
      such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be
ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving
Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing and (iii) any
request by the Company for a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing shall be
ineffective; provided that (A) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice
do not affect all the Lenders, then requests by the Company for Eurodollar
Competitive Borrowings may be made to Lenders that are not affected thereby and
(B) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of
Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.

            SECTION 2.14. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

            (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit
      or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account
      of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
      reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or

            (ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London
      interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
      Eurodollar Loans or Fixed Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of
      Credit or participations therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan (or of
maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost of
such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any
Letter of Credit or reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such
Lender or such Issuing bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise), then the Company will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank
for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

            (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such
Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of
this Agreement or the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, to a
level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such
Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law
(taking into consideration such Lender's or Issuing Bank's policies and the
policies of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to
capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender or
such Issuing Bank such additional amount or amounts as will



                                                                              34

compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's
holding company for any such reduction suffered.

            (c) A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or
its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank the
amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt
thereof.

            (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank
to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; provided
that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank
pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more
than three months prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank
notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
reductions and of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's intention to claim
compensation therefor; provided, further that, if the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the three-month
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive
effect thereof.

            (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, a
Lender shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section in respect
of any Competitive Loan if the Change in Law that would otherwise entitle it to
such compensation shall have been publicly announced prior to submission of the
Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Loan was made.

            SECTION 2.15. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the
payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on
the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of
an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on
the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to
borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in
any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is
permitted to be revocable under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance
herewith), (d) the failure to borrow any Competitive Loan after accepting the
Competitive Bid to make such Loan, or (e) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan
or Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.18, then,
in any such event, the Company shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost
and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, the
loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an
amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the
principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment,
conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest
Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or
continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such



                                                                              35

borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such
deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period, over (ii)
the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for
such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period
at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such
Lender) for dollar deposits from other banks in the eurodollar market at the
commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any
such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

            SECTION 2.16. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of
any obligation of the Company hereunder shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the
Company shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or
Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Company shall make such
deductions and (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

            (b) In addition, the Company shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

            (c) The Company shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each
Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for
the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable
under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted
by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such
payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or
by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an
Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Company to a Governmental Authority, the Company shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

            (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Company is located, or



                                                                              36

any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under
this Agreement shall, upon request of the Company, deliver to the Company (with
a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by
applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company, such properly completed
and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

            SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs. (a) The Company shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees, reimbursement of LC
Disbursements or of any amounts under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise)
prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the date when due in immediately
available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after
such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be
deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of
calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the
Administrative Agent at its offices at 1111 Fannin, 10th Floor, Houston, Texas
77002, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall
be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall
distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person
to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment
hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any
payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of
such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.

            (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available
to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed
LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be
applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among
the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees
then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC
Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then
due to such parties.

            (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in unreimbursed LC
Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion
of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans or participations in unreimbursed
LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by
any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall
purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans or
participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent
necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans or participations in
unreimbursed LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are
purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be



                                                                              37

rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery,
without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be
construed to apply to any payment made by the Company pursuant to and in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a
Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any
of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph
shall apply). The Company consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it
may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Company rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Company in the amount of
such participation.

            (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder that the
Company will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the
Company has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank
the amount due. In such event, if the Company has not in fact made such payment,
then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of
payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

            (e) If any Lender or Issuing Bank shall fail to make any payment
required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or
2.17(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding
any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender or such Issuing Bank to
satisfy such Lender or such Issuing Bank's obligations under such Sections until
all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

            SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Company is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the
future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.



                                                                              38

            (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if
the Company is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement
(other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it) to an assignee that
shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender
accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Company shall have received the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Revolving Commitment
is being assigned, each Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be
withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the
outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and
participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and
all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of
such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the
case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment
resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required
to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction
in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any
such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by
such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require
such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

            The Company represents and warrants to each of the Lenders and
Issuing Banks as follows:

            SECTION 3.01. Corporate Existence and Power; Compliance with Law.
The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. The Company is in
compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority
applicable to it or its property and all indentures, agreements and other
instruments binding upon it or its property, except where the failure to do so,
individually or in the aggregate, does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 3.02. Corporate Authority. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and each Note executed by the
Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and are
within the Company's corporate power, do not require the approval of the
shareholders of the Company, and will not violate any provision of law or of its
certificate of incorporation or other constitutive document or by-laws, or
result in the breach of or constitute a default



                                                                              39

or require any consent under, or result in the creation of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company pursuant to, any

      covenant contained in Section 5.07, 6.01, 6.02, 6.03, 6.04, 6.05 or 6.06
      for five consecutive days after such default shall have become known to

      in this Agreement for 30 consecutive days after such default shall have
      become known to the Company;

            (e) any obligation of the Company in respect of any Material
      Indebtedness now or hereafter outstanding shall become due by its terms
      whether by acceleration or otherwise and shall not be paid, extended or
      refunded or any default or event of default shall occur in respect of any
      such obligation and shall continue for a period of time sufficient to
      cause or permit the acceleration of maturity thereof, or the Company shall
      fail to pay any Swap Payment Obligation of the Company in excess of
      $10,000,000 when due and payable (whether by acceleration or otherwise),
      unless the Company is contesting such Swap Payment Obligation in good
      faith by appropriate proceedings and has set aside appropriate reserves
      relating thereto in accordance with GAAP; provided that in the case of any
      guaranties, endorsements and other contingent obligations in respect of
      any such obligation for borrowed money of an entity other than the Company
      (all of the foregoing being herein called "Accommodation Guaranty
      Indebtedness"), a default with respect to any evidence of Accommodation
      Guaranty Indebtedness of the Company or under any agreement under which
      any such evidence of Accommodation Guaranty Indebtedness may be
      outstanding shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder only if there
      shall have been a default in the performance by the Company of its
      obligations with respect to such Accommodation Guaranty Indebtedness and
      such default shall continue for more than 30 days after a holder or

      or other action is being contested by such Company or any of its
      Significant Subsidiaries in good faith, the same shall continue
      undismissed, or unstayed and in effect, for any period of 60 consecutive
      days; or

            (i) at any time subsequent to December 31, 2003 and prior to the
      Maturity Date, Continuing Directors shall fail to constitute at least a
      majority of the Board of Directors of the Company; for the foregoing
      purpose, the term "Continuing Directors" means those persons who were
      directors of the Company on December 31, 2003 and any person whose
      election or nomination for election as a director of the Company at any
      time subsequent thereto was approved by at least a majority of the persons
      who were then Continuing Directors;

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to the Company
described in clause (g) or (h) of this Article), and at any time thereafter
during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent shall, at the
request of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Company, take either or both
of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the
Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii)
declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part,
in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter
be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so
declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all
fees and other obligations of the Company hereunder, shall become due and
payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Company; and in case of any event
with respect to the



                                                                              50

Company described in clause (g) or (h) of this Article, the Commitments shall
automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding,
together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            The Administrative Agent

            Each of the Lenders and each of the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably
appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

            The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have
the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender or Issuing Bank as any
other Lender or Issuing Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries thereof or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the
Administrative Agent hereunder.

            The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or
other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is
continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary
rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is
required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders, and (c) except as
expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to
disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or
obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in
any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken
or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or
all the Lenders to the extent required by Section 9.02 or in the absence of its
own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be
deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice
thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company or a Lender, and the
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain
or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or
other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or
conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or
genuineness of this Agreement or



                                                                              51

any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm
receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

            The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall
not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate,
consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative
Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and
believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any
liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal
counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other
experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or
experts.

            The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more subagents appointed
by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such subagent may
perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their
respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding
paragraphs shall apply to any such subagent and to the Related Parties of the
Administrative Agent and any such subagent, and shall apply to their respective
activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided
for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

            Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Company, to appoint one of the Lenders a successor. If no
such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall
have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative
Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent
may, on behalf of the Lenders and in consultation with the Company, appoint one
of the Lenders as a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an
office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor,
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Company and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

            Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any other Lender and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will,



                                                                              52

independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Issuing
Bank or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall
from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking
or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement
or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

            The Co-Syndication Agents and the Co-Documentation Agents shall not
have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in their capacities as such.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  Miscellaneous

            SECTION 9.01. Notices. Except in the case of notices and other
communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and
other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be
delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or
registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows:

            (a) if to the Company, to Amerada Hess Corporation, 1185 Avenue of
      the Americas, New York, New York 10036, Attention of Treasurer (Telecopy
      No. (212) 536-8617);

            (b) if to the Administrative Agent, to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
      Loan & Agency Services, 1111 Fannin, 10th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002,
      Attention of Claudette Reid (Fax No. (713) 427-6307);

            (c) if to any other Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy
      number) set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire; and

            (d) if to an Issuing Bank, to it at the address specified in
      paragraph (c) above or, if such Issuing Banks shall not also be a Lender,
      to it at the address most recently specified by it in a notice delivered
      to the Administrative Agent and the Company.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and
other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.

            SECTION 9.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or
power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks



                                                                              53

and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or consent to any departure by the Company therefrom shall in any
event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by this Section, and then
such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default,
regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender
may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

            (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Company and the Required Lenders or by the Company and the
Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no
such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the
written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or
LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees
payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender and Issuing Bank
affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal
amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees or
any other amount payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any
such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section
2.17(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments
required thereby without the written consent of each Lender, or (v) change any
of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any
other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required
to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or
grant any consent hereunder without the written consent of each Lender; provided
further that (A) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the
rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent and (B) no amendment, modification or waiver
of this Agreement or any provision hereof that would alter the rights or duties
of any Issuing Bank hereunder shall be effective without the written consent of
such Issuing Bank.

            SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Company
agrees to pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges
and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with
the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation
and administration of this Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers
of the provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be consummated) and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, any
Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of
its rights in connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this
Section, or in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including in connection
with any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof.



                                                                              54

            (b) The Company agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, each
Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing
Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by
the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation
of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan
or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal
by an Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the
documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with
the terms of such Letter of Credit, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or
release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in
any way to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee or
its Affiliates or from a breach of this Agreement by such Indemnitee.

            (c) To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required
to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank under paragraph
(a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lender's
Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank in its capacity as such.

            (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall not
assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

            (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly
after written demand therefor.

            SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
Affiliate of an Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that the
Company may not assign or



                                                                              55

otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the
Company without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than
the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby
and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, Participants and the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

            (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements at the
time owing to it); provided that (i) each of the Company (except that (A) in the
case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or (B) upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the consent of the
Company shall not be required), the Administrative Agent and in the case of any
assignment of a Commitment, each Issuing Bank must give their prior written
consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
(ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender
or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's
Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each
such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not
be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Company and the Administrative Agent
otherwise consent, (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment
of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement, except that this clause (iii) shall not apply to rights in
respect of outstanding Competitive Loans, (iv) the parties to each assignment
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
Acceptance, together (except in the case of an assignment by a Lender to one of
its Affiliates or an assignment as a result of any of the events contemplated by
Section 2.18) with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and (v) the
assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
an Administrative Questionnaire. Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to
paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in
each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the
assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender
shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
paragraph (e) of this Section.

            (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Company, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a copy
of each



                                                                              56

Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, and the Company, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and
the Issuing Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Company, any Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

            (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

            (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of any of the Company, the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Banks, sell participations to one or more
banks or other entities (each a "Participant") in all or a portion of such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (iii) the Company, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to
Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this
Section, the Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of
this Section.

            (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participations sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participations to such Participant is made with the
Company's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if
it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless
the Company is notified of the participations sold to such



                                                                              57

Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to
comply with Section 2.16(e) as though it were a Lender.

            (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations
of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve
Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a
security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security
interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

            SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations
and warranties made by the Company herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any
Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its
behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have
had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty
at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force
and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or
any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and
unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The
provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall survive and remain in
full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination
of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

            SECTION 9.06. USA Patriot Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the
Company that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act, it is required
to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Company, which
information includes the name and address of the Company and other information
that will allow such Lender to identify the Company in accordance with its
requirements.

            SECTION 9.07. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and
any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the
Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating
to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except
as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall
have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent
shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.



                                                                              58

            SECTION 9.08. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

            SECTION 9.09. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final)
at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or
for the credit or the account of the Company against any of and all the
obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held
by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any
demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The
rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and
remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

            SECTION 9.10. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process; Process Agent; Waiver of Immunity. (a) This Agreement shall be
construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.

            (b) The Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States
District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New
York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall
affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender or Issuing Bank may
otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
against the Company or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

            (c) The Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to
in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

            (d) The Company and each other party to this Agreement irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices to it in
Section 9.01.



                                                                              59

Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement
to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

            SECTION 9.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

            SECTION 9.12. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table
of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of
this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

            SECTION 9.13. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders and the Issuing Banks agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to
its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including

the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder,
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any
prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its
advisors) to any securitization, swap or derivatives transaction relating to the
Company, any Subsidiaries and the obligations hereunder, (g) with the consent of
the Company or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available
other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to
the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank on a nonconfidential
basis from a source other than the Company. For the purposes of this Section,
"Information" means all information received from the Company relating to the
Company or its business, other than any such information that is available to
the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank on a nonconfidential
basis prior to disclosure by the Company; provided that, in the case of
information received from the Company after the date hereof, such information is
clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required

Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of
care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would

investigations of law as I have deemed appropriate as a basis for such opinions.

            In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have (a) relied as to
certain matters of fact on certificates of the officers of the Company, (b)
assumed, with your permission, without independent investigation or inquiry, (i)
the authenticity of all documents submitted as originals, (ii) the genuineness
of all signatures on all documents that I have examined (other than those of the
Company and officers of the Company) and (iii) the conformity to authentic
originals of documents submitted as certified, conformed or photostatic copies.

            When the opinions expressed below are stated "to the best of my
knowledge," I have made reasonable and diligent investigation of the subject
matters of such opinions and have no reason to believe that there exist any
facts or other information that would render such opinions incomplete or
incorrect.

            Based upon and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

            1.    The Company is duly incorporated and is validly existing as a
corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
corporation.

            2.    The Company has the corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to conduct the business in which it is
currently engaged and is duly qualified to transact business as a foreign
corporation or other legal entity and is in good standing or appropriately
qualified in each jurisdiction where its ownership, leasing, or operation of
property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except to
the extent that the failure to have such power and authority and the failure to
be so qualified and in good standing does not, in the aggregate, constitute a
Material Adverse Effect.

            3.    The Company has the corporate power and authority to make,
deliver and perform its obligations under each Transaction Document and to
borrow under the Credit Agreement. The Company has taken all necessary corporate
action to authorize the borrowings on the terms and conditions of the Credit
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of the Credit Agreement and each other Transaction
Document. No consent or authorization of, notice to, filing with or other act by
or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in
connection with (i) the borrowings by the Company under the Credit Agreement or
(ii) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company, or the validity or
enforceability against the Company, of each Transaction Document.

            4.    Each Transaction Document has been duly executed and delivered
on behalf of the Company. Each Transaction Document constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms.

            5.    The execution and delivery of each Transaction Document by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, the compliance by the
Company with any of the

                                       2

provisions thereof, the borrowings by the Company under the Credit Agreement and
the use of proceeds thereof, all as provided therein, (a) will not violate (i)
any requirement of law or any regulation or order of any Governmental Authority
applicable to the Company or (ii) any Contractual Obligation of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and (b) will not result in, or require, the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any of its or their respective assets or properties
pursuant to any such requirement of law (or regulation or order) or Contractual
Obligation.

            6.    No litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the best of my knowledge,
threatened by or against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or against any
of its or their respective properties or revenues (a) with respect to the Credit
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or (b) which would
constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

            7.    To the best of my knowledge, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is in default under or with respect to any Contractual
Obligations in any respect which would constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

            8.    The Company is not an "investment company" or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Company is not subject to regulation under
any Federal or state statute or regulation which limits its ability to incur
Indebtedness.

            9.    The use of proceeds of the Loans, as limited by the provisions
of the Credit Agreement, does not violate Regulations T, U and X of the Board as
in effect from time to time.

            The opinions set forth in the second sentence of paragraph 4 above
are subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, concepts of
materiality and reasonableness and an implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing.

            I am a member of the bar of the State of New York and the opinions
expressed herein are based upon and are limited to the laws of such state, the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal laws of the
United States of America.

                                       3

            This opinion has been rendered solely for your benefit and for the
benefit of your permitted assignees pursuant to Section 9.04 of the Credit
Agreement in connection with the Credit Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby and may not be used,
circulated, quoted, relied upon or otherwise referred to for any other purpose
without my prior written consent; provided, however, that this opinion may be
delivered to your regulators, accountants, attorneys and other professional
advisers and may be used in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding
relating to the subject matter of this opinion.

                                        Very truly yours,

JBC/jaa

each. Either party may terminate this agreement at any time by providing ninety
days advance written notice of termination to the other party. In the event of
termination, Ayco will be compensated for services rendered to date of
termination, however, in the event of termination of the Comprehensive and/or
Executive Counseling Program during the executive's first year of service, the

right to adjust our fees for executives with unusually complex financial or tax

adjustment of fees.

less.

The Ayco Company, L.P. is an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co., and a subsidiary

Company, L.P. receives a fee for financial counseling services. In the course of
providing such services, The Ayco Company, L.P., or its subsidiaries may offer
additional services and/or products for which additional fees or commissions are
charged. These offerings may create a conflict of interest between our corporate
interests and our responsibility to our clients. The Ayco Company, L.P. places
great emphasis on the integrity of its responsibility to clients. Executives
will be advised whenever fees or commissions paid to The Ayco Company, L.P. for
supplemental products or services constitute a conflict of interest. Executives

the specific conflict disclosed in compliance with the legal requirements for
obtaining such acknowledgements.

In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires us to provide
Amerada Hess Corporation with the enclosed copy of Form ADV-Part II, which
contains information relating to The Ayco Company, L.P.'s advisory services. The
Ayco Company, L.P. does not provide legal advice to executives. The services
provided by Ayco hereunder are not intended to and shall not result in Ayco
becoming a "fiduciary" under Section 3(21) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") with respect to any "employee benefit
plan" under Section 3(3) of ERISA or "plan" under Section 4975(e)(1) of the

this agreement, reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the prevailing
party shall be paid by the other party. Nothing in this agreement is intended
to, nor shall be construed to, confer upon or to give to any person, or entity,

      SECTION 3. ADMINISTRATION.

following actions, in each case subject to and consistent with the provisions of
the Plan:

      (i) to select and designate Participants;

      (ii) to designate Subsidiaries;

                                       2



      (iii) to determine the type or types of Awards to be granted to each
Participant;

      (iv) to determine the number of Awards to be granted, the number of Shares
to which an Award will relate, the terms and conditions of any Award granted
under the Plan (including, but not limited to, any exercise price, grant price,
or purchase price, any restriction or condition, any schedule for lapse of
restrictions or conditions relating to transferability or forfeiture,
exercisability, or settlement of an Award, and waivers or accelerations thereof,
and waiver of performance conditions relating to an Award, based in each case on
such considerations as the Committee shall determine), and all other matters to
be determined in connection with an Award;

      (v) to determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances an
Award may be settled, or the exercise price of an Award may be paid, in cash,
Shares, other Awards, or other property, or an Award may be cancelled,
forfeited, or surrendered;

      (vi) to determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances
cash, Shares, other Awards, or other property payable with respect to an Award
will be deferred either automatically, at the election of the Committee, or
pursuant to an agreement between the Corporation and the Participant;

      (vii) to prescribe the form of each Award Agreement, which need not be
identical for each Participant;

      (viii) to adopt, amend, suspend, waive, and rescind such rules and
regulations and appoint such agents as the Committee may deem necessary or
advisable to administer the Plan;

      (ix) to correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any
inconsistency in the Plan and to construe and interpret the Plan and any Award,
rules and regulations, Award Agreement, or other instrument hereunder; and

      (x) to make all other decisions and determinations as may be required
under the terms of the Plan or as the Committee may deem necessary or advisable
for the administration of the Plan.

      3.02 Manner of Exercise of Committee Authority. Unless authority is
specifically reserved to the Board under the terms of the Plan, or applicable
law, the Committee shall have sole discretion in exercising such authority under
the Plan. Any action of the Committee with respect to the Plan shall be final,
conclusive, and binding on all persons, including the Corporation, Subsidiaries,
Participants, any person claiming any rights under the Plan from or through any
Participant, and shareholders. The express grant of any specific power to the
Committee, and the taking of any action by the Committee, shall not be construed
as limiting any power or authority of the Committee. The Committee may delegate
to officers or managers of the Corporation or any Subsidiary the authority,
subject to such terms as the Committee shall determine, to perform
administrative functions under the Plan.

      3.03 Limitation of Liability. Each member of the Committee shall be
entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information
furnished to him by any officer or other employee of the Corporation or any
Subsidiary, the Corporation's independent certified public accountants, or any
executive compensation consultant or other professional retained by the
Corporation to assist in the administration of the Plan. No member of the
Committee, nor any officer or employee of the Corporation acting on behalf of
the Committee, shall be personally liable for any action, determination, or
interpretation taken or made in good faith with respect to the Plan, and all
members of the Committee and any officer or employee of the Corporation acting
on their behalf, shall, to the extent permitted by law, be fully indemnified and
protected by the Corporation with respect to any such action, determination, or
interpretation.

      SECTION 4. SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN. Subject to adjustment as provided
in Section 10, the total number of Shares reserved and available for Awards
under the Plan during the term hereof shall be 17 million shares. For purposes
of this Section 4, the number of and time at which Shares shall be deemed to be
subject to Awards and therefore counted against the number of Shares reserved
and available under the Plan shall be the earliest date at which the Committee
can reasonably estimate the number of Shares to be distributed in settlement of
an Award or with respect to which payments will be made; provided, however,
that, subject to the requirements of Rule 16b-3, the Committee may adopt
procedures for the counting of Shares relating to any Award for which the number
of Shares to be distributed or with respect to which payment will be made cannot
be fixed at the date of grant to ensure appropriate counting, avoid double
counting (in the case of tandem or substitute awards), and provide for
adjustments in any case in which the number of Shares actually distributed or
with respect to which payments are actually made differs from the number of
Shares previously counted in connection with such Award.

                                       3



      If any Shares to which an Award relates are forfeited or the Award is
settled or terminates without a distribution of Shares (whether or not cash,
other Awards, or other property is distributed with respect to such Award), any
Shares counted against the number of Shares reserved and available under the
Plan with respect to such Award shall, to the extent of any such forfeiture,
settlement or termination, again be available for Awards under the Plan;
provided, however, that such Shares shall be available for issuance only to the
extent that the related award would be exempt under Rule 16b-3.

      SECTION 5. ELIGIBILITY. Awards may be granted only to individuals who are
officers or other salaried employees (including employees who are also
directors) of the Corporation or a Subsidiary; provided, however, that no Award
shall be granted to any member of the Committee.

      SECTION 6. SPECIFIC TERMS OF AWARDS.

      6.01 General. Awards may be granted on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Section 6. In addition, the Committee may impose on any Award or the
exercise thereof, at the date of grant or thereafter (subject to Section 11.02),
such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of
the Plan, as the Committee shall determine, including without limitation the
acceleration of vesting of any Awards or terms requiring forfeiture of Awards in
the event of termination of employment by the Participant. Except as provided in
Section 7.04, only services may be required as consideration for the grant of
any Award.

      6.02 Performance Awards. Subject to the provisions of Sections 7.01 and
7.02, the Committee is authorized to grant Performance Awards to Participants on
the following terms and conditions:

            (i) Awards and Conditions. A Performance Award shall confer upon the
      Participant rights, valued as determined by the Committee, and payable to,
      or exercisable by, the Participant to whom the Performance Award is
      granted, in whole or in part, as determined by the Committee, conditioned
      upon the achievement of performance criteria determined by the Committee.

            (ii) Performance Period. The period of time with respect to which it
      is to be determined whether the performance criteria applicable to a
      Performance Award have been achieved shall not be less than one year,
      commencing not earlier than the date of grant of such Performance Award.

            (iii) Other Terms. A Performance Award shall be denominated in
      Shares and may be payable in cash, Shares, other Awards, or other
      property, and have such other terms as shall be determined by the
      Committee.

      6.03 Dividend Equivalents. The Committee is authorized to grant Dividend
Equivalents to Participants. The Committee may provide that Dividend Equivalents
shall be paid or distributed when accrued or shall be deemed to have been
reinvested in additional Shares or Awards, or otherwise reinvested.

      6.04 Restricted Stock. The Committee is authorized to grant Restricted
Stock to Participants on the following terms and conditions:

            (i) Issuance and Restrictions.

                  (a) Restricted Stock (other than Special Restricted Stock)
            shall be subject to such restrictions on transferability and other
            restrictions as the Committee may impose (including, without
            limitation, limitations on the right to vote such Restricted Stock
            or the right to receive dividends thereon), which restrictions shall
            lapse either: (x) in full with respect to all Shares underlying such
            Award of Restricted Stock at the expiration of a period not less
            than three years from the date of grant of such Award; or (y)
            proportionally in equal installments of the Shares underlying such
            Award of Restricted Stock over a period not less than three years
            from the date of grant of such Award, as the Committee shall
            determine, except that such restrictions may lapse earlier in the
            event of death, disability or retirement of an awardee, on such
            terms as the Committee shall determine, or in accordance with
            Section 9 hereof. The Committee shall not have the authority to
            otherwise accelerate the vesting of an Award of Restricted Stock
            under this Section 6.04(i)(a).

                  (b) Special Restricted Stock shall be subject to such
            restrictions on transferability and other restrictions as the
            Committee may impose (including, without limitation, limitations on
            the right to vote Special Restricted Stock or the right to receive
            dividends thereon) which restrictions may lapse separately or in
            combination at such times, under such circumstances, in such
            installments, or otherwise, as the Committee shall determine.

                                       4



            (ii) Forfeiture. Performance-Based Restricted Stock shall be
      forfeited unless preestablished performance criteria specified by the
      Committee are met during the applicable restriction period. Except as
      otherwise determined by the Committee, upon termination of employment (as
      determined under criteria established by the Committee) during the
      applicable restriction period, Restricted Stock that is at that time
      subject to restrictions shall be forfeited and returned to the
      Corporation; provided, however, that to the extent consistent with Section
      6.04(i)(a) above, the Committee may provide, by rule or regulation or in
      any Award Agreement, or may determine in any individual case after the
      award has been made, that restrictions or forfeiture conditions relating
      to Restricted Stock will be waived in whole or in part in the event of
      terminations resulting from specified causes.

            (iii) Certificates of Shares. Restricted Stock granted under the
      Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee shall determine. If
      certificates representing Restricted Stock are registered in the name of
      the Participant, such certificates shall bear an appropriate legend
      referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such
      Restricted Stock, the Corporation or an escrow agent acting on behalf of
      the Corporation shall retain physical possession of the certificates, and
      the Participant shall deliver a stock power to the Corporation or such
      agent, endorsed in blank, relating to the Restricted Stock.

            (iv) Dividends. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, cash
      dividends and other distributions made or paid with respect to the Shares
      underlying an Award of Restricted Stock or Performance-Based Restricted
      Stock shall be held in escrow, and may (but need not be) reinvested as
      determined by the Committee. Such dividends and other distributions shall
      be paid to the Participant, together with interest or other earnings
      thereon (if any), at the time the Shares are delivered to the Participant.
      Shares distributed in connection with a stock split or stock dividend, and
      other property distributed as a dividend or other distribution, shall be
      subject to restrictions and a risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the
      Restricted Stock or Performance-Based Restricted Stock with respect to
      which such stock or other property has been distributed.

      6.05 Deferred Stock. The Committee is authorized to grant Deferred Stock
to Participants, on the following terms and conditions:

            (i) Award and Restrictions.

                  (a) Delivery of Shares will occur upon expiration of the
            deferral period specified for Deferred Stock (other than Special
            Deferred Stock) by the Committee (or, if permitted by the Committee,
            as elected by the awardee), which deferral period shall not expire
            earlier than three years after the date of grant of such Award of
            Deferred Stock, except that such deferral period may expire earlier
            in the event of death, disability or retirement of an awardee, on
            such terms as the Committee shall determine, or in accordance with
            Section 9 hereof. In addition, Deferred Stock shall be subject to
            such other restrictions as the Committee may impose, which other
            restrictions shall lapse at the expiration of such deferral period.
            The Committee shall not have the authority to otherwise accelerate
            the expiration of the deferral period for an Award of Deferred Stock
            under Section 6.05(i)(a).

                  (b) Delivery of Shares will occur upon expiration of the
            deferral period specified for Special Deferred Stock by the
            Committee (or, if permitted by the Committee, by the awardee). In
            addition, Special Deferred Stock shall be subject to such
            restrictions as the Committee may impose, which restrictions may
            lapse at the expiration of the deferral period or at earlier
            specified times, separately or in combination, in installments, or
            otherwise, as the Committee shall determine.

            (ii) Forfeiture. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee,
      upon termination of employment (as determined under criteria established
      by the Committee) during the applicable deferral period or portion thereof
      (as provided in the Award Agreement evidencing the Deferred Stock), all
      Deferred Stock that is at that time subject to deferral (other than a
      deferral at the election of the Participant) shall be forfeited; provided,
      however, that to the extent consistent with Section 6.05(i)(a) above, the
      Committee may provide, by rule or regulation or in any Award Agreement, or
      may determine in any individual case, that restrictions or forfeiture
      conditions relating to Deferred Stock will be waived in whole or in part
      in the event of terminations resulting from specified causes, and the
      Committee may in other cases waive in whole or in part the forfeiture of
      Deferred Stock.

      6.06 Options. The Committee is authorized to grant Options to Participants
on the following terms and conditions:

            (i) Exercise Price. The exercise price per Share purchasable under
      an Option shall be determined by the Committee; provided, however, that,
      except as provided in Section 10, such exercise price shall be not less
      than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of such Option
      (or such higher exercise price as may be required under Section 422 of the
      Code). On and after the date of grant of an Option hereunder, the
      Committee shall not have the authority to amend such Option to reduce the
      exercise price thereof, except as provided in Section 10.

                                       5



            (ii) Time and Method of Exercise. The Committee shall determine the
      time or times at which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part, the
      methods by which such exercise price may be paid or deemed to be paid, the
      form of such payment, including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other
      Awards or awards issued under other Corporation plans, or other property
      (including notes or other contractual obligations of Participants to make
      payment on a deferred basis, such as through "cashless exercise"
      arrangements), and the methods by which Shares will be delivered or deemed
      to be delivered to Participants. Options shall expire not later than ten
      years after the date of grant.

            (iii) Incentive Stock Options. The terms of any Incentive Stock
      Option granted under the Plan shall comply in all respects with the
      provisions of Section 422 of the Code, including but not limited to the
      requirement that no Incentive Stock Option shall be granted more than ten
      years after the effective date of the Plan. Anything in the Plan to the
      contrary notwithstanding, no term of the Plan relating to Incentive Stock
      Options shall be interpreted, amended, or altered, nor shall any
      discretion or authority granted under the Plan be exercised, so as to
      disqualify either the Plan or any Incentive Stock Option under Section 422
      of the Code. In the event a Participant voluntarily disqualifies an Option
      as an Incentive Stock Option, the Committee may, but shall not be
      obligated to, make such additional Awards or pay bonuses as the Committee
      shall deem appropriate to reflect the tax savings to the Corporation which
      result from such disqualification.

      6.07 Stock Appreciation Rights. The Committee is authorized to grant Stock
Appreciation Rights to Participants on the following terms and conditions:

            (i) Right to Payment. A Stock Appreciation Right shall confer on the
      Participant to whom it is granted a right to receive, upon exercise
      thereof, the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date
      of exercise (or, if the Committee shall so determine in the case of any
      such right, other than one related to an Incentive Stock Option, the Fair
      Market Value of one Share at any time during a specified period before or
      after the date of exercise or the Change of Control Price as defined in
      Section 9.03) over (B) the base price of the Stock Appreciation Right as
      determined by the Committee as of the date of grant of the Stock
      Appreciation Right, which shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of
      one Share on the date of grant. On and after the date of grant of a Stock
      Appreciation Right hereunder, the Committee shall not have the authority
      to reduce the base price of such Stock Appreciation Right, except as
      provided in Section 10 hereof.

            (ii) Other Terms. The Committee shall determine the time or times at
      which a Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised in whole or in part, the
      method of exercise, method of settlement, form of consideration payable in
      settlement, method by which Shares will be delivered or deemed to be
      delivered to Participants, and any other terms and conditions of any Stock
      Appreciation Right. Limited Stock Appreciation Rights that may be
      exercised only upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as such term is
      defined in Section 9.02) or as otherwise defined by the Committee) may be
      granted under this Section 6.07. Stock Appreciation Rights shall expire
      not later than ten years after the date of grant.

      SECTION 7. CERTAIN PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS.

      7.01 Performance-Based Awards. Performance Awards and, Performance-Based
Restricted Stock, are intended to be "qualified performance-based compensation"
within the meaning of section 162(m) of the Code and shall be paid solely on
account of the attainment of one or more preestablished, objective performance
goals within the meaning of section 162(m) and the regulations thereunder. Until
otherwise determined by the Committee, the performance goal shall be the
attainment of preestablished levels of net income, market price per share,
return on equity, return on capital employed or cash flow, earnings per share,
book value per share or total shareholder return.

      The payout of any such Award to a Covered Employee may be reduced, but not
increased, based on the degree of attainment of other performance criteria or
otherwise at the discretion of the Committee.

      7.02 Maximum Awards. The maximum Share amounts in this Section 7.02 are
subject to adjustment under Section 10 and are subject to the Plan maximum under

      Value thereof) in the case of any individual Participant.

            7.02.2 Stock Options and SARS. Each individual Participant may not
      receive in any Year Awards of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights
      exceeding 250,000 Shares.

            7.02.3 Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock and Performance-Based
      Awards. A maximum of 4,500,000 Shares may be made subject to Awards of
      Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Awards, Performance-Based

granted under the Plan may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted
either alone or in addition to or in tandem with any other Award granted under
the Plan or any award granted under any other plan of the Corporation, any
Subsidiary, or any business entity to be acquired by the Corporation or a
Subsidiary, or any other right of a Participant to receive payment from the
Corporation or any Subsidiary. No Award may be granted in substitution for any
other Award theretofore granted under the Plan, and no Award may be
retroactively granted in tandem with any other Award theretofore granted under
the Plan at an exercise or base price less than that of such other previously
granted Award. Awards granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards or
awards may be granted either as of the same time as or a different time from the
grant of such other Awards or awards.

      7.04 Exchange Provisions. The Committee may at any time offer to exchange
or buy out any previously granted Award for a payment in cash, Shares, or other
property based on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine and
communicate to the Participant at the time that such offer is made.

      7.05 Term of Awards. The term of each Award shall be for such period as
may be determined by the Committee; provided, however, that in no event shall
the term of any Option or a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem therewith
exceed a period of ten years from the date of its grant (or such shorter period
as may be required under Section 422 of the Code).

      7.06 Form of Payment Under Awards. Subject to the terms of the Plan and
any applicable Award Agreement, payments to be made by the Corporation or a
subsidiary upon the grant or exercise of an Award may be made in such forms as
the Committee shall determine, including without limitation, cash, Shares, other
Awards, or other property, and may be made in a single payment or transfer, in
installments, or on a deferred basis. Such payments may include, without
limitation, provisions for the payment or crediting of reasonable interest on
installment or deferred payments or the grant or crediting of Dividend
Equivalents in respect of installment or deferred payments denominated in
Shares.

      7.07 Loan Provisions. With the consent of the Committee, and subject to
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the Corporation may make,
guarantee, or arrange for, a loan or loans to a Participant with respect to the
exercise of any Option or other payment in connection with any Award, including
the payment by a Participant of any or all federal, state, or local income or
other taxes due in connection with any Award. Subject to such limitations, the
Committee shall have full authority to decide whether to make a loan or loans
hereunder and to determine the amount, terms, and provisions of any such loan or
loans, including the interest rate to be charged in respect of any such loan or
loans, whether the loan or loans are to be with or without recourse against the
borrower, the terms on which the loan is to be repaid and conditions, if any,
under which the loan or loans may be forgiven. Nothing in this Section shall be
construed as implying that the Committee shall or will offer such loans.

      SECTION 8. GENERAL RESTRICTIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS.

      8.01 Restrictions Under Rule 16b-3.

            8.01.1 Six-Month Holding Period. Unless a Participant could
      otherwise transfer an equity security, derivative security, or Shares
      issued upon exercise of a derivative security granted under the Plan
      without incurring liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, (i)
      an equity security issued under the Plan, other than an equity security
      issued upon exercise or conversion of a derivative security granted under
      the Plan, shall be held for at least six months from the date of
      acquisition; (ii) with respect to a derivative security issued under the
      Plan, at least six months shall elapse from the date of acquisition of the
      derivative security to the date of disposition of the derivative security
      (other than upon exercise or conversion) or its underlying equity
      security; and (iii) any Award in the nature of a Stock Appreciation Right
      must be held for six months from the date of grant to the date of cash
      settlement.

            8.01.2 Nontransferability. Awards which constitute derivative
      securities (including any option, stock appreciation right, or similar
      right) shall not be transferable by a Participant except upon such terms
      and conditions as the Committee may determine to

                                       7



      an Immediate Family Member of such Participant, or to a trust, partnership
      or limited liability company all of whose beneficiaries, partners or
      members, as the case may be, are Immediate Family Members, or by will or
      the laws of descent and distribution (except pursuant to a beneficiary
      designation authorized under Section 8.02) or, if then permitted under
      Rule 16b-3, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined
      under the Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
      of 1974, as amended, or the rules thereunder, and, in the case of an
      Incentive Stock Option or, if then required by Rule 16b-3, any other
      derivative security granted under the Plan, shall be exercisable during
      the lifetime of a Participant only by such Participant or his legal
      representative.

            8.01.3 Compliance with Rule 16b-3. It is the intent of the
      Corporation that this Plan comply in all respects with Rule 16b-3 in
      connection with any Award granted to a person who is subject to Section 16
      of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, if any provision of this Plan or any
      Award Agreement does not comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 as
      then applicable to any such person, such provision shall be construed or
      deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements
      with respect to such person.

      8.02 Limits on Transfer of Awards; Beneficiaries. Except as provided in
Section 8.01.2, no right or interest of a Participant in any Award shall be
pledged, encumbered or hypothecated to or in favor of any party (other than the
Corporation or a Subsidiary), or shall be subject to any lien, obligation, or
liability of such Participant to any party (other than the Corporation or a
Subsidiary). Unless otherwise determined by the Committee (subject to the
requirements of Section 8.01.2), no Award subject to any restriction shall be
assignable or transferable by a Participant otherwise than by will or the laws
of descent and distribution (except to the Corporation under the terms of the
Plan); provided, however, that a Participant may, in the manner established by
the Committee, designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise the rights
of the Participant, and to receive any distribution, with respect to any Award,
upon the death of the Participant. A beneficiary, guardian, legal
representative, or other person claiming any rights under the Plan from or
through any Participant shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan
and any Award Agreement applicable to such Participant or Agreement applicable
to such, except to the extent the Plan and such Award Agreement or agreement
otherwise provide with respect to such persons, and to any additional
restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee.

      8.03 Registration and Listing Compliance. The Corporation shall not be
obligated to deliver any Award or distribute any Shares with respect to any
Award in a transaction subject to regulatory approval, registration, or any
other applicable requirement of federal or state law, or subject to a listing
requirement under any listing or similar agreement between the Corporation and
any national securities exchange, until such laws, regulations, and contractual
obligations of the Corporation have been complied with in full, although the
Corporation shall be obligated to use its best efforts to obtain any such
approval and comply with such requirements as promptly as practicable.

      8.04 Share Certificates. All certificates for Shares delivered under the
Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such
stop-transfer order and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable
under applicable federal or state laws, rules and regulations thereunder, and
the rules of any national securities exchange on which Shares are listed. The
Committee may cause a legend or legends to be placed on any such certificates to
make appropriate reference to such restrictions or any other restrictions that
may be applicable to Shares, including under the terms of the Plan or any Award
Agreement. In addition, during any period in which Awards or Shares are subject
to restrictions under the terms of the Plan or any Award Agreement, or during
any period during which delivery or receipt of an Award or Shares has been
deferred by the Committee or a Participant, the Committee may require the
Participant to enter into an agreement providing that certificates representing
Shares issuable or issued pursuant to an Award shall remain in the physical
custody of the Corporation or such other person as the Committee may designate.

      SECTION 9. CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISIONS. Notwithstanding any other
provision of the Plan, the following acceleration and valuation provisions shall
apply in the event of a "Change of Control" as defined in this Section 9.

      9.01 Acceleration and Cash-Out Rights. In the event of a "Change of
Control," as defined in Section 9.02, automatically in the case of all
Participants:

            (i) The performance criteria of all Performance Awards and
      Performance-Based Restricted Stock shall be deemed fully achieved and all
      such Awards shall be fully earned and vested, subject only to the
      restrictions on dispositions of equity securities set forth in Section
      8.01.1 and legal restrictions on the issuance of Shares set forth in
      Sections 8.03 and 8.04;

            (ii) Any Option, Stock Appreciation Right, and other Award in the
      nature of a right that may be exercised which was not previously
      exercisable and vested shall become fully exercisable and vested, subject
      only to the restrictions on disposition of equity securities set forth in
      Section 8.01.1 and legal restrictions on the issuance of Shares set forth
      in Sections 8.03 and 8.04;

                                       8



            (iii) The restrictions, deferral limitations, and forfeiture
      conditions applicable to any other Award granted under the Plan shall
      lapse and such Awards shall be deemed fully vested, subject only to the
      restrictions on dispositions of equity securities set forth in Section
      8.01.1 and legal restrictions on the issuance of Shares set forth in
      Sections 8.03 and 8.04;

            (iv) In the sole discretion of the Committee, all outstanding Awards
      may be cancelled and in such event a Participant holding any such Award
      shall be paid in cash therefor on the basis of the "Change of Control
      Price" (as defined in Section 9.03) as of the date that the Change of
      Control occurs, or such other date as the Committee may determine prior to
      the Change of Control; provided, however, that this Section 9.01(iv) shall
      not apply in the case of any Award if (a) the cancellation of and payment
      for such Award would cause the Participant to incur actual short-swing
      profits liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or (b) initial
      shareholder approval of the Plan has not been obtained; and

            (v) To the extent Section 9.01(iv) of this Section 9 does not apply
      and at any time after the Change of Control the Shares are no longer
      readily tradable on an established exchange, a Participant shall, as of
      the date on which the Change of Control occurs, be entitled to receive
      consistent with Rule 16b-3, and the Corporation shall use its best efforts
      to compel and obligate the surviving or resulting corporation in the
      Change of Control and/or the other party to the agreement or transaction
      resulting in the Change of Control to grant to the Participant, substitute
      Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and/or Restricted Stock, as the case
      may be, in respect of the shares of common stock or other capital stock of
      such surviving or resulting corporation, or such other party involved in
      the Change of Control, on such terms and conditions, as to the number of
      shares, pricing, vesting, exercisability and otherwise, which shall
      substantially preserve the value, rights and benefits of any affected
      Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and/or Restricted Stock, as the case
      may be, previously granted hereunder.

      9.02 Change of Control. For purposes of Section 9.01, a "Change of
Control" shall mean:

            (a) The acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the
      meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) of beneficial
      ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange
      Act) of 20% or more of either the then (i) outstanding shares of Common
      Stock of the Corporation (the "Outstanding Corporation Common Stock") or
      (ii) combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of
      the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
      (the "Outstanding Voting Securities") provided, however, that the
      following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control: (i) any
      acquisition by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any
      acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or
      maintained by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) any
      acquisition by any corporation with respect to which, following such
      acquisition, more than 51% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares
      of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting power of the
      then outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote
      generally in the election of directors is then beneficially owned,
      directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and
      entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding
      Corporation Common Stock and Outstanding Voting Securities immediately
      prior to such acquisition in substantially the same proportions as their
      ownership, immediately prior to such acquisition, of the Outstanding
      Corporation Common Stock and Outstanding Voting Securities, as the case
      may be, or (iv) any acquisition by one or more Hess Entity (for this
      purpose a "Hess Entity" means (A) Mr. Leon Hess or any of his children,
      (B) any spouse of any person described in Section 9.02(a)(iv)(A) above,
      (C) any affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the
      Exchange Act) of any person described in Section 9.02(a)(iv)(A) above, (D)
      the Hess Foundation Inc., or (E) any persons comprising a group controlled
      (as such term is defined in such Rule 12b-2) by one or more of the
      foregoing persons or entities described in this Section 9.02(a)(iv)); or

            (b) Individuals who, as of the effective date of the Plan,
      constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") ceasing for any reason to
      constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any
      individual becoming a director subsequent to the effective date of the
      Plan whose election, or nomination for election by the Corporation's
      shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the
      directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as
      though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but
      excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption
      of office occurs as a result of either an actual or threatened
      solicitation to which Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the
      Exchange Act applies or other actual threatened solicitation of proxies or
      consents; or

            (c) Approval by the shareholders of the Corporation of a
      reorganization, merger or consolidation, in each case, with respect to
      which all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were
      the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Corporation Common
      Stock and Outstanding Voting Securities immediately prior to such
      reorganization, merger or consolidation do not, following such
      reorganization, merger or consolidation, beneficially own, directly or
      indirectly, more than 51% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of
      common stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting

                                       9



      securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the
      case may be, of the corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger
      or consolidation in substantially the same proportions as their ownership,
      immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation, of the
      Outstanding Corporation Common Stock and Outstanding Voting Securities, as
      the case may be; or

            (d) Approval by the shareholders of the Corporation of (i) a
      complete liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation or (ii) the sale or
      other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
      Corporation, other than to a corporation, with respect to which following
      such sale or other disposition, more than 51% of, respectively, the then
      outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined
      voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation
      entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then
      beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of
      the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively,
      of the Outstanding Corporation Common Stock and Outstanding Voting
      Securities immediately prior to such sale or other disposition in
      substantially the same proportion as their ownership, immediately prior to
      such sale or other disposition, of the Outstanding Corporation Common
      Stock and Outstanding Voting Securities, as the case may be. The term "the
      sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
      Corporation" shall mean a sale or other disposition transaction or series
      of related transactions involving assets of the Corporation or of any
      direct or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation (including the stock of
      any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation) in which the value
      of the assets or stock being sold or otherwise disposed of (as measured by
      the purchase price being paid therefor or by such other method as the
      Board determines is appropriate in a case where there is no readily
      ascertainable purchase price) constitutes more than two-thirds of the fair
      market value of the Corporation (as hereinafter defined). The "fair market
      value of the Corporation" shall be the aggregate market value of the then
      Outstanding Corporation Common Stock (on a fully diluted basis) plus the
      aggregate market value of the Corporation's other outstanding equity
      securities. The aggregate market value of the shares of Outstanding
      Corporation Common Stock shall be determined by multiplying the number of
      shares of such Common Stock (on a fully diluted basis) outstanding on the
      date of the execution and delivery of a definitive agreement with respect
      to the transaction or series of related transactions (the "Transaction
      Date") by the average closing price of the shares of Outstanding
      Corporation Common Stock for the ten trading days immediately preceding
      the Transaction Date. The aggregate market value of any other equity
      securities of the Corporation shall be determined in a manner similar to
      that prescribed in the immediately preceding sentence for determining the
      aggregate market value of the shares of Outstanding Corporation Common
      Stock or by such other method as the Board shall determine is appropriate.

      9.03 Change of Control Price. For purposes of this Section 9, "Change of
Control Price" means the highest price per share paid in any transaction
reported on the securities exchange or trading system on which the Shares are
then primarily listed or traded, or paid or offered in any transaction related
to a Change of Control of the Corporation at any time during the preceding
60-day period as determined by the Committee, except that in the case of
Incentive Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights relating thereto, such
price shall be based only on transactions reported for the date on which the
Committee decides to cash out such Awards.

      SECTION 10. ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS. In the event that the Committee shall
determine that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash,
Shares, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or
share exchange, or other similar corporate transaction or event, affects the
Shares such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate
in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants under
the Plan, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable,
adjust any or all of (i) the number and kind of Shares which may thereafter be
issued in connection with Awards (ii) the number and kind of Shares issued or
issuable in respect of outstanding Awards, and (iii) the exercise price, base
price, or purchase price relating to any Award or, if deemed appropriate, make
provision for a cash payment with respect to any outstanding Award; provided,
however, in each case, that, with respect to Incentive Stock Options, no such
adjustment shall be authorized to the extent that such authority would cause the
Plan to violate Section 422(b)(1) of the Code. In addition, the Committee is
authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria
included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including,
without limitation, events described in the preceding sentence) affecting the
Corporation or any Subsidiary or the financial statements of the Corporation or
any Subsidiary, or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations, or
accounting principles.

      SECTION 11. CHANGES TO THE PLAN AND AWARDS.

      11.01 Changes to the Plan. The Board may amend, alter, suspend,
discontinue or terminate the Plan without the consent of shareholders or
Participants, except that any such amendment, alteration, suspension,
discontinuation, or termination shall be subject to the approval of the
Corporation's shareholders within one year after such Board action if such
amendment or alteration increases the number of shares reserved for Awards under
the Plan, changes the class of Participants eligible to receive Awards under the
Plan, or materially increases the benefits to Participants under the Plan, or if
such shareholder approval is required by any federal or state law

                                      10



or regulation or the rules of any stock exchange on which the Shares may be
listed in order to maintain compliance therewith, or if the Board in its
discretion determines that obtaining such shareholder approval is for any reason
advisable; provided, however, that, without the consent of an affected
Participant, no amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation, or
termination of the Plan after initial shareholder approval of the Plan may
materially impair the rights of such Participant under any Award theretofore
granted to him.

      11.02 Changes to Awards. The Committee may, unless otherwise expressly
prohibited by the Plan, waive any conditions or rights under, or amend, alter,
suspend, discontinue, or terminate, any Award theretofore granted and any Award
Agreement relating thereto; provided, however, that, without the consent of an
affected Participant, no such amendment, alteration, suspension,
discontinuation, or termination of any Award after initial shareholder approval
of the Plan may materially impair the rights of such Participant under such
Award.

      SECTION 12. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

      12.01 No Rights to Awards. No Participant or employee shall have any claim
to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for
uniformity of treatment of Participants and employees.

      12.02 No Shareholder Rights. No Award shall confer on any Participant any
of the rights of a shareholder of the Corporation unless and until Shares are
duly issued or transferred to the Participant in accordance with the terms of
the Award.

      12.03 Tax Withholding. To the extent and in the manner permitted by
applicable law, the Corporation or any Subsidiary is authorized to withhold from
any Award granted, any payment relating to an Award under the Plan, including
from a distribution of Shares, or any payroll or other payment to a Participant,
amounts or withholding and other taxes due with respect thereto, its exercise,
or any payment thereunder, and to take such other action as the Committee may
deem necessary or advisable to enable the Corporation and Participants to
satisfy obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and other tax
liabilities relating to any Award. This authority shall include authority to
withhold or receive Shares or other property and to make cash payments in
respect thereof in satisfaction of the Participant's tax obligations.

      12.04 No Right to Employment. Nothing contained in the Plan or any Award
Agreement shall confer, and no grant of an Award shall be construed as
conferring, upon any employee any right to continue in the employment of the
Corporation or any Subsidiary or to interfere in any way with the right of the
Corporation or any Subsidiary to terminate such employment at any time or
increase or decrease such employee's compensation from the rate in existence at
the time of granting of an Award.

      12.05 Unfunded Status of Awards. The Plan is intended to constitute an
unfunded incentive and deferred compensation plan for tax purposes and for
purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to
an Award the Plan constitutes a mere promise to make the benefit payments
provided for herein, and nothing contained in the Plan or any Award shall give
any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general
creditor of the Corporation; provided, however, that the Committee may authorize
the creation of trusts or make other arrangements to meet the Corporation's
obligations under the Plan to deliver cash, Shares, other Awards, or other
property pursuant to any award, which trusts or other arrangements shall be
consistent with the unfunded status of the Plan.

      12.06 Other Compensatory Arrangements. The Corporation or any Subsidiary
shall be permitted to adopt other or additional compensation arrangements (which
may include arrangements which relate to Awards), and such arrangements may be
either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.

      12.07 Fractional Shares. No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered
pursuant to the Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determined whether cash,
other Awards, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional
Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be
forfeited or otherwise eliminated.

      12.08 Governing Law. The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan,
any rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and any Award Agreement shall be
determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to principles of conflicts of laws, and applicable federal law.

      SECTION 13. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Plan shall be effective December 6, 1995.
The amendments to the Plan (as amended and restated hereby) shall be effective
May 5, 2004 subject to approval of such amendments as reflected in the Plan (as
amended and restated hereby) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the Shares present or represented and entitled to vote (and the

                                      11



affirmative vote of a majority of the Shares voting) at a meeting of the
Corporation's shareholders on May 5, 2004, or any adjournment thereof, and
subject to listing of the additional Shares authorized by such amendments on the
New York Stock Exchange. If such approval and listing are not obtained, such
amendments shall be void ab initio and of no force or effect. However, the Plan
(as in effect immediately prior to such amendments) shall continue in full force
and effect.

                                      12

                                 PURSUANT TO THE

                            AMERADA HESS CORPORATION
                              AMENDED AND RESTATED
                          1995 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

                                    * * * * *

OPTIONEE:       [NAME]

GRANT DATE:     [GRANT DATE]

NUMBER OF OPTION SHARES                              PER SHARE EXERCISE PRICE
  SUBJECT TO SUCH OPTION                                   FOR SUCH OPTION

[NUMBER OF OPTIONS]                                    [EXERCISE PRICE]

                                    * * * * *

            THIS STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of the
Grant Date specified above, is entered into by and between Amerada Hess
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), and the Optionee
specified above, pursuant to the Amerada Hess Corporation Amended and Restated
1995 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as in effect and as amended from time to time
(the "Plan"); and

            WHEREAS, it has been determined under the Plan that it would be in
the best interests of the Corporation to grant the stock option provided for
herein to the Optionee as an inducement to remain in the employment of the
Corporation (and/or any Subsidiary), and as an incentive for increased effort
during such employment;

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
premises hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration,
the parties hereto hereby mutually covenant and agree as follows:

      1.    INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE; DOCUMENT RECEIPT. This Agreement is
subject in all respects to the terms and provisions of the Plan (including,
without limitation, any amendments thereto adopted at any time and from time to
time unless such amendments are expressly not intended to apply to the grant of
the option hereunder), all of which terms and



                                     - 2 -

provisions are made a part of and incorporated in this Agreement as if each were
expressly set forth mutatis mutandis herein. Any capitalized term not defined in
this Agreement will have the same meaning as is ascribed thereto under the Plan.
The Optionee hereby acknowledges receipt of a disclosure document relating to
and describing the Plan and the Awards thereunder and that the Optionee has read
it carefully and fully understands its content. In the event of any conflict
between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the
Plan will control.

      2.    GRANT OF OPTIONS. As of the Grant Date specified above, the
Corporation hereby grants to the Optionee, non-qualified stock options (each, an
"Option" and collectively, the "Options") to acquire from the Corporation at the
Per Share Exercise Price specified above for such Option the aggregate number of
shares of the Common Stock specified above for such Option (the "Option
Shares"). The Option(s) are not to be treated as (and are not intended to
qualify as) incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of Code.

      3.    CASH PAYMENTS EQUIVALENT TO DIVIDENDS. Prior to the acquisition of
the Option Shares upon the exercise of any Option, the Optionee will not be
entitled to receive a cash payment or other distribution with respect to such
Option Shares underlying such Option.

      4.    EXERCISE OF THIS OPTION.

            4.1 Unless the exercisability of any Option is accelerated under the
terms of the Plan or this Agreement, all Options not theretofore terminated will
become exercisable on [VESTING DATE].

            4.2 Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the
Plan or this Agreement, all Options will expire and no longer be exercisable
after [EXPIRATION DATE].

            4.3 In no event will any Option be exercisable for a fractional
share of Common Stock.

      5.    METHOD OF EXERCISE AND PAYMENT. Once exercisable, an Option may be
exercised in whole or in part by the Optionee by delivering to the Secretary of
the Corporation or his designated agent on any business day (the "Exercise
Date") a written notice, in such manner and form as may be required by the
Corporation, specifying the number of the Option Shares the Optionee then
desires to acquire (the "Exercise Notice"). The Exercise Notice will be
accompanied by payment of the aggregate Per Share Exercise Price applicable to
such Option for such number of the Option Shares to be acquired upon such
exercise. Such payment will be made in cash, by personal or certified check,
bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Corporation or, if
permitted by the Committee (in its sole discretion) and applicable law, rule or
regulation, by delivery of, alone or in conjunction with a partial cash or
instrument payment, (a) shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant
for at least six months, or (b) some other form of payment acceptable to the
Committee. The Committee may also permit the Optionee to simultaneously exercise
an Option and sell the shares of Common Stock thereby acquired pursuant to a
"cashless exercise" arrangement or program, selected by and approved of in all
respects in advance by the Committee. Payment instruments will be received by
the Corporation subject to collection. The proceeds received by the Corporation
upon the exercise of



                                     - 3 -

any Option may be used by the Corporation for general corporate purposes. Any
portion of an Option that is exercised may not be exercised again. Upon exercise
in accordance with the terms of the Plan and this Agreement, the Option Shares
underlying the exercised portion of the Option will be promptly delivered to the
Optionee.

      6.    TERMINATION AND FORFEITURE.

            6.1 Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, all Options will
terminate in accordance with Sections 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 below, as the case may
be. In any event, all Options will terminate on [EXPIRATION DATE].

            6.2 Subject to any determination of the Committee pursuant to
Section 6.01 of the Plan, if an Optionee's employment with the Corporation or
any Subsidiary terminates for any reason (other than by reason of the Optionee's
death, disability or normal retirement under the Corporation's Employees'
Pension Plan or any successor plan thereto) all Options, to the extent not
exercisable on the date of any such termination of employment, will be forfeited
and cancelled by the Corporation. The Optionee's rights, if any, to exercise any
exercisable portion of any Option will terminate sixty days after the date of
any termination of employment (other than by reason of the Optionee's death,
disability, or normal or early retirement under the Corporation's Employees'
Pension Plan or any successor plan thereto), but not beyond [EXPIRATION DATE],
and thereafter all Options will be forfeited and cancelled by the Corporation.

            6.3 If an Optionee's employment with the Corporation or any
Subsidiary terminates by reason of the Optionee's death, disability, or normal
retirement under the Corporation's Employees' Pension Plan or any successor plan
thereto, the Optionee (or the Optionee's estate, designated beneficiary or other
legal representative, as the case may be and as determined by the Committee)
shall have the right to exercise all Options at any time until [EXPIRATION
DATE]. The existence and date of the Optionee's disability shall be determined
by the Committee and any such determination shall be conclusive.

            6.4 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.2
above, if the Optionee's employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary
terminates by reason of the Optionee's early retirement under the Corporation's
Employees' Pension Plan or any successor plan thereto, all Options to the extent
exercisable on the date of such early retirement shall remain exercisable until
[EXPIRATION DATE].

                (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.2
above, if the Optionee's employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary
terminates by reason of the Optionee's early retirement under the Corporation's
Employees' Pension Plan or any successor plan thereto, the Committee, in its
sole discretion, may (but is not obligated to) determine that (i) each Option to
the extent not exercisable at the time of any such early retirement will become
exercisable as to a proportionate number of underlying Option Shares based on
the number of calendar days between the Grant Date (as set forth above) and the
date of such early retirement over 365, and (ii) each such Option shall remain
exercisable until [EXPIRATION DATE]. Except for Options which have become
exercisable as described in the prior sentence, any Option



                                     - 4 -

to the extent not exercisable at the time of the Optionee's termination of
employment by reason of early retirement will be forfeited and cancelled by the
Corporation.

      7.    CHANGE OF CONTROL. The Options are subject to acceleration of
exercisability and "cash-out" at the discretion of the Committee upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control, all as provided in and subject to the Plan.

      8.    NON-TRANSFERABILITY. The Options, and any rights or interests
therein or under this Agreement, may not be sold, exchanged, transferred,
assigned or otherwise disposed of in any way at any time by the Optionee (or any
beneficiary(ies) of the Optionee), except to an Immediate Family Member or to a
trust, partnership or limited liability company all of whose beneficiaries,
partners or members, as the case may be, are Immediate Family Members, or by
testamentary disposition by the Optionee or the laws of descent and
distribution; provided, however, that to transfer an Option to an Immediate
Family Member or to an entity described above, such Immediate Family Member or
entity must agree, in a form acceptable to Committee, to be bound by the terms
of the Plan and this Agreement. The Options may not be pledged, encumbered or
otherwise hypothecated in any way at any time by the Optionee (or any
beneficiary(ies) of the Optionee) and will not be subject to execution,
attachment or similar legal process. Any attempt to sell, exchange, pledge,
transfer, assign, encumber or otherwise dispose of or hypothecate this Option,
or the levy of any execution, attachment or similar legal process upon this
Option, contrary to the terms of this Agreement and/or the Plan will be null and
void and without legal force or effect. During the Optionee's lifetime, the
Options may be exercisable only by the Optionee or the Optionee's legal
representative, or if transferred to an Immediate Family Member or an entity
comprising Immediate Family Members as described above, by such Immediate Family
Member or entity.

      9.    ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT. This Agreement (including the Plan
incorporated herein by reference) contains the entire agreement between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and
supersedes all prior agreements or prior understandings, whether written or
oral, between the parties relating to such subject matter. The Board has the
right, in its sole discretion, to amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or
terminate the Plan, and the Committee has the right, in its sole discretion, to
amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any or all of the Options or
this Agreement from time to time in accordance with and as provided in the Plan;
provided, however, that no such amendment, alteration, suspension,
discontinuance or termination after initial shareholder approval of the Plan may
materially impair the rights of the Optionee under this Option without the
consent of the Optionee. The Corporation will give written notice to the
Optionee of any such modification or amendment of this Agreement as soon as
practicable after the adoption thereof. This Agreement may also be modified,
amended or terminated by a writing signed by both the Corporation and the
Optionee.

      10.   NOTICES. Any Exercise Notice or other notice which may be required
or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing, and will be delivered in
person or via facsimile transmission, overnight courier service or certified

            10.1 If the notice is to the Corporation, to the attention of the
Secretary of Amerada Hess Corporation, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York,
New York 10036, or at such other address as the Corporation by notice to the
Optionee designates in writing from time to time.

            10.2 If the notice is to the Optionee, at his or her address as
shown on the Corporation's records, or at such other address as the Optionee, by
notice to the Corporation, designates in writing from time to time.

      11.   LIMITATIONS; GOVERNING LAW. Nothing herein or in the Plan will be
construed as conferring on the Optionee or anyone else the right to continue in
the employ of the Corporation or any Subsidiary. This Agreement will be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
reference to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.

      12.   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The issuance of this Option (and the Option
Shares upon exercise of this Option) pursuant to this Agreement will be subject
to, and will comply with, any applicable requirements of any federal and state
securities laws, rules and regulations (including, without limitation, the
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Exchange Act and the respective
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder), rules of any exchange on which
the Common Stock is listed (including, without limitation, the rules and
regulations of the New York Stock Exchange), and any other law or regulation
applicable thereto. The Corporation will not be obligated to issue this Option
or any of the Option Shares pursuant to this Agreement if any such issuance
would violate any such requirements, and if issued will be deemed void ab
initio.

      13.   BINDING AGREEMENT; FURTHER ASSURANCES. This Agreement will inure to
the benefit of, be binding upon, and be enforceable by the Corporation and its
successors and assigns. Each party hereto will do and perform (or will cause to
be done and performed) all such further acts and will execute and deliver all
such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents as any party
hereto reasonably may request in order to carry out the intent and accomplish
the purposes of this Agreement and the Plan and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereunder.

      14.   COUNTERPARTS; HEADINGS. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original, but all of
which will constitute one and the same instrument. The titles and headings of
the various sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of
reference only and will not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement.

      15.   SEVERABILITY. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions
of this Agreement in any jurisdiction will not affect the validity, legality or
enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement in such jurisdiction or the
validity, legality or enforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction, it being intended that all rights and obligations of the
parties hereunder will be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

      16.   BENEFICIARY. The Optionee may designate the beneficiary or
beneficiaries to exercise this Option (or to receive any Option Shares issuable
hereunder) after the death of the



                                     - 6 -

Optionee. Such designation may be made by the Optionee on the enclosed
beneficiary designation form and (unless the Optionee has waived such right) may
be changed by the Optionee from time to time by filing a new beneficiary
designation form with the Committee. If the Optionee does not designate a
beneficiary or if no designated beneficiary(ies) survives the Optionee, the
Optionee's beneficiary will be the legal representative of the Optionee's
estate.

      17.   TAX WITHHOLDING. Neither the exercise of any Option under this
Agreement, nor the issuance of any Option Shares thereunder, will be permitted
or effected unless and until the Optionee (or the Optionee's beneficiary(ies) or
legal representative) has made appropriate arrangements for the payment of any
amounts required to be withheld with respect thereto under all present or future
federal, state and local tax laws and regulations and other laws and
regulations.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Agreement to be
executed by its duly authorized officer, and the Optionee has hereunto set his
hand, all as of the Grant Date specified above.

            STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of the Grant
Date specified above, is entered into by and between Amerada Hess Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), and the Optionee specified above,
pursuant to the Amerada Hess Corporation Second Amended and Restated 1995
Long-Term Incentive Plan, as in effect and as amended from time to time (the
"Plan"); and

            WHEREAS, it has been determined under the Plan that it would be in
the best interests of the Corporation to grant the stock option provided for
herein to the Optionee as an inducement to remain in the employment of the
Corporation (and/or any Subsidiary), and as an incentive for increased effort
during such employment;

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
premises hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration,
the parties hereto hereby mutually covenant and agree as follows:

      1.    INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE; DOCUMENT RECEIPT. This Agreement is
subject in all respects to the terms and provisions of the Plan (including,
without limitation, any amendments thereto adopted at any time and from time to
time unless such amendments are expressly not intended to apply to the grant of
the option hereunder), all of which terms and



                                      -2-

provisions are made a part of and incorporated in this Agreement as if each were
expressly set forth mutatis mutandis herein. Any capitalized term not defined in
this Agreement will have the same meaning as is ascribed thereto under the Plan.
The Optionee hereby acknowledges receipt of a disclosure document relating to
and describing the Plan and the Awards thereunder and that the Optionee has read
it carefully and fully understands its content. In the event of any conflict
between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the
Plan will control.

      2.    GRANT OF OPTIONS. As of the Grant Date specified above, the
Corporation hereby grants to the Optionee, non-qualified stock options (each, an
"Option" and collectively, the "Options") to acquire from the Corporation at the
Per Share Exercise Price specified above for such Option the aggregate number of
shares of the Common Stock specified above for such Option (the "Option
Shares"). The Option(s) are not to be treated as (and are not intended to
qualify as) incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of Code.

      3.    CASH PAYMENTS EQUIVALENT TO DIVIDENDS. Prior to the acquisition of
the Option Shares upon the exercise of any Option, the Optionee will not be
entitled to receive a cash payment or other distribution with respect to such
Option Shares underlying such Option.

      4.    EXERCISE OF THIS OPTION.

            4.1 Unless the exercisability of any Option is accelerated under the
terms of the Plan or this Agreement, all Options not theretofore terminated will
become exercisable as follows: (i) one-third of the Option Shares (rounded to
the nearest whole number of shares) will become exercisable on the first
anniversary of the Grant Date (ii) one-third of the Option Shares (rounded to
the nearest whole number of shares) will become exercisable on the second
anniversary of the Grant Date and (iii) the remainder of the Option Shares will
become exercisable on the third anniversary of the Grant Date.

            4.2 Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the
Plan or this Agreement, all Options will expire and no longer be exercisable
after {EXPIRATION DATE}.

            4.3 In no event will any Option be exercisable for a fractional
share of Common Stock.

      5.    METHOD OF EXERCISE AND PAYMENT. Once exercisable, an Option may be
exercised in whole or in part by the Optionee by delivering to the Secretary of
the Corporation or his designated agent (who, for so long as the Corporation
maintains a "cashless exercise" program and the Optionee exercises and sells
Option Shares through such program, shall be the administrator of such program)
on any business day (the "Exercise Date") a notice, in such manner and form as
may be required by the Corporation, specifying the number of the Option Shares
the Optionee then desires to acquire (the "Exercise Notice"). The Exercise
Notice will be accompanied by payment of the aggregate Per Share Exercise Price
applicable to such Option for such number of the Option Shares to be acquired
upon such exercise. Such payment will be made in cash, by personal or certified
check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Corporation or, if
permitted by the Committee (in its sole discretion) and applicable law, rule or
regulation, by delivery of, alone or in conjunction with a partial cash or
instrument payment,



                                      -3-

(a) shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant for at least six
months, or (b) some other form of payment acceptable to the Committee. To the
extend permitted by law, the Committee may also allow the Optionee to
simultaneously exercise an Option and sell the shares of Common Stock thereby
acquired pursuant to a "cashless exercise" arrangement or program, selected by
and approved of in all respects in advance by the Committee. Payment instruments
will be received by the Corporation subject to collection. The proceeds received
by the Corporation upon the exercise of any Option may be used by the
Corporation for general corporate purposes. Any portion of an Option that is
exercised may not be exercised again. Upon exercise in accordance with the terms
of the Plan and this Agreement, the Option Shares underlying the exercised
portion of the Option will be promptly delivered to the Optionee, except that
for so long as the Corporation maintains a "cashless exercise" program and the
Optionee exercises and sells Option Shares through such program, delivery of the
proceeds of such sale shall be made to a brokerage account maintained in the
name of the Optionee with the administrator of such program.

      6.    TERMINATION AND FORFEITURE.

            6.1 Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, all Options will
terminate in accordance with Sections 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 below, as the case may
be. In any event, all Options will terminate on [EXPIRATION DATE].

            6.2 Subject to any determination of the Committee pursuant to
Section 6.01 of the Plan, if an Optionee's employment with the Corporation or
any Subsidiary terminates for any reason (other than by reason of the Optionee's
death, disability or normal retirement under the Corporation's Employees'
Pension Plan or any successor plan thereto) all Options, to the extent not
exercisable on the date of any such termination of employment, will be forfeited
and cancelled by the Corporation. The Optionee's rights, if any, to exercise any
exercisable portion of any Option will terminate sixty days after the date of
any termination of employment (other than by reason of the Optionee's death,
disability, or normal or early retirement under the Corporation's Employees'
Pension Plan or any successor plan thereto), but not beyond [EXPIRATION DATE],
and thereafter all Options will be forfeited and cancelled by the Corporation.

            6.3 If an Optionee's employment with the Corporation or any
Subsidiary terminates by reason of the Optionee's death, disability, or normal
retirement under the Corporation's Employees' Pension Plan or any successor plan
thereto, the Optionee (or the Optionee's estate, designated beneficiary or other
legal representative, as the case may be and as determined by the Committee)
shall have the right to exercise all Options at any time until [EXPIRATION
DATE]. The existence and date of the Optionee's disability shall be determined
by the Committee and any such determination shall be conclusive.



                                   -4-

            6.4 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.2
above, if the Optionee's employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary
terminates by reason of the Optionee's early retirement under the Corporation's
Employees' Pension Plan or any successor plan thereto, all Options to the extent
exercisable on the date of such early retirement shall remain exercisable until
[EXPIRATION DATE].

                (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.2
above, if the Optionee's employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary
terminates by reason of the Optionee's early retirement under the Corporation's
Employees' Pension Plan or any successor plan thereto, the Committee, in its
sole discretion, may (but is not obligated to) determine that (i) each Option to
the extent not exercisable at the time of any such early retirement will become
exercisable as to a proportionate number of underlying Option Shares based on
the number of calendar days elapsed (as of the date of such early retirement) in
the vesting period of such Option (or portion thereof), and (ii) each such
Option shall remain exercisable until [EXPIRATION DATE]. Except for Options
which have become exercisable as described in the prior sentence, any Option to
the extent not exercisable at the time of the Optionee's termination of
employment by reason of early retirement will be forfeited and cancelled by the
Corporation.

      7.    CHANGE OF CONTROL. The Options are subject to acceleration of
exercisability and "cash-out" at the discretion of the Committee upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control, all as provided in and subject to the Plan.

      8.    NON-TRANSFERABILITY. The Options, and any rights or interests
therein or under this Agreement, may not be sold, exchanged, transferred,
assigned or otherwise disposed of in any way at any time by the Optionee (or any
beneficiary(ies) of the Optionee), except to an Immediate Family Member or to a
trust, partnership or limited liability company all of whose beneficiaries,
partners or members, as the case may be, are Immediate Family Members, or by
testamentary disposition by the Optionee or the laws of descent and
distribution; provided, however, that to transfer an Option to an Immediate
Family Member or to an entity described above, such Immediate Family Member or
entity must agree, in a form acceptable to Committee, to be bound by the terms
of the Plan and this Agreement. The Options may not be pledged, encumbered or
otherwise hypothecated in any way at any time by the Optionee (or any
beneficiary(ies) of the Optionee) and will not be subject to execution,
attachment or similar legal process. Any attempt to sell, exchange, pledge,
transfer, assign, encumber or otherwise dispose of or hypothecate this Option,
or the levy of any execution, attachment or similar legal process upon this
Option, contrary to the terms of this Agreement and/or the Plan will be null and
void and without legal force or effect. During the Optionee's lifetime, the
Options may be exercisable only by the Optionee or the Optionee's legal
representative, or if transferred to an Immediate Family Member or an entity
comprising Immediate Family Members as described above, by such Immediate Family
Member or entity.

      9.    ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT. This Agreement (including the Plan
incorporated herein by reference) contains the entire agreement between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and
supersedes all prior agreements or prior understandings, whether written or
oral, between the parties relating to such subject matter. The Board has the
right, in its sole discretion, to amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or
terminate the



                                      -5-

Plan, and the Committee has the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, alter,
suspend, discontinue or terminate any or all of the Options or this Agreement
from time to time in accordance with and as provided in the Plan; provided,
however, that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance or
termination after initial shareholder approval of the Plan may materially impair
the rights of the Optionee under this Option without the consent of the
Optionee. The Corporation will give written notice to the Optionee of any such
modification or amendment of this Agreement as soon as practicable after the
adoption thereof. This Agreement may also be modified, amended or terminated by
a writing signed by both the Corporation and the Optionee.

      10.   NOTICES. Any notice (other than an Exercise Notice) which may be
required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing, and will be
delivered in person or via facsimile transmission, overnight courier service or
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, properly addressed as
follows:

            10.1 If the notice is to the Corporation, to the attention of the
Secretary of Amerada Hess Corporation, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York,
New York 10036, or at such other address as the Corporation by notice to the
Optionee designates in writing from time to time.

            10.2 If the notice is to the Optionee, at his or her address as
shown on the Corporation's records, or at such other address as the Optionee, by
notice to the Corporation, designates in writing from time to time.

      11.   LIMITATIONS; GOVERNING LAW. Nothing herein or in the Plan will be
construed as conferring on the Optionee or anyone else the right to continue in
the employ of the Corporation or any Subsidiary. This Agreement will be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
reference to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.

      12.   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The issuance of this Option (and the Option
Shares upon exercise of this Option) pursuant to this Agreement will be subject
to, and will comply with, any applicable requirements of any federal and state
securities laws, rules and regulations (including, without limitation, the
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Exchange Act and the respective
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder), rules of any exchange on which
the Common Stock is listed (including, without limitation, the rules and
regulations of the New York Stock Exchange), and any other law or regulation
applicable thereto. The Corporation will not be obligated to issue this Option
or any of the Option Shares pursuant to this Agreement if any such issuance
would violate any such requirements, and if issued will be deemed void ab
initio.

      13.   BINDING AGREEMENT; FURTHER ASSURANCES. This Agreement will inure to
the benefit of, be binding upon, and be enforceable by the Corporation and its
successors and assigns. Each party hereto will do and perform (or will cause to
be done and performed) all such further acts and will execute and deliver all
such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents as any party
hereto reasonably may request in order to carry out the intent and accomplish
the purposes of this Agreement and the Plan and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereunder.



                                      -6-

      14.   COUNTERPARTS; HEADINGS. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original, but all of
which will constitute one and the same instrument. The titles and headings of
the various sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of
reference only and will not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement.

      15.   SEVERABILITY. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions
of this Agreement in any jurisdiction will not affect the validity, legality or
enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement in such jurisdiction or the
validity, legality or enforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction, it being intended that all rights and obligations of the
parties hereunder will be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

      16.   BENEFICIARY. The Optionee may designate the beneficiary or
beneficiaries to exercise this Option (or to receive any Option Shares issuable
hereunder) after the death of the Optionee. Such designation may be made by the
Optionee on the enclosed beneficiary designation form and (unless the Optionee
has waived such right) may be changed by the Optionee from time to time by
filing a new beneficiary designation form with the Committee. If the Optionee
does not designate a beneficiary or if no designated beneficiary(ies) survives
the Optionee, the Optionee's beneficiary will be the legal representative of the
Optionee's estate.

      17.   TAX WITHHOLDING. Neither the exercise of any Option under this
Agreement, nor the issuance of any Option Shares thereunder, will be permitted
or effected unless and until the Optionee (or the Optionee's beneficiary(ies) or
legal representative) has made appropriate arrangements for the payment of any
amounts required to be withheld with respect thereto under all present or future
federal, state and local tax laws and regulations and other laws and
regulations. Unless an Optionee otherwise elects or is prohibited by law, if and
for so long as the Company maintains a cashless exercise program and an Optionee
exercises and sells Option Shares through such program, payment of such amounts
will be made by deducting such amounts from the proceeds of such sale.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Agreement to be

                              Amended and Restated
                            1995 Long-Term Incentive Plan
                              Award of Restricted Stock

Dear [NAME]:

            The Compensation and Management Development Committee (the
"Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Amerada Hess Corporation
(the "Corporation") acting under the Corporation's Amended and Restated 1995
Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") granted to you on [DATE OF GRANT] [the
"Grant Date"] [NUMBER OF SHARES] restricted shares of the Common Stock of the
Corporation in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Plan and this
letter agreement (the "Restricted Shares"). The Restricted Shares are restricted
for a period commencing on the date of grant and ending [VESTING DATE] and are
otherwise subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein If the conditions
set forth in the Plan and this letter agreement are not satisfied, this letter
agreement and the Restricted Shares awarded together with all rights and
interests relating thereto, shall be void and of no force or effect. One copy of
this letter agreement signed by you should be returned to Lee Kurtz, Manager -
Executive Compensation. The other copy should be retained for your records.

      1.    INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE; DOCUMENT RECEIPT. This letter agreement
is subject in all respects to the terms and provisions of the Plan (including,
without limitation, any amendments thereto adopted at any time and from time to
time unless such amendments are expressly not intended to apply to the grant of
Restricted Shares hereunder), all of which terms and provisions are made a part
of and incorporated in this letter agreement as if each were expressly set forth
mutatis mutandis herein. Any capitalized term not defined in this letter
agreement will have the same meaning as is described thereto under the Plan. You
hereby acknowledge receipt of a disclosure document relating to and describing
the Plan and the Awards thereunder and that you have read it carefully and fully
understand its content. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this
letter agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan will control.

      2.    RESTRICTED STOCK. A certificate for the Restricted Shares will be
issued in your name and deposited with The Bank of New York or other agent
designated by the Committee, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"). Prior to the
issuance and deposit of the Restricted Shares with the Escrow Agent you will
have no rights of a shareholder, and you will not be entitled to vote the
Restricted Shares or receive any dividends or other distributions, in respect of
the Restricted Shares.



Page 2

[DATE]

The Restricted Shares will be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to an agreement
(the "Escrow Agreement") between the Escrow Agent and the Corporation. The
accompanying stock transfer power covering the Restricted Shares to be issued to
you must be executed by you, endorsed in blank and returned to the Corporation
for delivery to the Escrow Agent. You will furnish the Escrow Agent with
additional stock transfer powers from time to time, if requested. Except to the
extent otherwise provided in the Plan or this letter agreement, if you remain
continuously employed by the Corporation or any Subsidiary until [VESTING DATE],
the Escrow Agent will deliver to you shortly thereafter a new share certificate
in your name representing the Restricted Shares.

      3.    RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER. While the Restricted Shares are held by the
Escrow Agent, you will be the record owner and will have all the rights of a
stockholder with respect to the Restricted Shares, including (without
limitation) the right to vote, subject to the restrictions provided for in the
Plan, the Escrow Agreement and this letter agreement. From and after the date on
which the Restricted Shares are issued in your name and deposited with the
Escrow Agent, cash dividends and other distributions made or paid with respect
to the Restricted Shares will be held by the Escrow Agent and may (but need not
be) reinvested as determined by the Committee, and such dividends and
distributions will be paid to you, together with interest or other earnings
thereon (if any), at the time and to the extent pro tanto that the Restricted
Shares become non-forfeitable and are delivered to you by the Escrow Agent. Any
new, additional or different securities that you may become entitled to receive
with respect to the Restricted Shares under the Plan by virtue of any
reinvestment of any cash dividends paid on the Common Stock or any stock
dividend, stock split, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation,
split-up, or any similar change affecting the Common Stock, will be delivered to
the Escrow Agent subject to the same restrictions, terms and conditions as apply
to the related Restricted Shares.

      4.    TERMINATION AND FORFEITURE.

            4.1 If your employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary
terminates prior to {VESTING DATE} by reason of your death, disability or normal
retirement under the Corporation's Employees' Pension Plan or any successor plan
thereto, the Escrow Agent will, as promptly as practicable, deliver to you (in
the case of disability or your normal retirement) or your beneficiary(ies) (in
the case of your death) a certificate representing all of the Restricted Shares
awarded to you hereunder and all accumulated dividends on the Restricted Shares,
together with interest or other earnings thereon (if any). The existence and
date of disability will be determined by the Committee and its determination
shall be final and conclusive.

            4.2 If your employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary
terminates prior to [VESTING DATE] for any reason other than your death,
disability or normal retirement under the Corporation's Employees' Pension Plan
or any successor plan thereto, all of the Restricted Shares, and any rights
thereto, awarded to you hereunder, all accumulated dividends in respect thereof
and interest thereon (if any) will be forfeited by you and returned by the
Escrow Agent to the Corporation and you will have no further rights with respect
thereto.

            4.3 Notwithstanding Section 4.2 above, if your employment with the
Corporation or any Subsidiary terminates prior to [VESTING DATE] by reason of
your early retirement under the Corporation's Employees' Pension Plan or any
successor plan thereto, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may (but is not
obligated to) determine that it will deliver to you



Page 3

[DATE]

on a specified date a certificate representing a proportionate number of the
Restricted Shares awarded to you hereunder based on the number of calendar days
elapsed (as of the date of such early retirement) in the vesting period ending
[VESTING DATE], together with a proportionate amount of the accumulated
dividends in respect thereof also based on the number of calendar days elapsed
(as of the date of such early retirement) in the vesting period ending [VESTING
DATE], and any interest or other earnings on such proportionate amount (if any).

      5.    CHANGE OF CONTROL. The Restricted Shares awarded to you hereunder
are subject to acceleration of vesting and "cash-out," all as provided in and
subject to the Plan.

      6.    BENEFICIARY. You may designate the beneficiary or beneficiaries to
receive any Restricted Shares or other amounts which may be delivered in respect
of this Award after your death. Such designation may be made by you on the
enclosed beneficiary designation form and (unless you have waived such right)
may be changed by you from time to time by filing a new beneficiary designation
form with the Committee. If you do not designate a beneficiary or if no
designated beneficiary(ies) survives you, your beneficiary will be the legal
representative of your estate.

      7.    TAX WITHHOLDING. No delivery of Restricted Shares or payment of any
accumulated cash dividends in respect thereof or other amount in respect of this
Award will be made unless and until you (or your beneficiary or legal
representative) have made appropriate arrangements for the payment of any
amounts required to be withheld with respect thereto under all present or future
federal, state and local tax laws and regulations and other laws and
regulations.

      8.    LIMITATIONS; GOVERNING LAW. Nothing herein or in the Plan will be
construed as conferring on you or anyone else the right to continue in the
employ of the Corporation or any Subsidiary. The rights and obligations under
this letter agreement and the Award are governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to the principles of
conflict of laws thereof.

      9.    NON-TRANSFERABILITY. The Restricted Shares, and any rights and
interests with respect thereto, issued under this letter agreement and the Plan
may not, prior to vesting, be sold, exchanged, transferred, assigned or
otherwise disposed of in any way by you (or any of your beneficiary(ies)), other
than by testamentary disposition or the laws of descent and distribution, or as
otherwise permitted by the Plan. The Restricted Shares, and any rights and
interests with respect thereto, may not, prior to vesting, be pledged,
encumbered or otherwise hypothecated in any way by you (or any of your
beneficiary(ies)) and will not, prior to vesting, be subject to execution,
attachment or similar legal process. Any attempt to sell, exchange, transfer,
assign, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of or hypothecate in any way any
of the Restricted Shares, or the levy of any execution, attachment or similar
legal process upon the Restricted Shares, contrary to the terms and provisions
of this letter agreement and/or the Plan will be null and void ab initio and
without legal force or effect. Each certificate evidencing the Restricted Shares
will bear a legend to this effect.

      10.   ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT. This letter agreement (including the
Plan which is incorporated herein by reference) contains the entire agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein,
and supersedes all prior agreements or prior



Page 4

such subject matter. The Board has the right, in its sole discretion, to amend,
alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan, and the Committee has the
right, in its sole discretion, to amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or
terminate one or more of the Awards of Restricted Stock or this letter agreement
from time to time in accordance with and as provided in the Plan; provided,
however, that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance or
termination after initial shareholder approval of the Plan may materially impair
your rights under this letter agreement or the Plan without your consent. The
Corporation will give you written notice of any such modification or amendment
of this letter agreement as soon as practicable after the adoption thereof. This
letter agreement may also be modified, amended or terminated by a writing signed
by you and the Corporation.

      11.   NOTICES. Any notice which may be required or permitted under this
letter agreement will be in writing and will be delivered in person, or via
facsimile transmission, overnight courier service or certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid, properly addressed as follows:

            11.1. If the notice is to the Corporation, to the attention of the
Secretary of Amerada Hess Corporation, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York,
New York 10036, or at such other address as the Corporation by notice to you may

            11.2. If the notice is to you, at your address as shown on the
Corporation's records, or at such other address as you, by notice to the

      12.   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. The issuance of the Restricted Shares pursuant
to this letter will be subject to, and will comply with, any applicable
requirements of federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations
(including, without limitation, the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933,
the Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder), any applicable rules of any exchange on which the Common Stock is
listed (including, without limitation, the rules and regulations of the New York
Stock Exchange), and any other law, rule or regulation applicable thereto. The
Corporation will not be obligated to issue any of the Common Stock subject to
this letter agreement if such issuance would violate any such requirements, and
if issued will be deemed void ab initio.

      13.   BINDING AGREEMENT; FURTHER ASSURANCES. This letter agreement will
inure to the benefit of, be binding upon, and be enforceable by the Corporation
and its successors and assigns. Each party hereto will do and perform (or will
cause to be done and performed) all such further acts and shall execute and
deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents as
any other party hereto reasonably may request in order to carry out the intent
and accomplish the purposes of this letter agreement and the Plan and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereunder.

      14.   COUNTERPARTS; HEADINGS. This letter agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original, but all of
which will constitute one and the same instrument. The titles and headings of
the various sections of this letter agreement have been inserted for convenience
of reference only and will not be deemed to be a part of this letter agreement.

      15.   SEVERABILITY. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions
of this letter agreement in any jurisdiction will not affect the validity,
legality or enforceability of the remainder of this letter agreement in such
jurisdiction or the validity, legality or enforceability of any provision of
this letter agreement in any other jurisdiction, it being intended that all
rights and obligations of the parties hereunder will be enforceable to the

Dear [NAME]:

            The Compensation and Management Development Committee (the

authorize the Escrow Agreement to transfer shares and otherwise act in
accordance with instructions of the Corporation. You will furnish the Escrow
Agent with stock transfer powers or authorizations from time to time, if

agreement, if you remain continuously employed by the Corporation or any
Subsidiary until [VESTING DATE], the Escrow Agent will, except as provided
below, deliver to you shortly thereafter a new share certificate in your name
representing the Restricted Shares. For as long as an account is maintained in
your name with a broker, custodian, or other institution retained by the
Corporation to assist in the administration of the Plan (the "Administrator"),
such Restricted Shares will be deposited into such account.

      3.    RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER. While the Restricted Shares are held by the
Escrow Agent, you will be the record owner and will have all the rights of a
stockholder with respect to the Restricted Shares, including (without

non-forfeitable and are delivered to you by the Escrow Agent. Any new,
additional or different securities that you may become entitled to receive with
respect to the Restricted Shares under the Plan by virtue of any reinvestment of
any cash dividends paid on the Common Stock or any stock dividend, stock split,
recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, or any
similar change affecting the Common Stock, will be delivered to the Escrow Agent
subject to the same restrictions, terms and conditions as apply to the related
Restricted Shares.

      4.    TERMINATION AND FORFEITURE.

            4.1 If your employment with the Corporation or any Subsidiary
terminates prior to [VESTING DATE] by reason of your death, disability or normal
retirement under the Corporation's Employees' Pension Plan or any successor plan
thereto, the Escrow Agent will, as promptly as practicable, deliver to you, or

disability or your normal retirement), or your beneficiary(ies) (in the case of
your death) a certificate representing all of the Restricted Shares awarded to
you hereunder and all accumulated dividends on the Restricted Shares, together
with interest or other earnings thereon (if any). The existence and date of
disability will be determined by the Committee and its determination shall be

terminates prior to [VESTING DATE] for any reason other than your death,
disability or normal retirement under the Corporation's Employees' Pension Plan
or any successor plan thereto, all of the Restricted Shares, and any rights
thereto, awarded to you hereunder, all accumulated dividends in respect thereof
and interest thereon (if any) will be forfeited by you and returned by the
Escrow Agent to the Corporation and you will have no further rights with respect

successor plan thereto, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may (but is not
obligated to) determine that it will deliver to you, or your account at the
Administrator referred to in Section 2, on a specified date a certificate
representing a proportionate number of the Restricted Shares awarded to you
hereunder based on the number of calendar days elapsed (as of the date of such
early retirement) in the vesting period ending [VESTING DATE], together with a
proportionate amount of the accumulated dividends in respect thereof also based

accumulated cash dividends in respect thereof or other amount in respect of this
Award will be made unless and until you (or your beneficiary or legal
representative) have made appropriate arrangements for the payment of any

federal, state and local tax laws and regulations and other laws and
regulations. Unless you elect otherwise or are prohibited by law, such number of
Restricted Shares as shall be necessary to pay such withholding amounts shall be
sold by the Administrator and the proceeds thereof shall be delivered to the
Company for remittance to the appropriate governmental authorities, and the
remaining Restricted Shares shall be delivered to you, or your account at the
Administrator referred to in Section 2.

         8. LIMITATIONS; GOVERNING LAW. Nothing herein or in the Plan will be
construed as conferring on you or anyone else the right to continue in the
