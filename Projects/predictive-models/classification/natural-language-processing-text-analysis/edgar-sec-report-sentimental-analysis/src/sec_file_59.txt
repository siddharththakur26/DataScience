Notwithstanding Article 9.2 of the AGTA, Boeing agrees that Customer may from time to time prior to delivery of any Relevant Aircraft enter into arrangements and agreements with lenders, lessors or other parties (whose business includes, but may not be limited to, the financing of aircraft) for the purpose of (a) [CONFIDENTIAL PORTION OMITTED

[CONFIDENTIAL PORTION OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT] the Purchase Agreement in connection with [CONFIDENTIAL PORTION OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT] is contingent upon Boeing’s consent, which shall not
