item 2. management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business introduction when we use the terms american express , the company , we , our or us , we mean american express company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless we state or the context implies otherwise. we are a global services company with four reportable operating segments u.s. card services uscs , international card services ics , global commercial services gcs and global network and merchant services gnms . we provide our customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. our principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world. our range of products and services includes charge and credit card products expense management products and services consumer and business travel services stored value products such as travelers cheques and other prepaid products network services merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point of sale, marketing and information products and services for merchants and fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design of customized customer loyalty and rewards programs. our products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid sized companies and large corporations. these products and services are sold through various channels, including direct mail, online applications, in house and third party sales forces and direct response advertising. we compete in the global payments industry with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, as well as evolving alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products. as the payments industry continues to evolve, we face increasing competition from non traditional players that leverage new technologies and customers existing card accounts and bank relationships to create payment or other fee based solutions. we are transforming our existing businesses and creating new products and services for the digital marketplace as we seek to enhance our customers digital experiences and develop platforms for online and mobile commerce. emerging technologies also provide an opportunity to deliver financial products and services that help new and existing customer segments move and manage their money, which we are pursuing through our enterprise growth group egg . our products and services generate these types of revenue for the company discount revenue, our largest revenue source, which represents fees generally charged to merchants when card members use their cards to purchase goods and services at merchants on the company s network net card fees, which represent revenue earned for annual card membership fees travel commissions and fees, which are earned by charging a transaction or management fee to both customers and suppliers for travel related transactions other commissions and fees, which are earned on foreign exchange conversions, card related fees and assessments and other service fees 27 table of contents other revenue, which represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our global network services gns business including royalties and signing fees , insurance premiums earned from card member travel and other insurance programs, travelers cheques, and prepaid card related revenues and other miscellaneous revenue and fees and interest on loans, which principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances. in addition to funding and operating costs associated with these types of revenue, other major expense categories are related to marketing and rewards programs that add new card members and promote card member loyalty and spending, and provisions for card member credit and fraud losses. financial targets we seek to achieve three financial targets, on average and over time revenues net of interest expense growth of at least 8 percent earnings per share eps growth of 12 to 15 percent and return on average equity roe of 25 percent or more. if we achieve our eps and roe targets, we will seek to return on average and over time approximately 50 percent of the capital we generate to shareholders as dividends or through the repurchases of common stock, which may be subject to certain regulatory restrictions as described herein. forward looking statements and non gaap measures certain of the statements in this form 10 q are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. refer to the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements section. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap . however, certain information included within this form 10 q constitute non gaap financial measures. our calculations of non gaap financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. bank holding company american express company is a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 and the board of governors of the federal reserve the federal reserve is our primary federal regulator. as such, we are subject to the federal reserve s regulations, policies and minimum capital standards. current business environment outlook our results for the first quarter of 2014 reflect increased spending by card members, continued low write off rates and lower operating expenses while our strong balance sheet allowed us to return a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders. billed business grew 6 percent over the prior year, with higher volumes in the u.s. and internationally. billed business and revenue growth remained solid but slowed modestly from the fourth quarter of 2013. in addition, the stronger u.s. dollar continued to put downward pressure on our billed business and revenue growth. average loans also continued to grow year over year, which, along with lower funding costs, led to an 8 percent increase in net interest income. at the same time, lending write off rates remained near historically low levels. we expect, at some point, lending write off rates will increase from such levels. 28 table of contents total expenses decreased 1 percent over the prior year. while marketing and promotion expenses were relatively flat in the quarter, we anticipate investment levels will increase this year beginning in the second quarter. operating expenses decreased 4 percent, as compared to the prior year. we would not expect to see similar year over year declines in operating expenses for the remaining quarters, although we remain committed to our aim to have operating expenses grow at an annual rate of less than 3 percent in 2014. we have seen a modest increase in our effective tax rate in the quarter primarily because of the changes in the geographic mix of where we generate income. additionally, we are being impacted by certain tax law changes in 2014 and believe our effective tax rate for the full year 2014 could be closer to the mid 30 percent range. as discussed below within certain legislative, regulatory and other developments, the regulatory environment continues to evolve and has heightened the focus that all financial services firms, including us, must have on controls and processes. the review of products and practices will be a continuing focus of ours, as well as regulators. in addition, regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years and governments in several countries have established or are proposing to establish payment system regulatory regimes. competition remains extremely intense across our businesses. while our business is diversified, including the corporate card business, a large international business and gns partners around the world, the global economic environment remains challenging. in addition, any impact of potential u.s. income tax law changes or volatility in foreign exchange rates remains uncertain. we previously announced that we signed an agreement to create a joint venture for our global business travel gbt division. in the proposed transaction, we will separate our gbt operations into a dedicated holding structure, which will include certain assets and liabilities that currently comprise gbt, and will have an approximate 50 percent ownership stake in a non consolidated joint venture following the closing. in exchange for an investment of 900 million in the joint venture, an investor group will hold the remaining interest. the closing of the joint venture transaction is subject to the receipt of requisite regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. assuming these conditions are met, we would plan to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2014. upon closing, we expect to recognize a pre tax gain, which we currently estimate to be between 600 million to 700 million, before transaction costs. we would expect to use a substantial portion of the gain recognized upon a closing of the transaction, net of transaction costs, to invest in growth initiatives and to increase the efficiency of our organization. 29 table of contents american express company consolidated results of operations refer to the glossary of selected terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section. table 1 summary of financial performance three months endedmarch 31, change millions, except percentages and per

average tangible common equity, a non gaap measure, is computed in the same manner as roe except the computation of average tangible common equity, a non gaap measure, excludes from average total shareholders equity, average goodwill and other intangibles of 4.0 billion and 4.2 billion as of march 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we believe return on average tangible common equity is a useful measure of the profitability of our business. table 2 total revenue net of interest expense summary three months endedmarch 31, change millions, except percentages, per share amounts and ratio data 2014 2013 2014 vs. 2013 discount revenue 4,646 4,438 208 5 net card fees 674 653 21 3 travel commissions and fees 423 437 14 3 other commissions and fees 618 573 45 8 other 501 537 36 7 total non

318 4 total revenues net of interest expense discount revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2014 increased 208 million or 5 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year. the increase reflects a 6 percent growth in billed business in the us and outside the us, which was partially offset by higher cash rebate rewards. excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates billed business outside the u.s. increased 10 percent.1 see tables 5 and 6 for more detail on billed business performance. the average discount rate was 2.52 percent for both the three months ended march 31, 2014 and 2013. as indicated in prior quarters, changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, volume related pricing discounts, strategic investments, certain pricing initiatives and other factors will likely result in erosions of the average discount rate over time. net card fees increased 21 million or 3 percent for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting higher average proprietary cards in force primarily in uscs and ics. 1 the foreign currency adjusted information, a non gaap measure, assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into u.s. dollars i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current year apply to the corresponding year period against which such results are being compared . we believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 30 table of contents travel commissions and fees decreased 14 million or 3 percent for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year. worldwide travel sales were flat, while us consumer travel sales declined 7 percent largely due to the sale of our wholesale tour operator business in the prior year. other commissions and fees increased 45 million or 8 percent for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year. the increase was primarily due to higher revenue from our loyalty partner business and delinquency fees. other revenue decreased 36 million or 7 percent for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year. the decrease reflects the loss of revenue from the divested publishing business, partially offset by higher loyalty edge revenue and a larger gain on the sale of investment securities. interest income increased 14 million or 1 percent for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year. the increase reflects higher interest on loans, driven by growth in average card member loans, partially offset by decreases in interest and dividends on investment securities, driven by lower average investment securities. interest expense decreased 80 million or 15 percent for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year. the decrease reflects lower interest on deposits, as a result of lower funding costs, partially offset by increases in average customer deposit balances. the decrease also reflects lower funding costs on long term debt and lower average long term debt balances. table 3 provisions for losses summary three months endedmarch 31, change millions, except percentages 2014 2013 2014 vs. 2013 charge

increased 69 million or 17 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year. charge card provision for losses increased 61 million or 40 percent, driven by higher average card member receivable balances resulting in higher net write offs and reserve builds for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to reserve releases for the same period in the prior year. card member loans provision for losses also increased, driven by lower reserve releases for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by the benefit of lower net write offs. table 4 expenses summary three months endedmarch 31, change millions, except percentages 2014 2013 2014 vs. 2013 marketing and promotion 613 621 8 1 card member rewards 1,582

the same period in the prior year. card member rewards expense increased 62 million or 4 percent for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year. the increase reflects higher co brand rewards expense of 29 million, primarily relating to higher spending volumes and an increase in membership rewards expense of 33 million. the current year increase in membership rewards expense is primarily due to a 49 million increase relating to higher new points earned, partially offset by a 16 million decrease related to membership rewards points earned by card members but not redeemed. this decrease is driven by slower growth in the ultimate redemption rate urr as compared to the same period in the prior year. the membership rewards urr for current program participants was 94 percent rounded down at march 31, 2014, an increase from 94 percent rounded up at march 31, 2013. the increase in the urr reflects greater engagement in our membership rewards program. card member services and other expense increased 33 million or 17 percent for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting increased engagement levels and usage of certain card member benefits. salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 75 million or 5 percent for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by lower payroll expense, primarily attributable to previously announced restructuring initiatives, as well as the sale of the publishing business. other expenses for the three months ended march 31, 2014 decreased 62 million or 4 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a benefit from enhancements to the estimation process for potential losses from non delivery of goods and services by merchants for card member purchases and higher legal fees in the prior year, partially offset by deal related costs associated with the planned business travel joint venture in 2014. income taxes the effective tax rate was 35.1 percent and 32.9 percent for the three months ended march 31, 2014, and 2013, respectively. the tax rates for both periods primarily reflect the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business. additionally, in 2014 the tax rate was impacted by certain changes in tax laws, including the delay in the renewal of the active financing exemption and the loss of the research and development tax credit. by comparison, in the same period in 2013, the tax rate was impacted by an additional benefit from active financing due to the legislation being renewed in january 2013. 32 table of contents table 5 selected statistical information three

member spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards in force. the adjusted average fee per card, which is a non gaap measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. the amount of amortization excluded was 73 million and 65 million for the three months ended march 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we present adjusted average fee per card because we believe this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of our proprietary card products. 33 table of contents table 6 selected statistical information

revenues increased 139 million or 5 percent for the three months ended march 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher discount revenue, resulting from billed business growth, and higher net card fees. billed business for the three months ended march 31, 2014 increased 7 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by a 3 percent increase in average spending per proprietary basic card and 4 percent higher cards in force. interest income increased 37 million or 3 percent for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a 4 percent increase in average card member loans, partially offset by higher card member reimbursements. interest expense decreased 32

or 3 percent. the increase reflects higher co brand rewards expense of 29 million, primarily relating to higher spending volumes, and an increase in membership rewards expense of 8 million. the current year increase in membership rewards expense is primarily due to higher new points earned, partially offset by a decrease related to membership rewards points earned by card members but not

included in corporate other. corporate other had net expense of 230 million and 266 million for the three months ended march 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the decrease in net expense for the three months ended march 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily driven by lower salary and benefit expense attributable to previously announced restructuring initiatives and lower interest expense. results for both periods disclosed included net interest expense related to maintaining the liquidity pool discussed in consolidated capital resources and liquidity liquidity management , as well as interest expense related to other corporate indebtedness. consolidated capital resources and liquidity our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain a solid and flexible equity capital profile a broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements and liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12 month period, even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. capital strategy our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth. we believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. the level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process, which reflects our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements. as a bank holding company, we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the u.s. federal banking agencies. the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items. beginning in 2014, as a basel iii advanced approaches institution, we report our capital ratios using basel iii capital definitions, inclusive of transition provisions, and basel i risk weighted assets. beginning in 2015, we will report our capital ratios using the basel iii capital definitions, inclusive of transition provisions, and the basel iii standardized approach for calculating risk weighted assets. the basel iii standards will be fully phased in by january 1, 2019. we have also adopted basel iii in certain non u.s. jurisdictions. during 2014, we will begin reporting capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under basel requirements for a basel iii advanced approaches institution. the parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting and subsequently begin publicly reporting our capital ratios using both basel iii standardized and advanced approaches. 46 table of contents the following table presents our regulatory risk based capital ratios and leverage ratios and our significant bank subsidiaries, as well as additional ratios widely utilized in the marketplace, as of march 31, 2014. table 17 regulatory risk based capital and leverage ratios basel iiistandards2014 a ratios as

risk weighted assets b american express company 12.6 a transitional basel iii minimum and conservation buffer as defined by the federal reserve for calendar year 2014 for advanced approaches institutions. b refer to page 48 for discussion on tangible common equity, a non gaap measure. the transition provisions for 2014 under basel iii cause our reported capital ratios to be higher than they would have been under the prior regulatory standards, known as basel i. specifically, the common equity tier 1 risk based capital and tier 1 risk based capital ratios would have been approximately 40 basis points lower under basel i. the largest contributor to the difference is the way intangible assets are being treated and ultimately transitioned in over a 5 year period under basel iii. the following provides definitions for our regulatory risk based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance, if applicable risk weighted assets assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the federal reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. on and off balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk adjusted weight. the off balance sheet items comprise a minimal part of the overall calculation. risk weighted assets under basel i as of march 31, 2014 were 126.8 billion. common equity tier 1 risk based capital ratio the common equity tier 1 risk based capital ratio is calculated as common equity tier 1 capital, divided by risk weighted assets. common equity tier 1 is the sum of common shareholders equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows net unrealized gains losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit losses, all net of tax. common equity tier 1 capital as of march 31, 2014 was 17.2 billion. 47 table of contents tier 1 risk based capital ratio the tier 1 capital ratio is calculated as tier 1 capital, divided by risk weighted assets. tier 1 capital is the sum of common equity tier 1 capital, certain perpetual preferred stock not applicable to us , and non controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries. tier 1 capital as of march 31, 2014 was 17.2 billion. total risk based capital ratio the total risk based capital ratio is calculated as the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital, divided by risk weighted assets. tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for receivable and loan losses limited to 1.25 percent of risk weighted assets and a portion of the unrealized gains on equity securities, plus a 750 million subordinated hybrid security, for which we received approval from the federal reserve for treatment as tier 2 capital. tier 2 capital as of march 31, 2014 was 2.0 billion. the 750 million subordinated hybrid security is not expected to meet the requirements of tier 2 capital under basel iii, and will begin to be transitioned out of capital beginning in 2014. see fully phased in basel iii section. tier 1 leverage ratio the tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. average total consolidated assets as of march 31, 2014 were 148.8 billion. the following provides a definition for tangible common equity to risk weighted assets ratio, which is widely used in the marketplace, although it may be calculated differently by different companies common equity and tangible common equity to risk weighted assets ratios common equity equals our shareholders equity of 20.0 billion as of march 31, 2014, and tangible common equity, a non gaap measure, equals common equity less goodwill and other intangibles of 4.0 billion as of march 31, 2014. we believe presenting the ratio of tangible common equity to risk weighted assets is a useful measure of evaluating the strength of our capital position. we seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit our business operations. our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. historically, capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, has exceeded the annual growth in our capital requirements. to the extent capital has exceeded business, regulatory and rating agency requirements, we have historically returned excess capital to shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program. we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. for example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level. we do not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non u.s. subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a u.s. parent company. 48 table of contents fully phased in basel iii basel iii, when fully phased in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain more capital than prior requirements, with a greater emphasis on common equity. we estimate that had basel iii been fully phased in during the three months ended march 31, 2014, our reported common equity tier 1 risk based capital and tier 1 risk based capital ratios would have been 12.8 percent and our reported tier 1 leverage ratio would have been 11.1 percent. as of march 31, 2014, had the basel iii rules been fully phased in, our supplementary leverage ratio would be 9.3 percent.6 these ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk weighted assets. as noted previously, we are currently taking steps toward basel iii advanced approaches implementation in the u.s. our 750 million subordinated hybrid security, which was previously fully included in tier 2 capital but not in tier 1 capital , does not meet the requirements of tier 2 capital under basel iii. the phase out of this subordinated hybrid security from tier 2 capital begins in 2014, which will affect our total risk based capital ratio beginning in 2014 however, this ratio is expected to remain well in excess of the required minimum. the following provides definitions for fully phased in basel iii capital ratios as defined by the basel iii rules using the standardized approach. all calculations are non gaap measures. fully phased in basel iii common equity tier 1 risk based capital ratio the fully phased in basel iii common equity tier 1 risk based capital ratio is calculated as common equity tier 1 under fully phased in basel iii rules divided by risk weighted assets under fully phased in basel iii rules. fully phased in basel iii tier 1 risk based capital ratio the fully phased in basel iii tier 1 risk based capital ratio is calculated as tier 1 capital under fully phased in basel iii rules divided by adjusted risk weighted assets under fully phased in basel iii rules. the following table presents a comparison of our common equity tier 1 and tier 1 risk based capital under transitional basel iii rules to our estimated common equity tier 1 and tier 1 risk based capital under fully phased in basel iii rules. table 18 transitional basel iii versus fully phased in basel iii axp billions march 31, 2014 risk based capital under transitional basel iii 17.2 adjustments related to aoci

risk weighting applied to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns. the fully phased in basel iii risk weighted assets as of march 31, 2014 were estimated to be 127.9 billion. 6 the fully phased in basel iii capital ratios are non gaap measures. we believe the presentation of the capital ratios is helpful to investors by showing the impact of future regulatory capital standards on our capital ratios. 49 table of contents fully phased in basel iii tier 1 leverage ratio the fully phased in basel iii tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing fully phased in basel iii tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets. basel iii supplementary leverage ratio the supplementary leverage ratio under fully phased in basel iii rules is calculated by dividing fully phased in basel iii tier 1 capital by our total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes under basel iii. total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes reflect total consolidated assets with adjustments for tier 1 capital deductions, off balance sheet derivatives, undrawn unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off balance sheet liabilities. total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes as of march 31, 2014 were estimated to be 176.1 billion. share repurchases and dividends we have a share repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders. the share repurchases reduce shares outstanding and offset, in whole or part, the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. during the three months ended march 31, 2014, we returned approximately 1.2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends 243 million and share repurchases 937 million . we repurchased 10.5 million common shares at an average price of 88.97 in first quarter of 2014. these dividend and share repurchase amounts represent approximately 73 percent of total capital generated during the quarter. this percentage for 2014 is significantly greater than the on average and over time target to distribute approximately 50 percent of the capital to shareholders as dividends or through the repurchases of common stock. these distribution percentages result from the strength of our capital ratios and the amount of capital we generate from net income and through employee stock plans in relation to the amount of capital required to support our organic business growth and through acquisitions. on march 26, 2014, we announced our capital distribution plan outlining our intent to repurchase up to 4.4 billion of shares in 2014 and up to 1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2015, as well as increase our quarterly dividend from 0.23 per share to 0.26 per share beginning with the second quarter 2014 dividend declaration, subject to approval by our board of directors. funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. the diversity of funding sources by type of debt instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of debt, maturity or investor. the mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives. our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset liability management activities. we have in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of our subsidiaries. our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset generating businesses, with significant assets in both domestic and international card member receivable and lending activities. our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities, such as merchant payments. we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by card members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period card member loans and receivables are outstanding. we also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes, including acquisition activities. 50 table of contents we seek to raise funds to meet all of our financing needs, including seasonal and other working capital needs, while also seeking to maintain sufficient cash and readily marketable securities that are easily convertible to cash, in order to meet the scheduled maturities of all long term funding obligations on a consolidated basis for a 12 month period. management does not currently expect to make any significant changes to our funding programs or liquidity strategy in order to satisfy basel iii s liquidity coverage ratio standard based upon our current understanding of the requirements. during the first quarter of 2014, american express credit corporation issued 2.3 billion dual tranche senior unsecured debt consisting of i 1.3 billion of fixed rate senior notes with a maturity of 5 years and a coupon of 2.125 percent and ii 1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes with a maturity of 5 years at a rate of 3 month libor plus 55 basis points. our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies moody s investor services moody s , standard poor s s p , fitch ratings fitch and dominion bond rating services dbrs . such ratings help support our access to cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. our asset backed securitization abs activities are rated

securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. we believe our funding mix, including the proportion of u.s. retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic , should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. deposit programs we offer deposits within our american express centurion bank centurion bank and american express bank, fsb fsb subsidiaries together, the banks . these funds are currently insured up to 250,000 per account holder through the fdic. our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the banks capital levels. we, through the fsb, have a direct retail deposit program, personal savings from american express, to supplement our distribution of deposit products sourced through third party distribution channels. the direct retail program makes fdic insured certificates of deposit cds and high yield savings account products available directly to consumers. 51 table of contents we held the following deposits as of march 31 table 20 customer deposits billions march 31,2014 december 31, 2013 u.s. retail deposits savings

retail cds, issued through direct and third party programs, were 48.5 months and 1.69 percent, respectively, as of march 31, 2014. asset securitization programs we periodically securitize card member receivables and loans arising from our card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost effective funding. securitization of card member receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third party investors. the proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. the receivables and loans being securitized are reported as assets on our consolidated balance sheets and the related securities issued to third party investors are reported as long term debt. under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a worst case scenario, early amortization of investor securities. during the three months ended march 31, 2014, no such triggering events occurred. liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of cash, readily marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, so that we can continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12 month period, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. we have in place a liquidity risk policy that sets out our approach to managing liquidity risk on an enterprise wide basis. we incur and accept liquidity risk arising in the normal course of offering our products and services. the liquidity risks that we are exposed to can arise from a variety of sources, and thus our liquidity management strategy includes a variety of parameters, assessments and guidelines, including, but not limited to maintaining a diversified set of funding sources refer to funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources and projecting cash inflows and outflows from a variety of sources and under a variety of scenarios, including collateral requirements for derivative transactions. 52 table of contents our current liquidity target is to have adequate liquidity in the form of excess cash and readily marketable securities that are easily convertible into cash to satisfy all maturing long term funding obligations for a 12 month period. in addition to our cash and readily marketable securities, we maintain a variety of contingent liquidity resources, such as access to undrawn amounts under our secured borrowing facilities, committed bank credit facilities and the federal reserve discount window. as of march 31, 2014, we had 15.5 billion in excess cash available to fund long term maturities, which includes 20.7 billion classified as cash and cash equivalents and 0.6 billion restricted cash to fund asset backed securitization maturities, less 5.8 billion of cash available to fund day to day operations. the 15.5 billion represents cash residing in the u.s. the upcoming approximate maturities of our long term unsecured debt issued in connection with asset backed securitizations and long term certificates of deposit are as follows table 21 debt maturities billions debt maturities quarter ending unsecureddebt asset backedsecuritizations certificatesof deposit total june 30, 2014 2.1 1.0 0.5 3.6 september 30, 2014 1.5 2.5 0.5 4.5 december

business needs, including changes in outstanding card member loans and receivables and acquisition activities. we consider various factors in determining the amount of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources, and regulatory and credit rating agency considerations. the yield we receive on our cash and readily marketable securities is, generally, less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. thus, we incur substantial net interest costs on these amounts. the level of net interest costs will be dependent on the size of our cash and readily marketable securities holdings, as well as the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. securitized borrowing capacity as of march 31, 2014, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of july 15, 2016, that gives us the right to sell up to 3.0 billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust . we also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of september 15, 2015, that gives us the right to sell up to 2.0 billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the american express credit account master trust the lending trust . both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. as of march 31, 2014, no amounts were drawn on the charge trust facility or the lending trust facility. 53 table of contents federal reserve discount window as insured depository institutions, the banks may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge. the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral, remain at the discretion of the federal reserve. we had approximately 47.9 billion as of march 31, 2014 in u.s. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our existing securitization trusts, or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. committed bank credit facilities in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section, we maintained committed syndicated bank credit facilities as of march 31, 2014, of 7.2 billion. on april 23, 2014, we replaced our 3.0 billion committed bank credit facility expiring in 2015 with a new 3.0 billion committed bank credit facility expiring in 2017. giving effect to this new facility, our committed bank credit facilities expire as follows table 22 expiration of committed syndicated bank credit facilities billions 2015 1.9 2016 2.3 2017 3.0 total 7.2 cash flows cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for i non cash items included in net income, including provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, and stock based compensation and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of various payments. for the three months ended march 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of 3.3 billion decreased 4.2 billion compared to 7.5 billion for the three months ended march 31, 2013, primarily due to changes in accounts payable and other liabilities partially offset by an increase in other assets and net income. cash flows from investing activities our investing activities primarily include funding card member loans and receivables and our available for sale investment portfolio. for the three months ended march 31, 2014, net cash provided by investing activities of 1.6 billion increased 1.5 billion compared to 32 million for the three months ended march 31, 2013, primarily due to a larger decrease in card member loans and receivables and restricted cash as well as a decrease in purchase of investments. 54 table of contents cash flows from financing activities our financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt, taking customer deposits, issuing and repurchasing our common shares, and paying dividends. for the three months ended march 31, 2014, net cash used in financing activities of 3.6 billion increased 1.8 billion compared to 1.8 billion for the three months ended march 31, 2013, due to a decrease in short term borrowings and customer deposits as well as higher principal payments on long term debt, partially offset by higher issuances of long term debt. certain other off balance sheet arrangements as of march 31, 2014, we had approximately 271 billion of unused credit available to card members as part of established lending product agreements. total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. our charge card products generally have no pre set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members. 55 table of contents other reporting matters certain legislative, regulatory and other developments as a participant in the financial services industry, and as a bank holding company, we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the federal reserve and to a range of laws and regulations that impact our business and operations. in light of legislative initiatives over the last several years and continuing regulatory reform implementation, compliance requirements and expenditures have risen for financial services firms, including us, and we expect compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise in the future. dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. among other matters, the law created an independent consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb , which has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws. moreover, the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws for providers of consumer financial products and services, including american express company and certain of our subsidiaries. the cfpb is directed to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. the review of products and practices to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the cfpb and banking regulators more broadly, as well as our own internal reviews. internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our practices, products and procedures. such reviews are also likely to continue to result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, and additional restitution to our card members and may result in additional regulatory actions, including civil money penalties. in december 2013, we announced that certain of our subsidiaries reached settlements with several banking regulators, including the cfpb, to resolve regulatory reviews of marketing and billing practices related to several credit card add on products. for a description of these settlements, see legal proceedings in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2013. in october 2012, we announced that american express company and certain of our subsidiaries reached settlements with several bank regulators, including the cfpb, relating to certain aspects of our u.s. consumer card practices, which requires us to undertake certain actions that will continue in 2014. for a description of these settlements, see legal proceedings in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2012. dodd frank prohibits payment card networks from restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to customers to pay with particular forms of payment, such as cash, check, credit or debit card, or restricting merchants from setting certain minimum, and for certain merchants maximum, transaction amounts for credit cards, as long as any such discounts or incentives or any minimum or maximum transaction amounts do not discriminate on the basis of the issuer or network and comply with applicable federal or state disclosure requirements. 56 table of contents under dodd frank, the federal reserve is also authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to financial institutions on debit card and certain general use prepaid card transactions to ensure that they are reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing individual transactions, and to prohibit payment card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network or fewer than two unaffiliated networks. the federal reserve s rule provides that the regulations on interchange and routing do not apply to a three party network like american express when it acts as both the issuer and the network for prepaid cards, and we are therefore not a payment card network as that term is defined and used for the specific purposes of the rule. dodd frank also authorizes the federal reserve to establish enhanced prudential regulatory requirements, including capital, leverage and liquidity standards, risk management requirements, concentration limits on credit exposures, mandatory resolution plans so called living wills and stress tests for, among others, large bank holding companies, such as american express company, that have greater than 50 billion in assets. we are also required to develop and maintain a capital plan, and to submit the capital plan to the federal reserve for our quantitative and qualitative review under the federal reserve s ccar process. in addition, certain derivative transactions are now required to be centrally cleared, which have increased our collateral posting requirements. many provisions of dodd frank require the adoption of additional rules or regulatory guidance for complete implementation. in addition, dodd frank mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. accordingly, the ultimate consequences of dodd frank and its implementing regulations on our business, results of operations and financial condition continues to be uncertain at this time. department of justice litigation the u.s. department of justice doj and certain states attorneys general have brought an action against us alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against our card products at the point of sale violate the u.s. antitrust laws. see item 1. legal proceedings in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2013 for descriptions of the doj action and related cases. visa and mastercard, which were also defendants in the doj and state action, entered into a settlement agreement and have been dismissed as parties pursuant to that agreement. the settlement enjoins visa and mastercard, with certain exceptions, from adopting or enforcing rules or entering into contracts that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to steer cardholders to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale. if similar conditions were imposed on american express, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. other legislative and regulatory initiatives the payment card sector also faces continuing scrutiny in connection with the fees merchants pay to accept cards and terms of merchant rules and contracts. regulators and legislators outside the u.s. have focused on the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in four party payment networks, like visa and mastercard . although, unlike the visa and mastercard networks, the american express three party payment network does not have interchange fees or collectively set any fees, antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could affect all networks. 57 table of contents in january 2012, the european commission the commission published a green paper a document to begin a process of consultation toward potential regulation covering a range of issues affecting the payments industry. the commission completed the consultation process and on july 24, 2013, issued its recommendations, which included draft legislation now under consideration within the council of the european union and the european parliament. the commission s recommendations included a number of proposals that would likely have significant impact across the industry and would apply either in whole or in part to american express. the proposed changes include price caps the commission proposed capping interchange fees at 20 basis points for debit and prepaid cards and 30 basis points for credit and charge cards. although american express does not have interchange fees, as four party networks such as visa and mastercard have, the caps would be deemed to apply to elements of the financial arrangements agreed between american express and each gns partner in the european union the eu . the discount rates american express agrees with merchants would not be capped, but the interchange caps could exert downward pressures on merchant fees across the industry, including american express discount rates. the commission proposed to exclude commercial card transactions generally from the scope of these caps. network rules on card acceptance the commission proposed to prohibit honor all cards and anti steering rules across all card networks. in addition, the draft proposals sought harmonization of surcharging rules so that, across the eu, transactions that are subject to the interchange caps may not be surcharged, but transactions falling outside the scope of the caps could be surcharged up to cost. network licensing the commission proposed to require all networks, including three party payment networks that operate with licensing arrangements, which would include our gns business, to establish objective, proportionate and non discriminatory criteria under which a financial institution could qualify to be licensed to operate on the network. in addition, the scope of network licenses would be required to cover the entire eu. these requirements are inconsistent with the flexibility and discretion that american express has had to date in deciding when, where and with whom to grant a license in the gns business. separation of network processing the commission proposed to require card networks to separate their network processing functions in which transactions between different issuers and acquirers are processed for authorization, clearing and settlement . this proposal does not apply to three party payment networks, such as american express, but may be deemed applicable in situations where a different gns issuer and acquirer is involved in a transaction, which represent a very small percentage of transactions on the american express network. further clarification of the applicability of this requirement is needed where, as with gns, licensing arrangements do not give rise to inter bank transactions or relationships. these proposals are currently subject to debate and amendment by the european parliament and council of the european union in a complex legislative process that will also involve the commission. the parliament held a preliminary vote in april 2014 broadly in favor of the commission s proposals with some amendments, including the application of price caps to transactions on three party networks above an unspecified share threshold and three party network cards issued with co brand partners or via agents the inclusion of commercial cards within the scope of price caps and the ability of member states to ban surcharging altogether. the council has yet to establish its position on the proposals and the parliament will need to finalize its position in another vote, before the commission, parliament and council ultimately agree on a compromise text. it is therefore too early to assess the exact scope and impact of any final legislation. 58 table of contents in certain countries, such as australia, and in certain member states in the eu, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions, the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it, and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants. surcharging, particularly where it disproportionately impacts american express card members, which is known as differential surcharging, could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread. the reserve bank of australia changed the australian surcharging standards beginning march 18, 2013 to allow us and other networks to limit a merchant s right to surcharge to the reasonable cost of card acceptance. in the eu, the consumer rights directive prohibits merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the merchants cost of acceptance in those member states that permit surcharging. although neither a legislative nor regulatory initiative, the settlement by mastercard and visa in a u.s. merchant class litigation required, among other things, mastercard and visa to permit u.s. merchants, subject to certain conditions, to surcharge credit cards, while allowing them to continue to prohibit surcharges on debit and prepaid card transactions. in december 2013, we announced the proposed settlement of a number of u.s. merchant class action lawsuits, which, if approved, would change certain surcharging provisions in our u.s. card acceptance agreements. for a further description of the proposed settlement, see item 1. legal proceedings in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2013. also, other countries in which we operate have been considering and in some cases adopting similar legislation and rules that would impose changes on certain practices of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks. governments in several countries have established or are proposing to establish payment system regulatory regimes. broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can include rules regarding fees involved in the operation of card networks and, in some cases, requirements for international card networks to be locally licensed and or to localize aspects of their operations. the development and enforcement of regulatory regimes may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global network. refer to consolidated capital resources and liquidity for a

of deferred card fees, net of direct acquisition costs of card member loans and certain other immaterial items. adjusted net interest income represents net interest income attributable to our card member loans portfolio excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our card member loans portfolio. asset securitizations asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of receivables or loans to a special purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. the trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, that are secured by the transferred receivables or loans. the trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying receivables or loans. the receivables and loans of our charge trust and lending trust being securitized are reported as assets on our consolidated balance sheets. average discount rate this calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose american express cards. it represents the percentage of billed business both proprietary and gns retained by us from merchants we acquire,

as well as any card related fees. charge cards represents cards that generally carry no pre set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. charge card members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. no finance charges are assessed on charge cards. each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a customer s most recent credit information and spend patterns. some charge card accounts have an additional lending on charge feature that allows revolving certain balances.

contra revenue items. 60 table of contents four party network a payment network, such as visa or mastercard, in which the card issuer and merchant acquirer are different entities and the network does not have direct relationships with merchants or cardholders. interest expense interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund card member loans, charge card product receivables, general corporate purposes, and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. interest expense is divided principally into two categories i deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions and ii long term debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long term financing and short term borrowings, which primarily relates to interest expense on commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short term borrowings. interest income interest income includes i interest on loans, ii interest and dividends on investment securities and iii interest income on deposits with banks and other. interest on loans is assessed using the average daily balance method for loans. unless the loan is classified as non accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relates to our performing fixed income securities. interest income is accrued as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that the related investment security recognizes a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance throughout its term. these amounts are recognized until these securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. interest income on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near term funding requirements in interest bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest bearing demand and call accounts. merchant acquisition represents the signing of merchants to accept american express branded cards. net card fees represents the card membership fees earned during the period. these fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period typically one year , net of provision for projected refunds for cancellation of card membership. net interest yield on card
