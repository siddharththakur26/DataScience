NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS







Note 1  -  
The financial statements included in this report reflect all normal and recurring
adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation
of the Corporation’s consolidated financial position at September 30, 2004 and December
31, 2003, the consolidated results of operations for the three- and nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 and the consolidated cash flows for the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2004 and 2003. The unaudited results of operations for the
interim periods reported are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for
the full year.
Certain notes and other information have been condensed or omitted from these interim
financial statements. These statements, therefore, should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the 2003 Annual
Report to Stockholders, which have been incorporated by reference in the Corporation’s
Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 2003.









Note 2  -  
In the first quarter of 2003, the Corporation exchanged crude oil producing properties
in Colombia (acquired in 2001 as part of the Triton acquisition), plus $10 million in
cash, for an additional 25% interest in natural gas reserves in a non-producing
property under development in the joint development area of Malaysia and Thailand. In
the second quarter of 2003, the Corporation sold producing properties in the Gulf of
Mexico shelf, the Jabung Field in Indonesia and several small United Kingdom fields for
$445 million. After tax income from these discontinued operations was $53 million for
the first nine months of 2003. The net gain from asset sales from discontinued
operations was $116 million for the same period.
Income from discontinued operations of $7 million in the first nine months of 2004
reflects the settlement of a previously accrued contingency relating to a foreign
exploration and production operation that was disposed of in 2003.

Note 10 -  
The Corporation records compensation expense for nonvested common stock awards (restricted stock) ratably over the vesting
period, which is generally three to five years. The Corporation uses the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock
options. Because the exercise prices of employee stock options equal or exceed the market price of the stock on the date of
grant, the Corporation does not recognize compensation expense.
The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options for pro forma disclosure.
Using the fair value method, stock option expense would be recognized over the one- to three-year vesting periods. The
following pro forma financial information presents the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the Corporation used
the fair value method (in millions, except per share data):

The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in other
comprehensive income to earnings at the time the hedged transactions
are recognized. Hedging decreased exploration and production results
by $180 million ($288 million before income taxes) in the third quarter
of 2004 and $377 million ($604 million before income taxes) in the
first nine months of 2004. Hedging decreased exploration and
production results by $54 million ($87 million before income taxes) in
the third quarter of 2003 and $201 million ($321 million before income
taxes) in the first nine months of 2003.


 


 
 
 
At September 30, 2004, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
included after-tax deferred losses of $1,047 million ($205 million of
realized losses and $842 million of unrealized losses) related to crude
oil and natural gas contracts used as hedges of exploration and
production sales. Realized losses in accumulated other comprehensive
income represent losses on closed contracts that are deferred until the
underlying barrels are sold. Approximately $80 million of the realized
loss will reduce fourth quarter earnings and the remainder will be
recognized in 2005. The pre-tax amount of the hedge losses is
reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are
recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.


 


 
 
 
In its energy marketing business, the Corporation has entered into cash
flow hedges to fix the purchase prices of natural gas, heating oil,
residual fuel oil and electricity related to contracted future sales.
At September 30, 2004, the net after-tax deferred gain in accumulated
other comprehensive income from these hedge contracts was $43 million.









Note 12 -  
In the first quarter of 2004, the Corporation guaranteed its share
of an investee’s borrowings to finance construction of an oil pipeline.
The amount guaranteed at September 30, 2004 is approximately $43 million.
The guarantee will be in place through the end of pipeline construction,
which the Corporation expects to be in 2006.

Note 14 —  
On January 1, 2003, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations as required by
FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Using the accounting method required by FAS No. 143, the
Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations associated with
long-lived assets in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred. The Corporation capitalizes the
associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. The cumulative effect of
this change in the first nine months of 2003 was a credit to income of $7 million or $.08 per share, basic and diluted.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition.
Overview
     Net income was $178 million for the third quarter of 2004,
including $155 million from exploration and production operations
and $85 million from refining and marketing activities.



     Worldwide oil and gas production averaged 323,000 barrels of
oil equivalent per day during the third quarter of 2004 and
340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the first nine
months of the year. In the third quarter, production was lower
than in the first half of the year, primarily because of normal
North Sea facilities maintenance. The Corporation anticipates
that full-year 2004 production will average 340,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day. In the third quarter of 2004, the
Corporation’s average crude oil selling price was $26.59 per
barrel, including the effects of hedging (see discussion of
selling prices on page 13).



     In August, the government of Equatorial Guinea approved the
Plan of Development for Northern Block G. The Corporation is
currently awarding many of the major contracts on this development
and expects first production in early 2007.



     On Block A-18 in the Malaysia-Thailand joint development
area, the Corporation anticipates first production early in 2005.
The Corporation expects to reach the full contracted rate of 160
million cubic feet per day, net, by the end of 2005, following
completion of the buyers’ gas separation plant, which is being
constructed onshore Thailand. Negotiations with the buyers
regarding additional gas sales are at an advanced stage.



     In Libya, the Corporation and its partners are in the final
stages of negotiations with the Libyan National Oil Company on
terms of reentry into our former operations in the country.



Results of Operations
     Net income for the third quarter of 2004 amounted to $178
million, compared with $146 million in the third quarter of 2003.
Net income for the first nine months of 2004 was $748 million
compared with $574 million in the first nine months of 2003,
including $7 million and $169 million, respectively, from
discontinued operations. The after-tax results by major operating
activity for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2004
and 2003 were as follows (in millions, except per share data):

Comparison of Results
     In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain
transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews
segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in
its analysis of variances in segment earnings. Management believes
that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances
in earnings, since they show the entire effect of transactions rather
than only the pre-tax amounts. After-tax amounts are determined by
applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to
pre-tax amounts.



Exploration and Production
     Exploration and production earnings from continuing operations
increased by $31 million in the third quarter and $213 million in the
first nine months of 2004 compared with the corresponding periods of
2003. Earnings in the third quarter of 2003 include $30 million of
United States income tax benefits relating to foreign exploration
activities. Earnings for the first nine months of 2004 and 2003
include after-tax gains on asset sales of $33 million ($23 million
before income taxes) and $31 million ($47 million before income
taxes), respectively. Earnings for the first nine months of 2004 and
2003 also include after-tax charges of $9 million and $23 million ($15
million and $38 million before income taxes), respectively, for
accrued severance and a reduction in leased office space in London.



     After considering the gains on asset sales and other items
described above, the remaining changes in exploration and production
earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices,
sales volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses, as
discussed below.

     Selling prices: Higher average selling prices of crude oil and
natural gas increased exploration and production revenues by
approximately $142 million in the third quarter and $295 million in
the first nine months of 2004 compared with the same periods of 2003.
The Corporation’s average selling prices, including the effects of
hedging, were as follows:

     The after-tax impacts of crude oil and U.S. natural gas hedges
were opportunity costs of $180 million in the third quarter and $377
million in the first nine months of 2004 compared with opportunity
costs of $54 million and $201 million in the same periods of the prior
year.



     The Corporation has after-tax deferred hedge losses of $1,047
million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Of this
amount, $842 million is unrealized and relates to open hedge
positions. The remaining $205 million deferred loss is realized and
relates to closed hedge positions. The deferred realized loss will be
recognized in earnings as the underlying barrels are sold.



     The Corporation has open hedge positions equal to 70% of its
estimated worldwide crude oil production for the fourth quarter of
2004 and 60% of its estimated worldwide crude oil production for 2005.
The average price for United States crude oil open hedge positions is
$37.12 in 2004 and $31.24 in 2005. The average price for foreign
crude oil open hedge positions is $32.14 in 2004 and $29.49 in 2005.
In addition to the gains or losses on these open hedge positions,
approximately $80 million of the $205 million deferred realized loss
will reduce fourth quarter earnings and the remaining deferred
realized loss will be recognized in 2005.



     Production and sales volumes: The Corporation’s oil and gas
production, on a barrel of oil equivalent basis, was 323,000 barrels
per day in the third quarter of 2004 compared with 339,000 barrels per
day in the third quarter of 2003. The decrease results primarily from
natural field decline and increased maintenance. The Corporation’s
oil and gas production in the first nine months of 2004 decreased to


13



Table of Contents

PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
Results of Operations (Continued)
340,000 barrels per day from 378,000 barrels per day in 2003. This
decline was primarily due to asset sales and exchanges in 2003 and
natural field decline. The Corporation anticipates that its average
production for the full year of 2004 will be approximately 340,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Corporation’s net daily
worldwide production was as follows (in thousands):

     The changes in crude oil and natural gas sales volumes in 2004
compared to the same periods of 2003 resulted in lower income before
income taxes of approximately $85 million for the third quarter and
$105 million for the first nine months of 2004 compared with the
corresponding periods of 2003.

Results of Operations (Continued)
     Operating costs and exploration expenses: Operating costs and
exploration expenses from continuing operations decreased by
approximately $18 million in the third quarter of 2004 compared with
the corresponding period in the prior year. Depreciation, depletion
and amortization charges were lower in the third quarter of 2004
compared with 2003, reflecting lower production volumes and lower unit
cost per barrel. Production expenses decreased slightly in the third
quarter of 2004; however, on a barrel of oil equivalent basis, unit
lifting costs per barrel increased.



     For the first nine months of 2004 compared with the same period
of 2003, operating costs and exploration expenses from continuing
operations decreased by approximately $130 million. Exploratory
drilling was lower in the first nine months of 2004; however, a larger
portion of the annual drilling program is scheduled for the fourth
quarter. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were also
lower in the first nine months of 2004 compared with 2003, reflecting
lower production volumes and lower unit cost per barrel from changes
in the mix of producing fields.



     Other: Foreign currency translation resulted in pre-tax gains of
$9 million in the third quarter of 2004 and $11 million in the first
nine months of 2004 compared with gains of $2 million and losses of
$15 million in the corresponding periods of 2003. Foreign currency
gains or losses are included in non-operating income (expense) in the
income statement.



     The effective income tax rate for exploration and production
operations in the first nine months of 2004 was 46% compared to 52% in
the first nine months of 2003.



     The Corporation’s future exploration and production earnings may
be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling
prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes
and changes in tax rates.



Refining and Marketing
     Earnings from refining and marketing activities amounted to $85
million in the third quarter of 2004 compared with $89 million in the
corresponding period of 2003. For the first nine months of 2004,
refining and marketing operations earned $358 million compared with
$272 million in 2003. The first nine months of 2003 includes an
after-tax loss on the sale of the Corporation’s interest in a shipping
joint venture of $20 million ($9 million before income taxes).



     The Corporation’s downstream operations include HOVENSA L.L.C.
(HOVENSA), a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), accounted for on the equity
method. Additional refining and marketing activities include a fluid
catalytic cracking facility in Port Reading, New Jersey, as well as
retail gasoline stations, energy marketing and trading

operations. In
the second quarter of 2004, the Corporation invested in a joint
venture, Hess LNG L.L.C., to pursue investments in liquified natural
gas terminals and related supply, trading and marketing opportunities.



     HOVENSA: The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income, before
income taxes, was $75 million in the third quarter of 2004 compared
with $43 million in the third quarter of 2003. For the first nine
months of 2004, the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income was $223
million compared with $108 million for the first nine months of 2003.
HOVENSA’s total crude runs amounted to 488,000 barrels per day in
the first nine months of 2004 and 436,000 barrels per day in the
first nine months of 2003. In the early part of 2003, crude runs
were reduced reflecting interruptions in crude oil deliveries from
Venezuela. During the third quarter of 2004, the Corporation
received a cash distribution of $88 million from HOVENSA.



     In the third quarter and first nine months of 2004, the
Corporation recorded deferred income tax expense in refining and
marketing results of $18 million and $29 million, respectively,
relating to HOVENSA’s earnings. The Corporation anticipates that for
the remainder of the year deferred taxes will be provided on HOVENSA
earnings at a rate of approximately 20% to 25%. In 2005, the
Corporation expects that deferred taxes will be recorded at the
Virgin Islands statutory rate of 38.5%. As of September 30, the
Corporation has approximately $200 million of net operating loss
carryforwards available to offset its share of future HOVENSA taxable
income.



     Earnings from refining and marketing activities also include
interest income on the note received from PDVSA at the formation of
the joint venture. Interest on the PDVSA note amounted to $19 million
in the first nine months of 2004 and $23 million in the same period of
2003. Interest income is recorded in non-operating income in the
income statement.



     Retail, Energy Marketing and Other: Results of retail gasoline
operations were lower in the third quarter and first nine months of
2004 compared with the corresponding periods of 2003 reflecting lower
gasoline margins, although sales volumes increased. Energy marketing
earnings were also lower in the third quarter and first nine months of
2004 due to decreased margins compared with 2003. Results of the Port
Reading refining facility were lower in the third quarter of 2004 than
in the same period of the prior year, but higher in the first nine
months of 2004 reflecting changes in margins in each period and a
storm related shutdown for 25 days in the third quarter of 2004.
Refined product sales volumes were 394,000 barrels per day in the
third quarter of 2004 and 427,000 barrels per day in the first nine
months of 2004, compared with 390,000 and 417,000 barrels per day in
the corresponding periods of 2003.



     The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated
partnership that trades energy commodities and derivatives. The
Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The
Corporation’s after-tax results from trading

activities, including its
share of the earnings of the trading partnership amounted to income of
$11 million ($18 million before income taxes) in the third quarter and
$44 million ($75 million before income taxes) in the first nine months
of 2004. Trading activities resulted in income of $3 million ($8
million before income taxes) in the third quarter and $15 million ($26
million before income taxes) in the first nine months of 2003.



     Marketing expenses increased in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2004, compared with the corresponding periods of the prior
year. The increases include employee costs relating to new
convenience stores, repairs of storm related damage and increased
compensation costs resulting from higher earnings of the trading
partnership.



     Refining and marketing earnings will likely continue to be
volatile reflecting competitive industry conditions and supply and
demand factors, including the effects of weather.



Corporate
     After-tax corporate expenses amounted to $23 million in the third
quarter and $49 million in the first nine months of 2004 compared with
$25 million and $73 million in the same periods of 2003. The third
quarter 2004 amount includes $7 million after tax ($10 million before
tax) from incremental pension and benefit costs. The results for the
first nine months of 2004 include a non-cash income tax benefit of $13
million resulting from the completion of a prior year United States
income tax audit. Corporate expenses in the first nine months of 2003
include after-tax charges of $15 million ($27 million before income
taxes) from early repayment of debt.



Interest Expense
     After-tax interest totaled $39 million in the third quarter of
2004 compared with $42 million in the third quarter of 2003. In the
first nine months of 2004, after-tax interest amounted to $112 million
compared with $132 million in the first nine months of 2003. The
corresponding amounts before income taxes were $62 million in the
third quarter of 2004, $73 million in the third quarter of 2003, $179
million in the first nine months of 2004 and $224 million in the first
nine months of 2003. Interest expense in 2004 was lower than in 2003
due to lower average outstanding debt and higher capitalized interest.
Capitalized interest was $41 million in the first nine months of 2004
and $31 million in the first nine months of 2003.



Discontinued Operations
     Income from discontinued operations of $7 million in the first
nine months of 2004 reflects the settlement of a previously accrued
contingency relating to a foreign exploration and production operation
that was disposed of in 2003.

Results of Operations (Continued)
     In the first quarter of 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude oil
producing properties in Colombia (acquired in 2001 as part of the
Triton acquisition), plus $10 million in cash, for an additional 25%
interest in Block A-18 in the joint development area of Malaysia and
Thailand (JDA). The exchange resulted in an after-tax charge to
income of $59 million in discontinued operations in the first quarter
of 2003. In the second quarter of 2003, the Corporation sold Gulf of
Mexico Shelf properties, the Jabung Field in Indonesia and several
small United Kingdom fields for $445 million. An after-tax gain from
these asset sales of $175 million was included in discontinued
operations. Discontinued operations in first nine months of 2003 also
include $53 million of income from operations prior to the sales of
these assets.



Sales and Other Operating Revenues
     Sales and other operating revenues increased by 19% in the third
quarter and 13% in the first nine months of 2004 compared with the
corresponding periods of 2003. This increase principally reflects
higher selling prices and sales volumes of refined products, partially
offset by decreased sales of purchased natural gas in energy
marketing. The
increase in cost of goods sold also reflects the change in sales
volumes of refined products.



Liquidity and Capital Resources
     Overview: Cash flows from operating activities in the first nine
months of 2004 totaled $1,649 million, including changes in operating
assets and liabilities of $377 million. Cash and short-term
investments at September 30, 2004 totaled $1,056 million, an increase
of $538 million from year-end. At September 30, 2004, the
Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio was 42.2% compared to 42.5%
at December 31, 2003. Total debt was $3,836 million at September 30,
2004 and $3,941 million at December 31, 2003.



     Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Net cash provided by
operating activities, including changes in operating assets and
liabilities, totaled $1,649 million in the first nine months of 2004
compared with $1,159 million in the first nine months of 2003. This
change is primarily due to higher earnings and the timing of cash
flows associated with changes in operating assets and liabilities,
principally working capital accounts. Operating assets and
liabilities increased $377 million in 2004 and decreased $232 million
in 2003. During the third quarter of 2004, the Corporation received a
cash distribution of $88 million from HOVENSA.



     Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Capital expenditures in
the first nine months of 2004 were $1,092 million of which $1,047
million related to exploration and production activities. Capital
expenditures in the same period of 2003 were $1,015 million, including
$958 million for exploration and production. Proceeds from asset and
investment sales totaled $53 million in 2004 and $525 million in 2003.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)
     Cash Flows from Financing Activities: The Corporation reduced
debt by $106 million during the first nine months of 2004. Debt
reduction in the first nine months of 2003 was $502 million.
Dividends paid were $145 million in the first nine months of 2004
compared with $108 million in the same period of the prior year. The
increase was due to dividends on the 7% preferred stock issued in the
fourth quarter of 2003. During the first nine months of 2004, the
Corporation received proceeds from the exercise of stock options
totaling $85 million.



     Future Capital Requirements and Resources: Capital expenditures
excluding acquisitions, if any, for the remainder of 2004 are
currently estimated to be approximately $450 million. The Corporation
anticipates that available cash and cash flow from operations will
fund these expenditures.



     At September 30, 2004, the Corporation had a $1.5 billion credit
facility under its committed revolving credit agreement. During the
third quarter, the Corporation entered into an amendment of this
agreement that permits the Corporation to request the issuance of
letters of credit up to $1.5 billion. The Corporation’s revolving
credit agreement expires in 2006; however, the Corporation anticipates
that it will enter into a new committed facility before the existing
facility expires. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under
which it may issue $825 million of additional debt securities,
warrants, common stock or preferred stock.



     With higher crude oil prices, the Corporation’s collateral
requirements under certain contracts with hedging and trading
counterparties have increased. The Corporation used letters of credit
from the credit facility and uncommitted lines to meet these
collateral requirements. Outstanding letters of credit increased to
$1,627 million at September 30, 2004 compared with $229 million at
December 31, 2003. At September 30, the Corporation has used $762
million of the $1.5 billion facility for letters of credit. The
amount of the credit line remaining is $738 million.



     Loan agreement covenants allow the Corporation to borrow an
additional $4.9 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets
at September 30, 2004. At September 30, 2004, the maximum amount of
dividends that can be paid from borrowings under the loan agreements
is $1.8 billion.



     Prior to June 30, 1986, the Corporation had extensive exploration
and production operations in Libya; however, U.S. Government sanctions
required suspension of participation in these operations. The
Corporation wrote off the book value of its Libyan assets in
connection with the cessation of operations. On February 24, 2004,
the Corporation received U.S. Government authorization to negotiate
and enter into an executory agreement with the government of Libya
that would define the terms for resuming active participation in the
Libyan properties. On April 29, 2004, the U.S. Government lifted most
of the sanctions imposed on Libya. It has also taken the necessary
steps to have the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1976 terminated by
Congress with respect to Libya. As a result, the Corporation

and its
partners will be able to resume operations in Libya if they are able
to reach a successful conclusion to ongoing commercial negotiations.
If these negotiations are successful, management anticipates capital
expenditures will likely increase over the current plan.



     In the fourth quarter of 2004, the President signed the American
Jobs Creation Act (the Act), which will allow corporations to
repatriate foreign earnings at an effective income tax rate of 5.25%.
The Corporation is evaluating the repatriation provisions of the Act.
The maximum amount that the Corporation could repatriate under the Act
is $1.9 billion. The Corporation has not determined the amount, if
any, of such repatriation. A repatriation of earnings would result in
an additional income tax charge on the amount remitted.



     Credit Ratings: In the first quarter of 2004, two credit rating
agencies downgraded their ratings of the Corporation’s debt. One of
the revised ratings was below investment grade. If an additional
rating agency were to reduce its credit rating below investment grade,
the incremental margin requirements at September 30, 2004 would be
approximately $30 million.



     Other: In connection with the sale of six vessels in 2002, the
Corporation agreed to support the buyer’s charter rate on these
vessels for up to five years. The support agreement requires that if
the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is less than
the stipulated support rate in the agreement, the Corporation will pay
to the buyer the difference between the contracted rate and the
stipulated rate. The balance in the charter support reserve at January
1, 2004 was $32 million. During the first nine months of 2004, the
Corporation made net payments of $3 million for charter support,
reducing the reserve to $29 million.



     At December 31, 2003, the Corporation had an accrual of $38
million for severance and leased office space in London. During the
first nine months of 2004, $15 million of additional pre-tax costs
were accrued and $16 million of payments were made. The September 30,
2004 accrual for severance and office lease costs is $37 million.
Additional accruals for lease costs of approximately $20 million
before income taxes are anticipated in 2005.



     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Corporation has leveraged
leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail
gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present
value of these leases is $464 million at September 30, 2004. The
Corporation’s September 30, 2004 debt to capitalization ratio would
increase from 42.2% to 45.0% if the leases were included as debt.



     The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSA’s
crude oil and feedstock purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA.
The amount of the Corporation’s guarantee fluctuates based on the
volume of crude oil purchased and related prices. At September 30,
2004, the guarantee totaled $220 million. In addition, the
Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $40

million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior
debt obligations.



     In the first quarter of 2004, the Corporation guaranteed its
share of an investee’s borrowings to finance construction of an oil
pipeline. The amount guaranteed is approximately $43 million. The
guarantee will be in place through the end of the pipeline’s
construction, which the Corporation expects to be in 2006.



Market Risk Disclosure
     In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed
to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil,
natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes
in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures
that follow, these operations are referred to as non-trading
activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally
through a 50% voting interest in a trading partnership. These
activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to
the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products.



     Instruments: The Corporation uses forward commodity contracts,
foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps and options in the
Corporation’s non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are
widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms.



     Quantitative Measures: The Corporation uses value-at-risk and
other limits to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading
and non-trading activities. The value-at-risk model uses historical
simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value
over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first
and second order sensitivities for options. The potential change in
fair value based on commodity price risk is presented in the
non-trading and trading sections below.



     Non-Trading: The Corporation’s non-trading activities include
hedging of crude oil and natural gas production. Futures and swaps
are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the Corporation’s
future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part
of the Corporation’s selling prices. As of September 30, the
Corporation has open hedge positions equal to 70% of its estimated
worldwide crude oil production for the period from October 1 to
December 31, 2004 and 60% of its estimated 2005 worldwide crude oil
production. The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil
(WTI) related open hedge positions is $37.12 in 2004 and $31.24 in
2005. The average price for Brent crude oil related open hedge
positions is $32.14 in 2004 and $29.49 in 2005. Approximately 20% of
the Corporation’s hedges are WTI related and the remainder is Brent.
In addition, the Corporation has 24,000 barrels per day of Brent
related crude oil production hedged from 2006 through 2012 at an
average price of $26.20 per barrel. As market conditions change, the
Corporation may adjust its hedge percentages.

PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
Market Risk Disclosure (Continued)
     Because the selling price of crude oil has increased since the
beginning of the year, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
at September 30, 2004 includes after-tax deferred losses of $1,047
million ($205 million of realized losses and $842 million of
unrealized losses) related to crude oil and natural gas contracts used
as hedges of exploration and production sales. Realized losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income represent losses on closed
contracts that are deferred until the underlying barrels are sold.
Approximately $80 million of the realized loss will reduce fourth
quarter earnings and the remainder will be recognized in 2005. The
pre-tax amount of all deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts
payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred
tax assets on the balance sheet.



     The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined
petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses
futures and swaps to fix the purchase prices of commodities to be sold
under fixed-price sales contracts.



     The Corporation estimates that at September 30, 2004, the
value-at-risk for commodity related derivatives that are settled in
cash and used in non-trading activities was $111 million ($44 million
at December 31, 2003). The results may vary from time to time as
hedge levels and oil and gas prices change.



     Trading and Risk Management: The trading partnership in which the
Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy commodities and
derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are consolidated with
those of the Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading
positions for its own account. These strategies are primarily
proprietary position management. The information that follows
represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporation’s
proprietary trading accounts.



     In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in
crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices, primarily in North
America and Europe. Trading positions may include futures, forwards,
swaps and options. In some cases, physical purchase and sale
contracts are used as trading instruments and are included in the
trading results.



     Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at
the time of sale. Derivative trading transactions are marked-to-market
and are reflected in income currently. Total realized gains for the
first nine months of 2004 amounted to $112 million ($35 million of
realized gains for the first nine months of 2003). The following
table provides an assessment of the factors affecting the changes in
fair value of trading activities and represents 100% of the trading
partnership and other trading activities (in millions):

quoted prices are not available, other external sources are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in actively
quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets and other market fundamental analysis. Internal estimates are based on
internal models incorporating underlying market information such as commodity volatilities and correlations. The Corporation’s risk
management department regularly compares valuations to independent sources and models. The sources of fair value at September 30,

value-at-risk for trading activities, including commodities, was $14
million ($7 million at December 31, 2003). The results may change

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1. Legal Proceedings
On or about July 15, 2004, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (“HOVIC”), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Registrant, and HOVENSA L.L.C., in which
Registrant owns a 50% interest, each received a letter from the
Commissioner of the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural
Resources and Natural Resources Trustee, advising of the Trustee’s
intention to bring suit against HOVIC and HOVENSA under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(“CERCLA”). The letter alleges that HOVIC and HOVENSA are potentially
responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of
hazardous substances from the “HOVENSA Oil Refinery.” HOVENSA
currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south shore of
St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands, which had been operated by
HOVIC until October 1998. The letter does not specify the basis for
the claim or a claimed damage amount. If an action is brought,
Registrant and HOVENSA intend to vigorously defend it.

of such Section:



               “(e) The Company agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative

portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
during the period from and including the Amendment Effective Date
to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender’s
Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to
have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting
fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the

the reference to “2.16(d)”.



          (i) Section 2.17(b) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to provide
that the consent of each Issuing Bank is required for any assignment by a
Lender under such Section.



          (j) Article II of the Credit Agreement is hereby further amended to
add the following Section 2.18 at the end thereof:

          “SECTION 2.18. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company, at its option, may
request any Issuing Bank or Issuing Banks to issue for the Company’s
account Letters of Credit denominated in dollars, in form reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Banks,
at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period. In
the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit
application or other agreement submitted by the Company to, or entered
into by the Company with, any Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of
Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. An
Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of
Credit if any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or
arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing
Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law, rule, regulation or
orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to the Issuing Bank or
any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from
any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank shall
prohibit, or request that the Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of
letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or
shall impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit
any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing
Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the
Amendment Effective Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank any
unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the
Amendment Effective Date and which the Issuing Bank in good faith deems
material to it.



          (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the
amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the
Company shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the
applicable Issuing Bank) to an Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent
(reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of
Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or
extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter
of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this
Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of
the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary
to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested
by the Issuing Bank, the Company also shall submit a letter of credit
application on the Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any
request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued,
amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Company shall be
deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such
issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure shall not exceed
$1,500,000,000, (ii) the portion of the LC Exposure attributable to
Letters of Credit issued by any Issuing


5



 




 
 
Bank shall not exceed the LC Commitment of such Issuing Bank and (iii)
the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the total
Commitments. Each Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative
Agent of each issuance, amendment, renewal, extension or expiry of, and
of each drawing under, each Letter of Credit issued by it, and shall
provide to the Administrative Agent such other information as the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the Letters of
Credit issued by such Issuing Bank.


          (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or
prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year
after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the
case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal
or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the
Maturity Date.



          (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and
without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the
Lenders, each Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender
hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter
of Credit equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate
amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In
consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable
Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not
reimbursed by the Company on the date due as provided in paragraph (e)
of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded
to the Company for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that
its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in
respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not
be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment,
renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments,
and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement,
withholding or reduction whatsoever.



          (e) Reimbursement. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Company shall
reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an
amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York
City time, not later than the next Business Day following the date that
such LC Disbursement is made, if the Company shall have received notice
of such LC Disbursement prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
date such LC Disbursement is made, or, if such notice has not been
received by the Company prior to such time on such date, then not later
than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Business Day next following
the date on which the Company receives such notice by such time;
provided that the Company may, subject to the conditions to
borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that
such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing in an
equivalent amount and, to the extent so


6



 




 
 
financed, the Company’s obligation to make such payment shall be
discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing. If
the Company fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative
Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the
payment then due from the Company in respect thereof and such Lender’s
Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such
notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable
Percentage of the payment then due from the Company, in the same manner
as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender
(and Section 2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment
obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly
pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from
the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of
any payment from the Company pursuant to this paragraph, the
Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable
Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant
to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders
and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made
by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse any Issuing Bank for
any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans as
contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve
the Company of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.


          (f) Obligations Absolute. The Company’s obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all
circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or
provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a
Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any
respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or
circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing,
that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal
or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the
Company’s obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the
Lenders nor the Issuing Banks, nor any of their Related Parties, shall
have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with
the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or
failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error,
omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any
draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of
Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder),
any error in
interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from
causes beyond the control of the Issuing Banks; provided that the
foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from
liability to the Company to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed
to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived
by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable


7



 

law) suffered by the Company that are caused by such Issuing Bank’s
failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other
documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms
thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of
gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank
(as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such
determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting
the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to
documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial
compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may,
in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such
documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless
of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and
make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict
compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.



          (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing
Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Company by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and
whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement
thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such
notice shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to reimburse
such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.



          (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Company shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the
unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and
including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the
date that the Company reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per
annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that, if the
Company fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.11(d) shall apply.
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of
the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after
the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such
Lender to the extent of such payment.



          (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. Any Issuing Bank may be
replaced at any time by written agreement among the Company, the
Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor
Issuing Bank.
The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such
replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall
become effective, the Company shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the
account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.10(e). From
and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor
Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and


8



 

obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to
Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to
the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to
any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing
Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing
Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and
shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank
under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior
to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional
Letters of Credit.



          (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur
and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Company receives notice
from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the
maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC
Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure)
demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the
Company shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the
name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an
amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued
and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such
cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit
shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice
of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to
the Company described in clause (g) or (h) of Article VII. Each such
deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the
payment and performance of the obligations of the Company under this
Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.
Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which
investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent and at the Company’s risk and expense, such deposits
shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such
investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account
shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing
Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to
the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the
reimbursement obligations of the Company for the LC Exposure at such time
or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the
consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than
50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of
the Company under this Agreement. If the Company is required to provide
an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of
an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three Business
Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.


          (k) The preamble to Article III of the Credit Agreement is hereby
amended to provide that the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in such Article (i) are made to the Issuing Banks, as well as to the
Lenders, and (ii) will be deemed to be made by the Company on each date of
issuance, renewal, extension or


9



 

          increase of a Letter of Credit, as well as on the occasion of each other event
described in such preamble.


          (l) Section 4.02 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to apply to
the obligation of each Issuing Bank to issue, renew, extend or increase the
amount of any Letter of Credit, as well as to the obligation of each Lender to
make a Loan.


          (m) The preambles to Articles V and VI of the Credit Agreement are
hereby amended to provide that the covenants and agreements set forth in such
Articles (i) shall be for the benefit of the Issuing Banks, as well as for
the benefit of the Lenders, and (ii) shall remain in effect, in addition to
being in effect until the occurrence of the other events described in such
preamble, until all Letters of Credit shall have expired or terminated and
all LC Disbursements shall have been reimbursed.


          (n) Section 5.07 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to provide
that Letters of Credit will be used for general corporate requirements of
the Company.


          (o) Paragraph (a) of Article VII of the Credit Agreement is hereby
amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:



               “(a) the Company shall be in default in the payment when
due of any principal of any Loan on the maturity date thereof or
any reimbursement obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement
when and as the same shall become due;”


          (p) Article VIII of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to provide
that each Issuing Bank irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its
agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its
behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative
Agent by the terms of the Credit Agreement, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.


          (q) Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to add the
following paragraph (e) at the end thereof:



               “(e) if to an Issuing Bank, to it at the address most
recently specified by it in a notice delivered to the
Administrative Agent and the Company.”


          (r) The following Section 9.02A is hereby inserted immediately after
Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement:



          (i) “Section 9.02A. Provisions Related to Letters of Credit. No
amendment, modification or waiver of this Agreement or any provision
hereof that would decrease the amount of any LC Disbursement or the rate
of interest thereon shall be effective without the written consent of
each Lender and Issuing Bank. No amendment, modification or waiver of
this Agreement or any provision hereof that would postpone the required
date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement shall be effective without
the written consent of each affected


10



 




 
 
Lender. No amendment, modification or waiver of this Agreement or any
provision hereof that would alter the rights or duties of any Issuing
Bank hereunder shall be effective without the written consent of such
Issuing Bank. After the termination or expiration of Commitments, if no
Loans shall be outstanding, all actions hereunder that would theretofore
have required the consent of the Required Lenders shall require the
consent of Lenders having Revolving Credit Exposures representing at
least 51% of the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure at such time.”


          (s) Section 9.03 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended as
follows:



          (i) Paragraph (b) of such Section is hereby amended to provide
that the Issuing Banks (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall have
rights comparable to the rights of Lenders under such paragraph.



          (ii) Paragraph (c) of such Section is hereby amended to provide
that the Issuing Banks (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall have
rights comparable to the rights of the Administrative Agent under such
paragraph.



          (t) Section 9.04(b) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to provide
that consent of each Issuing Bank shall be required for any assignment by a
Lender thereunder.


          SECTION 2. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and
warrants to each other party hereto that (a) the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Amendment have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action and are within the Company’s corporate power and
that this Amendment has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by general principles of equity and bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and by
moratorium laws from time to time in effect, and (b) after giving effect to
this Amendment (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Article III
of the Credit Agreement are true and correct on and as of the date hereof, and
(ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing.


          SECTION 3. Effectiveness. This Amendment shall become effective as of
the date set forth above on the date that the Administrative Agent or its
counsel shall have received counterparts of this Amendment that, when taken
together, bear the signatures of the Company, the Required Lenders and the
Issuing Banks.


          SECTION 4. Effect of Amendment. Except as expressly set forth herein,
this Amendment shall not by implication or otherwise limit, impair, constitute
a waiver of, or otherwise affect the rights and remedies of the Lenders, the
Syndication Agent or the Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement or
any other Loan Document, and shall not alter, modify, amend or in any way
affect any of the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements
contained in the Credit Agreement or any other



11



 

Loan Document, all of which are ratified and affirmed in all respects and
shall continue in full force and effect. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
entitle the Company to a consent to, or a waiver, amendment, modification or
other change of, any of the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or
agreements contained in the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document in
similar or different circumstances.



          SECTION 5. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in counterparts
(and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which
shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall
constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page of this Amendment by facsimile shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Amendment.


          SECTION 6. Governing Law. This Amendment shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.


          SECTION 7. Headings. The headings of this Amendment are for purposes of
reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.


12



 

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Amendment to be duly executed by their respective authorized

2.
 
Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement

4.
 
The registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as

and have:





 
(a)
 
Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
which this report is being prepared;


 


 
(b)
 
Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure
controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as
of the end of the period covered by this report based on such
evaluation; and


 


 
(c)
 
Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the

registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and


 



 






5.
 
The registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based
on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the

(a)
 
All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information; and


 


 
(b)
 
Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s
internal control over financial reporting.
