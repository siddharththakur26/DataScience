item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the three months ended september 30, 2002 and 2001 summary amr corporation's amr or the company net loss during the third quarter of 2002 was 924 million, or 5.93 per share, as compared to a net loss of 414 million, or 2.68 per share for the same period in 2001. amr's operating loss of 1,321 million increased by 763 million compared to the same period in 2001. the company's 2002 results continue to be adversely impacted by the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting effect on the economy and the air transportation industry. on august 13, 2002, the company announced a series of initiatives to reduce its costs, reduce capacity, simplify its aircraft fleet, and enhance productivity. these initiatives include, among other things, de peaking of the company's dallas fort worth international airport hub gradually phasing out operation of its fokker aircraft fleet reducing capacity in the fourth quarter of 2002 and reducing an estimated 7,000 jobs by march 2003. as a result, during the third quarter of 2002, the company recorded approximately 718 million of charges relating to this announcement and related revisions to the company's fleet plan. on september 11, 2001, two of american's aircraft were hijacked and destroyed in terrorist attacks on the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon in northern virginia. on the same day, two united air lines aircraft were also hijacked and used in terrorist attacks. in response to the terrorist attacks, the federal aviation administration faa issued a federal ground stop order on september 11, 2001, prohibiting all flights to, from, and within the united states. airports did not reopen until september 13, 2001 except for washington reagan national airport, which was partially reopened on october 4, 2001 . the company was able to operate only a portion of its scheduled flights for several days thereafter. when flights were permitted to resume, passenger traffic and yields on the company's flights were significantly lower than prior to the attacks. as a result, the company announced that it would reduce its operating schedule to approximately 80 percent of the schedule it flew prior to september 11, 2001. therefore, during the third quarter of 2001, the company recorded approximately 632 million of charges related to the events of september 11, 2001. in addition, during the third quarter of 2001, the company recorded an 809 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement from the u.s. government under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the act . for additional information related to the august 13, 2002 announcement and the events of september 11, 2001, see note 2 in the condensed consolidated financial statements. although traffic has continued to increase on significantly reduced capacity since the events of september 11, 2001, the company's third quarter 2002 revenues were down quarter over quarter. in addition to the residual effects of september 11, the company's revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown, seen largely in business travel declines, the geographic distribution of the company's network and reduced fares. in total, the company's revenues decreased 322 million, or 6.7 percent, in the third quarter of 2002 as compared to the same period last year. american's passenger revenues decreased by 6.9 percent, or 277 million in the third quarter of 2002 from the same period in 2001. american's domestic revenue per available seat mile rasm decreased 6.2 percent, to 7.79 cents, on a capacity decrease of .7 percent, to 32.9 billion available seat miles asms . international rasm decreased to 9.15 cents, or 1.5 percent, on a capacity decrease of 5.5 percent. the decrease in international rasm was due to a 9.3 percent decrease in latin american rasm, offset by a 6.6 percent and 5.6 percent increase in pacific and european rasm, respectively. the decrease in international capacity was driven by a 17.4 percent and 9.3 percent reduction in pacific and european asms, respectively, slightly offset by a 1.0 percent increase in latin american asms, amr eagle's passenger revenues increased 1.2 percent, or 4 million. amr eagle's traffic increased 11.2 percent while capacity remained flat at approximately 1.7 billion asms. cargo revenues decreased 19 million, or 12.0 percent, primarily due to the same reasons as noted above. other revenues decreased 10.4 percent, or 30 million, due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that american performs for other airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel service charges. 11 14 results of operations continued the company's operating expenses increased 8.2 percent, or 441 million. american's cost per asm decreased 6.0 percent to 10.38 cents, excluding the impact of the 2002 and 2001 special charges net of u.s. government grant. wages, salaries and benefits decreased 0.6 percent, or 12 million reflecting i a decrease in the average number of equivalent employees, somewhat offset by higher salaries, and ii increases in the company's pension and health insurance costs, the latter reflecting rapidly rising medical care and prescription drug costs. aircraft fuel expense decreased 10.2 percent, or 79 million, due primarily to a 6.3 percent decrease in the company's fuel consumption and a 4.1 percent decrease in the company's average price per gallon of fuel. maintenance, materials and repairs decreased 13.0 percent, or 43 million, due primarily to a decrease in airframe and engine volumes at the company's maintenance bases. food service decreased 9.6 percent, or 20 million, due primarily to the company's reduced operating schedule and change in level of food service. commissions to agents decreased 48.3 percent, or 100 million, due primarily to a 6.2 percent decrease in passenger revenues and commission structure changes implemented in march 2002. special charges net of u.s. government grant for the third quarter 2002 include i approximately 658 million related to aircraft charges, including a charge of 370 million related to aircraft impairments, ii approximately 57 million in employee charges and 3 million in other charges, and iii a 10 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement from the u.s. government under the act. comparatively, the third quarter 2001 amounts include i approximately 496 million related to aircraft impairments and groundings, ii 61 million in facility exit costs, approximately 55 million in employee charges, 20 million in other charges, and iii an 809 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement from the u.s. government under the act. for additional information, see note 2 in the condensed consolidated financial statements. other operating expenses decreased 13.6 percent, or 132 million, due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that american performs for other airlines, and decreases in travel and incidental costs, credit card and booking fees, advertising and promotion costs, and data processing expenses, which were partially offset by higher insurance and security costs. other income expense increased 50 million due primarily to the following interest expense increased 49 million, or 40.2 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in the company's long term debt. interest capitalized decreased 14 million, or 37.8 percent, due primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits for flight equipment. miscellaneous net increased 11 million, due primarily to earnings on equity investments. 12 15 results of operations continued operating statistics three months ended

for the nine months ended september 30, 2002 was 2.0 billion, or 12.83 per share, as compared to a net loss of 964 million, or 6.26 per share, for the same period in 2001. amr's operating loss for the nine months ended september 30, 2002 was 2.7 billion, compared to an operating loss of 1.3 billion for the same period in 2001. the company's 2002 results continue to be adversely impacted by the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting effect on the economy and the air transportation industry. on april 9, 2001, trans world airlines llc twa llc, a wholly owned subsidiary of amr purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of trans world airlines, inc. twa . accordingly, the operating results of twa llc are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine month period ended september 30, 2002 whereas for 2001 the results of twa llc were included only for the period april 10, 2001 through september 30, 2001. all references to american airlines, inc. include the operations of twa llc since april 10, 2001 collectively, american . on august 13, 2002, the company announced a series of initiatives to reduce its costs, reduce capacity, simplify its aircraft fleet, and enhance productivity. these initiatives include, among other things, de peaking of the company's dallas fort worth international airport hub gradually phasing out operation of its fokker aircraft fleet reducing capacity in the fourth quarter of 2002 and reducing an estimated 7,000 jobs by march 2003. as a result, during 2002, the company recorded approximately 718 million of charges relating to this announcement and related revisions to the company's fleet plan. in addition, the company recorded a one time, non cash charge of 988 million net of tax , effective january 1, 2002, reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change, to write off all of amr's goodwill. on september 11, 2001, two of american's aircraft were hijacked and destroyed in terrorist attacks on the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon in northern virginia. on the same day, two united air lines aircraft were also hijacked and used in terrorist attacks. in response to the terrorist attacks, the federal aviation administration faa issued a federal ground stop order on september 11, 2001, prohibiting all flights to, from, and

company's 2001 results include approximately 632 million of charges related to the events of september 11, 2001. in addition, the company's 2001 results include an 809 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement from the u.s. government under the act, a 685 million asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2001 and a 45 million dollar gain recorded in the second quarter of 2001 from the settlement of a legal matter related to the company's 1999 labor disruption. for additional information related to the august 13, 2002 announcement, the events of september 11, 2001, and the second quarter 2001 asset impairment charge, see note 2 in the condensed consolidated financial statements. although traffic has continued to increase on significantly reduced capacity since the events of september 11, 2001, the company's 2002 revenues were down significantly year over year. in addition to the residual effects of september 11, the company's revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown, seen largely in business travel declines, the geographic distribution of the company's network and reduced fares. in total, the company's revenues decreased 2,050 million, or 13.5 percent, in 2002 versus the same period in 2001. american's passenger revenues decreased by 12.9 percent, or 1,626 million in 2002 as compared to the same period in 2001. american's domestic rasm decreased 11.1 percent, to 8.30 cents, on a capacity decrease of 0.5 percent, to 94.3 billion asms. international rasm decreased to 8.84 cents, or 5.5 percent, on a capacity decrease of 11.1 percent. the decrease in international rasm was due to a 9.8 percent and 3.0 percent decrease in latin american and european rasm, respectively, slightly offset by a 6.0 percent increase in pacific rasm. the decrease in international capacity was driven by a 29.9 percent, 13.1 percent and 5.2 percent reduction in pacific, european and latin american asms, respectively. amr eagle's passenger revenues decreased 10.0 percent, or 110 million. amr eagle's traffic increased 6.9 percent while capacity decreased 2.1 percent, to approximately 4.8 billion asms. as with american, the decrease in amr eagle's revenues was due primarily to the continued impact of the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the economic slowdown. 14 17 results of operations continued cargo revenues decreased 109 million, or 20.8 percent, primarily due to the same reasons as noted above. other revenues decreased 22.2 percent, or 205 million, due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that american performs for other airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel service charges. the company's operating expenses decreased 4.4 percent, or approximately 721 million. american's cost per asm decreased by 1.7 percent to 10.80 cents, excluding the impact of 2002 and 2001 special charges net of u.s. government grant. wages, salaries and benefits increased 5.4 percent, or 322 million, reflecting i a decrease in the average number of equivalent employees, somewhat offset by higher salaries, and ii increases in the company's pension and health insurance costs, the latter reflecting rapidly rising medical care and prescription drug costs. aircraft fuel expense decreased 19.1 percent, or 445 million, due primarily to an 11.9 percent decrease in the company's average price per gallon of fuel and a 6.5 percent decrease in the company's fuel consumption. aircraft rentals increased 46 million, or 7.6 percent, due primarily the addition of twa aircraft. food service decreased 11.8 percent, or 72 million, due primarily to the company's reduced operating schedule and change in level of food service. commissions to agents decreased 38.8 percent, or 268 million, due primarily to a 12.7 percent decrease in passenger revenues and commission structure changes implemented in march 2002. special charges net of u.s. government grant for 2002 include i approximately 658 million related to aircraft charges, including a charge of 370 million related to aircraft impairments, ii approximately 57 million in employee charges and 3 million in other charges, and iii a 10 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement from the u.s. government under the act. comparatively, the 2001 amounts include i a 685 million asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2001 related to the write down of the carrying value of its fokker 100, saab 340 and atr 42 aircraft and related rotables ii third quarter 2001 charges including approximately 496 million related to aircraft impairments and groundings, ii 61 million in facility exit costs, approximately 55 million in employee charges, 20 million in other charges, and iii an 809 million benefit recognized for the reimbursement from the u.s. government under the act. for additional information, see note 2 in the condensed consolidated financial statements. other operating expenses decreased 14.8 percent, or 428 million, due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that american performs for other airlines, and decreases in travel and incidental costs, credit card and booking fees, advertising and promotion costs, and data processing expenses, which were partially offset by higher insurance and security costs. other income expense increased 217 million due to the following interest income decreased 32.5 percent, or 26 million, due primarily to decreases in interest rates. interest expense increased 128 million, or 34.3 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in the company's long term debt. interest capitalized decreased 49 million, or 42.2 percent, due primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits for flight equipment. miscellaneous net decreased 14 million due primarily to a 45 million gain recorded during the second quarter of 2001 from the settlement of a legal matter related to the company's 1999 labor disruption and the write down of certain investments held by the company during the first quarter of 2001. the effective tax rate for the nine months ended september 30, 2002 was impacted by a 57 million charge resulting from a provision in congress' economic stimulus package that changes the period for carrybacks of net operating losses nols . this change allows the company to carry back 2001 and 2002 nols for five years, rather than two years under the existing law, allowing the company to more quickly recover its nols. the extended nol carryback did however, result in the displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years. these credits are now expected to expire before being utilized by the company, resulting in this charge. 15 18 results of operations continued operating statistics nine months ended

government grant liquidity and capital resources net cash used by operating activities in the nine month period ended september 30, 2002 was 472 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 1.3 billion for the same period in 2001, a decrease of 1.8 billion, due primarily to an increase in the company's net loss. included in net cash provided by operating activities during the first nine months of 2002 was approximately 658 million received by the company as a result of the utilization of its 2001 nol's. capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2002 were 1.5 billion, and included the acquisition of seven boeing 757 200s, three boeing 777 200ers, 22 embraer 140s and four bombardier crj 700 aircraft. these capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and debt agreements. proceeds from the sale of equipment and property of 193 million include the proceeds received upon delivery of three mcdonnell douglas md 11 aircraft to fedex. as of september 30, 2002, the company had commitments to acquire the following aircraft 47 boeing 737 800s, 11 boeing 777 200ers, 9 boeing 767 300ers, 102 embraer regional jets and 20 bombardier crj 700s. deliveries of these aircraft are scheduled to continue through 2010. payments for these aircraft are expected to be approximately 209 million during the remainder of 2002, 1.1 billion in 2003, 696 million in 2004 and an aggregate of approximately 3.3 billion in 2005 through 2010. these commitments and cash flows reflect agreements the company has with boeing to defer 34 of its 2003 through 2005 deliveries to 2007 and beyond. in addition to these deferrals, boeing has agreed to provide backstop financing for certain aircraft deliveries in 2003. in return, american has agreed to grant boeing a security interest in certain advance payments previously made and in certain rights under the aircraft purchase agreement between american and boeing. in june 2002, standard poor's downgraded the credit ratings of amr and american, and the credit ratings of a number of other major airlines. the long term credit ratings of amr and american were removed from standard poor's credit watch with negative implications and were given a negative outlook. furthermore, in september 2002, moody's downgraded the unsecured credit ratings of both amr and american and has a negative outlook on these ratings. these reductions in the company's credit ratings have increased its borrowing costs. any additional reductions in amr's or american's credit ratings could further increase its borrowing costs and might limit the availability of future financing. 16 19 liquidity and capital resources continued in the aftermath of the events of september 11, 2001, the company has raised substantial amounts of funding to finance capital commitments and day to day operations. the company expects that it will continue to need to raise significant additional financing in the future to cover its liquidity needs. in addition to the company's approximately 2.8 billion in cash and short term investments as of september 30, 2002, the company has available a variety of future financing sources, including, but not limited to i additional secured aircraft debt, ii sale leaseback transactions of owned property, including aircraft and real estate, iii the recovery of a 567 million receivable from the u.s. government related to a provision in the recently passed economic stimulus package regarding nol carrybacks, iv tax exempt borrowings for airport facilities, v securitization of future operating receipts, vi unsecured borrowings, and vii the potential sale of certain non core assets. no assurance can be given that any of these financing sources will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to the company. however, the company believes it will meet its current financing needs. during 2002, american issued 617 million of enhanced equipment trust certificates secured by aircraft, with interest based on london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread and maturities over various periods, with a final maturity in 2007. upon the completion of this financing, a 1 billion credit facility, established in late 2001 to serve as a bridge for this financing, expired undrawn on september 30, 2002. also during 2002, the company entered into approximately 915 million of various debt agreements secured by aircraft. effective rates on these agreements are fixed or variable based on libor plus a spread and mature over various periods of time through 2017. at september 30, 2002, the effective interest rates on these debt agreements and the enhanced equipment trust certificates described above ranged up to 3.89 percent. during march 2002, the regional airports improvement corporation issued facilities sublease revenue bonds at the los angeles international airport to provide reimbursement to american for certain facility construction costs. the company has recorded the total amount of the issuance of 284 million net of 13 million discount as long term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of september 30, 2002. these obligations bear interest at fixed rates, with an average effective rate of 7.88 percent, and mature over various periods of time, with a final maturity in 2024. the company has received approximately 237 million in reimbursements of facility construction costs and other items through september 30, 2002. the remaining 47 million of the bond issuance proceeds not yet received, classified as other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, are held by the trustee and will be available to the company in the future. in addition, in july 2002, the new york city industrial development agency issued facilities sublease revenue bonds at the john f. kennedy international airport to provide reimbursement to american for certain facility construction costs. the company has recorded the total amount of the issuance of 475 million net of 25 million discount as long term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of september 30, 2002. these obligations bear interest at fixed rates, with an average effective rate of 8.97 percent, and mature in 2012 and 2028. the company has received approximately 372 million in reimbursements of facility construction costs and other items through september 30, 2002. the remaining 103 million of the bond issuance proceeds not yet received, classified as other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, are held by the trustee and will be available to the company in the future. pursuant to the act, the government made available to air carriers, subject to certain conditions, up to 10 billion in federal government guarantees of certain loans. american did not seek such loan guarantees. other information as a result of the september 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers have significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events war risk coverage . at the same time, they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general. pursuant to authority granted in the act, the government has supplemented the commercial war risk insurance until december 15, 2002 with a third party liability policy to cover losses to persons other than employees or passengers. in the event the commercial insurance carriers reduce further the amount of insurance coverage available to the company or further significantly increase the cost of aviation insurance, or if the government fails to renew the war risk insurance that it provides, the company's operations and or financial position and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. 17 20 other information continued as discussed in the company's 2001 form 10 k, a provision in the current allied pilots association apa contract freezes the number of asms and block hours flown under american's two letter marketing code aa by american's regional carrier partners when american pilots are on furlough the asm cap . as amr eagle continues to accept previously ordered regional jets, this asm cap was reached in 2002, necessitating actions to insure compliance with the asm cap. these actions as well as additional potential actions in respect to the asm cap are discussed in the company's 2001 form 10 k. in addition, american has removed its code from some flights of the americanconnection carriers, which are independent carriers that provide feed to american's st. louis hub, and will continue to remove its codes from additional flights of the carriers as warranted. american believes that the combination of these actions will enable it to continue to comply with this asm cap through 2002 and for sometime beyond. in addition, another provision in the current apa contract limits the total number of regional jets with more than 44 seats flown under the american code by american's regional carrier partners to 67 aircraft. similar to the above, as amr eagle continues to accept previously ordered bombardier crj aircraft, this cap would be reached in early 2003. in order to ensure american remains in compliance with this provision, amr eagle has reached an agreement in principle to dispose of 14 embraer 145 aircraft. ultimately, these airplanes will be acquired by trans states airlines, an americanconnection carrier. trans states airlines will operate these aircraft under its two letter airline code ax and expects to deploy these aircraft at its st. louis hub where it feeds american. the potential transaction still requires the consent of certain third parties, including the companies financing these aircraft, and is subject to the negotiation of final documentation. the company believes that if actual investment returns continue at current levels and interest rates remain unchanged through the rest of the year, it will be required to record a significant minimum pension liability as of december 31, 2002. the minimum pension liability would reflect the amount that the pension plans' accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the plans' assets in excess of amounts previously accrued for pension costs. a large portion of the charge would be recorded as a reduction to stockholders' equity, as a component of accumulated comprehensive loss, net of any available tax benefit. although the exact amount of the charge to stockholders' equity is not known at this time, it will likely exceed 1 billion before tax . as of december 31, 2001, the company's minimum pension liability reduced stockholders' equity by approximately 172 million before tax . this charge to stockholders' equity will not affect the company's financial covenants in any of its credit agreements. furthermore, given the company's current financial situation, a deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be necessary. in determining whether a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is necessary, the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the company's deferred tax assets will not be realized. although a valuation allowance is not necessary as of september 30, 2002, due to the existence of available deferred tax liabilities, it is likely that beginning late in the fourth quarter of 2002 or early in the first quarter of 2003 a valuation allowance will be necessary. in effect the company would not be able to recognize a tax benefit of losses incurred, resulting in larger reported net losses. 18 21 fourth quarter outlook capacity for american is expected to be up approximately six percent in the fourth quarter of 2002 compared to last year's fourth quarter levels, and down 13 percent from the fourth quarter of 2000. amr eagle's fourth quarter capacity will be up about ten percent from last year's levels, and down one percent from the fourth quarter of 2000. for the fourth quarter of 2002, the company expects traffic to be up approximately thirteen percent from last year's fourth quarter levels, and down 15 percent from the fourth quarter of 2000. pressure to reduce costs will continue, although the company will continue to see higher benefit and security costs, increased insurance premiums, and greater interest expense. in addition, the company expects to see a 23 percent increase in fuel prices as compared to the fourth quarter of 2001 and a continued decline in commission expense due to the commission changes implemented earlier in 2002. in total, american's unit costs, excluding special charges, for the fourth quarter of 2002 are expected to be down approximately three percent from last year's fourth quarter level. notwithstanding the expected decrease in unit costs however, given the revenue pressures expected to continue into the fourth quarter and the current level of fuel prices, the company expects to incur a significant loss in the fourth quarter, likely in excess of the third quarter loss excluding special charges. in response to these financial challenges, the company is continuing its comprehensive review of its business to better align its cost structure with the current revenue environment, aimed at improving productivity, simplifying operations and reducing costs. in addition, on august 13, 2002, the company announced a series of short and long term initiatives to reduce its costs, reduce capacity, simplify its aircraft fleet, and enhance productivity. these initiatives include, among other things, de peaking of the company's dallas fort worth international airport hub following the de peaking of its chicago hub in april 2002 by scheduling flights into and out of the hub more continuously, with flights spread out more evenly through the day gradually phasing out operation of its fokker aircraft fleet by 2005 and reducing capacity in the fourth quarter of 2002. by de peaking its dallas fort worth and chicago hubs the company believes it can more productively use its employees, gates, and aircraft. in addition, the company announced that it would reduce an estimated 7,000 jobs by march 2003 to realign its workforce with the planned capacity reductions, fleet simplification, and hub restructurings. american subsequently announced that it expects full year capacity for 2003 to be down about three percent from 2002, giving effect to the capacity reduction described above. although american expects these initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs, there can be no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or sufficient. other risk factors as a result of weak domestic and international economic conditions, reduced fares, and the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001, the airline industry as a whole suffered substantial losses in 2001, and is expected to suffer significant losses for 2002. many airlines, in addition to american, have announced reductions in capacity, service and workforce in response to the industry wide reductions in passenger demand and yields. in addition, since september 11, 2001 several air carriers have sought to reorganize under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code, including us airways, inc. us airways , the seventh largest domestic air carrier. more recently, united air lines, inc. united , the second largest domestic air carrier, has publicly stated that, if it is not able to realize substantial cost savings from its current cost savings initiatives, it may be forced to reorganize under the bankruptcy code. successful completion of such reorganizations could present american with competitors with significantly lower operating costs derived from labor, supply, and financing contracts renegotiated under the protection of the bankruptcy code. in addition, historically, air carriers involved in reorganizations have undertaken substantial fare discounting in order to maintain cash flows and to enhance continued customer loyalty. such fare discounting could further lower yields for all carriers, including american. further, the market value of aircraft would likely be negatively impacted if a number of air carriers, including us airways and united, seek to reduce capacity by eliminating aircraft from their fleets. moreover, the increased threat of u.s. military involvement in overseas operations including, for example, the hostilities in afghanistan and the threat of war with iraq could have a material adverse impact on the company's business, financial position including access to capital markets and results of operations and on the airline industry in general. 19 22 forward looking information statements in this report contain various forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section
