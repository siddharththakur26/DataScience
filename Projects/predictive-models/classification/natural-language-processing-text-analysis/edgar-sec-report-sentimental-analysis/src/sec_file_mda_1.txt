item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation year ended december 28, 1997 compared to the year ended december 29, 1996 in november 1996, the company initiated a major restructuring and growth plan designed to substantially reduce its cost structure and grow the business in order to restore higher levels of profitability for the company. by july 1997, the company completed the major phases of the restructuring plan. the 225.0 million of annualized cost savings anticipated from the restructuring results primarily from the consolidation of administrative functions within the company, the rationalization of manufacturing and warehouse facilities including a reduction in the number of production facilities from 26 to 8 and warehouses from 61 to 18 , the elimination of over 6,000 positions including 3,300 from the divestiture of non core businesses described below and approximately 2,800 other positions , the centralization of the company's procurement function and re negotiation of supply contracts resulting in procurement savings for raw materials, components and sourced finished products and the reduction of the company's product offerings and stock keeping units sku's . the restructuring and growth plan also included a redefinition of the company's core product categories and the elimination of those businesses and product lines that did not fit the core categories. sunbeam's core product categories are appliances, health at home, personal care and comfort, outdoor cooking and away from home. product categories and businesses determined to be non core were divested in 1997, including the company's furniture business and its time and temperature, decorative bedding and counselor registered trademark and borg registered trademark scale product lines. in addition, the company sold its textile mill in biddeford, maine in 1997. net sales from continuing operations for 1997 were 1,168.2 million, an increase of 183.9 million or 18.7 over 1996. net sales on a normalized basis, after excluding divested product lines which are not classified as discontinued operations time and temperature products, decorative bedding and counselor registered trademark and borg registered trademark branded scales , increased 22.4 during the year. global sales, on a normalized basis, increased during 1997 in all five of the company's product categories primarily from new product introductions, improved distribution particularly with the company's top ten customers , international geographic expansion and improved price realization for certain products. global sales growth on a normalized basis exceeded 25 in the appliance, outdoor cooking and away from home categories with sales increases of 26.8 , 27.2 and 28.6 , respectively. sales in the health at home category increased 10.7 on a normalized basis and sales in the personal care and comfort category increased 3.4 during 1997. the company's appliance category sales increases were driven by new products, such as re designed blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons, deep fryers and toasters, and by increased distribution with large national mass retailers. sales of outdoor cooking products increased in 1997 after three straight years of declines as a result of increased merchandising and advertising programs, new distribution and the introduction of an entirely new line of grills and accessories for the 1998 season that began to ship in the fourth quarter of 1997 under a new early buy marketing program that included among other things, extended credit terms with due dates in the second quarter of 1998. the company sold approximately 50.0 million of outdoor cooking products under this program in the fourth quarter of 1997. the early buy program for outdoor cooking products is designed to improve customer service levels and production efficiencies with more level seasonal production and distribution activities that have historically peaked in the first half of each year and to drive additional retail sell through of outdoor cooking products by reducing the likelihood of retail stock outs during the important first and second quarter 1998 selling season. sales of personal care and comfort products were up over 30 through september 1997, but suffered during the fourth quarter as a result of lower than expected retail sell through of electric blankets in key northern markets in late 1997 coupled with the inability to service demand for king and queen sized blankets due to shortages of blanket shells. the company anticipates shifting to a more 14 level production for blankets in 1998 in order to more adequately service the seasonal demand for bedding products. health at home category sales increased as a result of new products and improved distribution in the drug channels. away from home sales increased in 1997 as a result of new products, including cordless clippers and titanium blades coupled with increased distribution of commercially rated appliances. also contributing to the company's sales growth in 1997 were its new retail outlet stores, of which 22 were open by the end of 1997. international sales, which represented 21 of total revenues in 1997, grew 31.2 during the year. this sales growth was driven primarily by 54 new 220 volt product introductions and the execution of 25 new international distribution and license agreements. revenue growth of approximately 34 was achieved both in mexico and by the company's latin american export sales organization, and sales in venezuela and canada increased approximately 23 each. european sales fell slightly in 1997, however the company expects that expanded electric blanket and clipper sales along with the help of additional new distribution agreements will benefit european sales in 1998. the gross margin percentage for 1997 increased 19.8 percentage points to 28.3 . this increase reflects the results of many cost savings and margin enhancement initiatives undertaken as part of the company's restructuring plan coupled with the incremental margin attributable to new products and higher revenues associated with the company's growth plan. the company initiated a manufacturing refinement program in the second quarter of 1997 targeted at aggressively improving factory productivity at all of its remaining operations, including the neosho, missouri outdoor cooking products facility which suffered from poor productivity and operating inefficiencies during the 1997 grill season. the benefits of the refinement program began to favorably impact factory productivity in several factories during the third quarter of 1997. the refinement of the neosho facility, which was completed prior to the initiation of production for the 1998 grill season in the fourth quarter, included a revised plant layout to improve material flow, increased usage of common parts in the manufacturing process and modifications to the paint system to increase capacity and throughput. operating earnings for 1997 were 199.4 million, an increase of 195.0 million over 1996, excluding the impact of the 1996 special charge. as a percentage of sales, the operating margin of 17.1 increased 16.6 percentage points above last year's operating margin, excluding 1996 special charges. the operating margin improvements for 1997 were the result of the improved gross margin discussed above and lower selling, general and administrative sg a costs in 1997 associated with the consolidation of six divisional and regional headquarters into one corporate headquarters and one administrative operations center, reduced staffing levels, the outsourcing of certain administrative and distribution functions, a reduction in the number of warehouses, and company wide cost control initiatives. in addition, sg a during 1996 included incremental compensation costs associated with restricted stock awards and other costs related to the employment of a new senior management team, higher than normal expenditures for market research, packaging and other initiatives related to the launch of the company's growth plan, and higher bad debt expenses associated with certain of the company's customers. the cost reduction initiatives and one time items in 1996 coupled with increased sales in 1997 resulted in sg a decreasing as a percentage of sales from 17.4 in 1996 excluding the impact of special charges to 11.2 for 1997. interest expense decreased from 13.6 million in 1996 to 11.4 million in 1997 primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in 1997 due to improved cash flows. the effective income tax of 35 for 1997 and 1996 for earnings loss from continuing operations was lower than the statutory federal and state rates as a result of lower foreign taxes from the utilization of foreign tax credits and loss carryforwards and lower state income taxes as a result of certain state income tax credits. the company's diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 1.41 per share versus a loss per share from continuing operations in 1996 of 2.37. the company's share base utilized in the diluted earnings per share calculation increased approximately 6 during 1997 as a result of an increase in the number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding due to the exercise of stock options and a higher market value of the company's common stock in 1997. 15 the company's discontinued furniture operations, which were sold in march 1997, had revenues of 51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the sale and break even earnings. in 1996, the discontinued furniture operations had net income of .8 million on revenues of 227.5 million and an estimated loss on disposal of the business of 32.4 million, net of applicable income tax benefits. the sale of the company's furniture business assets primarily inventory, property, plant and equipment was completed in march 1997. the company received 69 million in cash and retained accounts receivable related to the furniture business of approximately 50.0 million as of the closing date. the final purchase price for the furniture business was subject to a post closing adjustment based on the terms of the asset purchase agreement and in the first quarter of 1997, after completion of the sale, the company recorded an additional loss on disposal of 13.7 million, net of income tax benefits. see discussion of restructuring, impairment and other costs in note 8 and discontinued operations and assets held for sale in note 9 to the company's consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the individual components of the 1996 special charge and details of the 1997 activity in the company's restructuring accrual. year ended december 29, 1996 compared to the year ended december 31, 1995 the company's operating results for 1996 include the effects of a pre tax special charge of 337.6 million recorded in conjunction with the implementation of its restructuring and growth plan announced in november 1996. approximately 20 of the charge was for cash items primarily for severance costs and lease and other facility exit costs. the special charge to earnings in 1996 is included in the following categories on the consolidated statement of operations in millions pre tax dollar after tax amount per share amount restructuring, impairment and other costs  154.9 1.21 cost of sales  92.3 0.72 selling, general and administrative  42.5 0.33 estimated loss from discontinued operations  47.9 0.39 total  337.6 2.65 net sales from continuing operations of 984.2 million for 1996 represents a decrease of 32.7 million, or 3.2 , from 1995. the company experienced a loss from continuing operations of 196.7 million or 2.37 per share for 1996 versus earnings from continuing operations of 37.6 million or .45 per share diluted in 1995 primarily as a result of the restructuring activities discussed above. the net loss for 1996 was 228.3 million, or 2.75 per share, compared to net earnings of 50.5 million, or 0.61 per share diluted , for 1995. excluding the impact of special charge items for 1996, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased from 60.6 million in 1995 to a loss of 12.9 million in 1996. domestic sales represented approximately 80 of total sales of the company in 1996 and decreased 28.5 million or 3.4 from 1995. this sales decline was driven by lower sales of outdoor cooking products, which declined 7.3 and lower sales of bedding products which declined 9.0 from 1995, primarily as result of lower decorative bedding sales divested in december 1996 . domestic sales of appliance products were flat with sales increases from new products such as vegetable steamers and toaster ovens being offset by reduced pricing on breadmakers. sales of other product categories such as health and personal care products and time and temperature products divested in march 1997 were either flat or declined slightly from 1995 levels. international sales decreased 4.2 million or 2.2 from 1995 primarily as a result of lower sales in latin america due to political and or economic instability in several countries such as ecuador, peru, columbia and venezuela which suffered a bolivar devaluation in april 1996 , a sales decline of 11.2 16 in canada as a result of the bankruptcy filing of the company's then largest canadian customer offset by a 55.0 increase in sales in mexico as a result of a more stable economic environment in 1996. the company's gross margin percentage, excluding the impact of special charges, was 17.9 of sales in 1996, down from 20.4 in 1995, primarily from the underabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and excess manufacturing capacity that has been realigned for 1997 and beyond by the company's restructuring and growth plan cost reduction initiatives. selling, general and administrative sg a expenses, excluding the impact of special charges described above, were 17.6 of sales in 1996 primarily as a result of an inflated cost structure that has been realigned for 1997 and beyond. in addition, a 12.0 million fourth quarter 1996 media advertising campaign and one time expenditures for market research, new packaging, and other growth plan initiatives resulted in higher than normal sg a spending in 1996. also included in 1996 sg a costs were 7.7 million of compensation expense resulting from restricted stock awards made in connection with the employment of a new senior management team. interest expense for 1996 increased from 9.4 million in 1995 to 13.6 million as a result of increased indebtedness of the company for working capital requirements and non recurring capitalized interest in 1995 related to the construction of the hattiesburg manufacturing and distribution center. the effective income tax rate for 1996 decreased 3 percentage points from 1995 to 35.0 as a result of certain foreign and state operating losses for which no tax benefits were recorded and the non deductibility of compensation expense related to restricted stock awards. the company's discontinued furniture operations had revenues of 227.5 million in 1996, up 22.6 from 185.6 million in 1995. this revenue growth was the result of the acquisition of the samsonite registered trademark furniture business in november 1995. excluding the impact of this acquisition, furniture business sales declined 2.1 . earnings from the discontinued furniture operations, net of taxes, declined from 12.9 million in 1995 to .8 million in 1996 primarily as a result of lower gross margins from reduced pricing, underabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and higher raw material costs. in addition, sg a costs increased due to the inclusion of the samsonite registered trademark furniture business, higher distribution and warehousing costs, particularly with resin furniture products and higher bad debt expenses. foreign operations during 1997 approximately 90 of the company's business was conducted in u.s. dollars including both domestic sales, u.s. dollar denominated export sales primarily to certain latin american markets, asian sales and the majority of european sales . the company's exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency and interest rates is generally insignificant. the company's non u.s. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries in mexico, venezuela and canada. venezuela is considered a hyperinflationary economy for accounting purposes for 1995, 1996 and 1997 and mexico reverted to hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997 therefore, translation adjustments related to venezuelan and mexican net monetary assets are included as a component of net earnings. such translation adjustments were not material to 1995, 1996 and 1997 operating results. on a limited basis, the company selectively uses derivatives foreign exchange option and forward contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures that arise in the normal course of business. no derivative contracts are entered into for trading or speculative purposes. the use of derivatives did not have a material impact on the company's financial results in 1995, 1996 and 1997. see note 4 to the company's consolidated financial statements. liquidity and capital resources as of december 28, 1997, the company had cash and cash equivalents of 52.4 million and total debt of 195.2 million. cash used in operating activities during 1997 was 8.2 million compared to 14.2 17 million provided by operating activities in 1996. this decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in earnings before non cash charges in 1997 and the utilization of tax benefits generated from the implementation of the company's restructuring plan, offset by higher accounts receivable due to increased sales in 1997 and certain seasonal dating terms, increased inventory levels in 1997 necessary to support continued anticipated sales growth and the company's initiatives to improve customer service levels and 1997 cash expenditures required to implement the restructuring plan. in addition, cash used in operating activities reflects 59 million of proceeds from the sale of trade accounts receivable under the company's revolving trade accounts receivable securitization program entered into in december 1997 as more fully described in note 3 to the company's consolidated financial statements. capital spending totaled 58.3 million in 1997 and was primarily for new products, cost reduction and capacity expansion initiatives. capital spending in 1996 was 75.3 million including 14.5 million related to the discontinued furniture operations and was primarily attributable to new product development, cost reduction initiatives and a 5.0 million warehouse expansion financed with a capital lease. capital spending in 1995 reflected approximately 59.4 million associated with the hattiesburg facility, 27.4 million related to new product development and 10.8 million attributable to the discontinued furniture business. the remaining 1995 capital spending was related to cost reduction projects, productivity initiatives and environmental compliance including 14.4 million for a powder coat paint system for outdoor cooking products. the company anticipates 1998 capital spending to be approximately 5 of sales and primarily related to new product introductions, capacity additions and certain facility rationalization initiatives. cash provided by investing activities also reflects 91.0 million in proceeds from sales of businesses, assets and product categories determined to be non core to the company's ongoing operations in conjunction with the 1996 restructuring plan. cash used in investing activities for 1995 includes the purchase of a portion of the company's furniture business, which was subsequently divested in full in march 1997. cash provided by financing activities totaled 16.4 million in 1997 and reflects net borrowings of 5.0 million under the company's revolving credit facility, 12.2 million of debt repayments related to the divested furniture operations and other assets sold and 26.6 million in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options, substantially all by former employees of the company. in 1996, cash provided by financing activities of 45.3 million was primarily from increased revolving credit facility borrowings to support working capital and capital spending requirements, 11.5 million in new issuances of long term debt and 4.6 million in proceeds from the sale of treasury shares to certain executives of the company. in july 1997, the company reduced the amount of available borrowings under its september 1996 unsecured five year revolving credit facility from 500 million to 250 million. the company is a party to various environmental proceedings, substantially all related to previously divested operations. in connection with the company's restructuring plan a comprehensive review of environmental exposures was undertaken and the company accelerated its strategy for the resolution and settlement of certain environmental claims. this review and change in strategy resulted in additional environmental reserves being recorded in 1996 as more fully described in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. in management's opinion, the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the company's financial condition. on march 2, 1998, the company announced the signing of definitive agreements to acquire the coleman company, inc., signature brands usa, inc. and first alert, inc. completion of the acquisitions, which is expected in the second quarter of 1998, is contingent on customary conditions, including regulatory approvals, and acquisition debt issuances. in connection with the acquisitions, the company plans to refinance existing revolving and term debt of the acquired companies as well as all or substantially all of its existing long term debt. the company expects to finance the cash portion of the acquisitions and all debt refinancings through a combination of new revolving and term credit facilities and zero coupon notes that will be issued concurrent with the acquisition closings. refer to note 14 for additional information regarding the pending acquisitions. the company believes its cash flow from operations, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, its receivable securitization program, with the proceeds of the anticipated new debt financings discussed above will be sufficient to support working capital needs, capital spending, debt service and acquisition related cash requirements for the foreseeable future. 18 new accounting standards see note 1 to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no. 130, reporting comprehensive income and sfas no. 131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information, both of which are required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 1997. the adoption of these standards will not impact the company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. year 2000 the company has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the year 2000 issue on its operations, including the development and implementation of project plans and cost estimates required to make its information systems infrastructure year 2000 compliant. based on existing information, the company believes that anticipated spending necessary to become year 2000 compliant will not have a material effect on the financial position, cash flows or results of operations of the company, nor will the year 2000 issues cause any material adverse effect on the future business operations of the company. cautionary statements the
