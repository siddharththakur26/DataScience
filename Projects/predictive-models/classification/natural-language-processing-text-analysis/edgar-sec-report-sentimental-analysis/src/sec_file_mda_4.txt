item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation on june 30, 1998, the company announced that the audit committee of the board of directors was initiating a review into the accuracy of prior financial statements. the audit committee's review has since been completed and, as a result of its findings, the company has restated its previously issued consolidated financial statements for 1996 and 1997. see notes 1, 13, 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements. overview in november 1996, the company announced the details of a restructuring plan. by july 1997, the company completed the major phases of the restructuring plan. the plan included the consolidation of administrative functions, a reduction in manufacturing and warehouse facilities including a reduction in the number of production facilities from 26 to 8 and warehouses from 61 to 18 , the elimination of over 6,000 positions including 3,300 from the divestiture of certain businesses described below and approximately 2,800 other positions, some of which were outsourced , the centralization of the company's procurement function and the reduction of the company's product offerings and stock keeping units sku's . the restructuring plan also included the elimination of certain businesses and product lines. in fiscal 1997, sunbeam's core product categories were appliances, health at home, personal care and comfort, outdoor cooking and away from home. other product categories and businesses were divested in 1997, including the company's furniture business and its time and temperature, decorative bedding and counselor registered trademark and borg registered trademark scale product lines. in addition, the company sold its textile mill in biddeford, maine in 1997, while entering into a supply agreement with the mill for future production of blanket shells. the company's operating results for 1996 include pre tax restructuring and asset impairment charges of 110.1 million recorded for the restructuring plan see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements . approximately 29.3 million of these charges were paid in cash in 1996 and 1997, primarily for severance and other employee termination benefits, lease obligations and other exit costs associated with facility closures. the company estimates that approximately 5.2 million will be expended in the future, primarily for lease obligations. the amounts accrued at december 29, 1996, for restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal 1996, exceeded amounts ultimately required. accordingly, the fiscal 1997 consolidated statement of operations reflects the reversal of accruals no longer required and resulted in a restructuring and asset impairment benefit of 14.6 million. in 1996, in conjunction with the initiation of the restructuring plan, the company recorded additional charges totaling 129.1 million, reflected in cost of sales selling, general and administrative expense sg a and loss on sale of discontinued operations. these charges related largely to inventory write downs as a result of the reduction in sku's, costs related to outsourcing and the divestiture of the furniture business. in 1997, the company incurred 38.3 million of expenses related to the restructuring effort undertaken in 1996. these expenses were primarily for equipment movement, package redesign, employee relocation and recruiting, and an additional pre tax loss on the sale of discontinued operations due primarily to lower than anticipated sales proceeds. see notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements. 9 the charges and benefit described above are included in the following categories in the 1997 and 1996 consolidated statements of operations in millions 1997 1996 restructuring and impairment benefit charge  14.6 110.1 cost of goods sold  60.8 selling, general and administrative expenses  15.8 10.1 loss on sale of discontinued operations  22.5 58.2 23.7 239.2 these charges and benefit consisted of the following in millions 1997 1996 write downs fixed assets held for disposal, not in use  34.8 fixed assets held for disposal, used until disposed  14.8 inventory on hand  60.8 other assets, principally trademarks and intangible assets  19.1 129.5 restructuring accruals including amounts expended in 1996 employee severance pay and fringes  7.9 24.7 lease payments and termination fees  6.7 12.6 other exit activity costs, principally facility closure expenses  4.1 14.6 41.4 other related costs incurred employee relocation equipment relocation and installation and other  11.8 3.2 transitional fees related to outsourcing arrangements  4.9 package redesign  4.0 2.0 15.8 10.1 charges included in continuing operations  1.2 181.0 loss on sale of discontinued operations  22.5 58.2 23.7 239.2 at december 29, 1996, the net carrying value of inventory written down as part of the restructuring and asset impairment charges approximated 37.3 million. during 1997, this inventory, a portion of which was product of discontinued operations, was sold for an amount substantially equivalent to its net carrying value. as further described in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, during the fourth quarter of 1996, the company charged sg a for increases of 9.0 million in environmental reserves and 12.0 million in litigation reserves. as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the company also charged 7.7 million to sg a expenses in 1996 for compensation costs associated with restricted stock awards and other costs related to the employment of the then new senior management team. during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 1997, approximately 0.5 million, 4.5 million, 1.5 million and 21.5 million, respectively, of pre tax liabilities provided in prior years and determined to be no longer required were reversed and taken into income. included in these reserves was 8.1 million related to the litigation reserve increase in 1996. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. 10 additionally, effective in the second quarter of fiscal 1997, the company began capitalizing manufacturing supplies inventories, whereas, previously these inventories were charged to operations when purchased. this change increased operating earnings in fiscal 1997 by 2.8 million. a reconciliation of earnings loss from continuing operations for 1997 and 1996, on an adjusted basis follows in millions 1997 1996 operating earnings loss , as reported  104.1 244.5 add deduct restructuring, asset impairment and other related charges  1.2 181.0 environmental reserve increase principally related to divested operations  9.0 litigation reserve increase relating to

56.3 18.2 adjusted earnings loss from continuing operations  6.8 33.9 after consideration of the adjustments above, 1996 results from continuing operations reflect a loss and 1997 continuing operations are marginally profitable. due to a variety of factors, including sales in 1997 which increased inventory positions at certain customers, distribution losses during 1997 and other items, as discussed below, the results for 1997 are not indicative of future results. as discussed in liquidity and capital resources, below, and in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the 1998 results are expected to be impacted materially by charges related to, among other items, a provision for excess inventory, a change in management, changes in business operations resulting in part from acquisitions made in 1998, higher interest costs related to higher debt levels, costs associated with litigation and restructuring and asset impairment costs, as well as costs related to year 2000 issues. year ended december 28, 1997 compared to the year ended december 29, 1996 net sales for 1997 were 1,073.1 million, an increase of 88.9 million or 9 over 1996. after excluding i 4.2 million and 30.8 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively, related to divested product lines which are not classified as discontinued operations time and temperature products, decorative bedding and counselor registered trademark and borg registered trademark branded scales , ii 31.3 million of sales in 1997 of discontinued inventory which resulted primarily from the reduction of sku's as part of the 1996 restructuring plan and for which the inventory carrying value was substantially equivalent to the sales value, and iii a 5.4 million benefit from the reduction of cooperative advertising accruals no longer required in 1997 cooperative advertising costs are recorded as deductions in determining net sales , net sales on an adjusted basis adjusted sales increased 8 over the prior year. adjusted sales, on a worldwide basis, increased during 1997 primarily from new product introductions, expanded distribution particularly with the company's top ten customers , international geographic expansion and increased inventory positions at certain customers. adjusted sales growth was approximately 19 in the appliance category and approximately 12 in outdoor cooking. in the health at home category, adjusted sales increased approximately 5 while adjusted sales in the personal care and comfort category decreased approximately 13 during 1997. as customers reduce inventories to normal levels, 1998 sales are expected to be adversely impacted. 11 sales increases in appliances were driven by new products, such as re designed blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons, deep fryers and toasters, and by increased distribution with large national mass retailers, combined with higher inventory levels at certain customers. sales of outdoor cooking products increased in 1997 attributed to increased merchandising and advertising programs, new distribution and higher inventory levels at certain customers. during 1997, the company lost a significant portion of its outdoor cooking products distribution, including the majority of its grill accessory products distribution. accessories, which accounted for just over 10 of the outdoor cooking sales volume in 1997, generate significantly better margins than the average margins on sales of grills. these distribution changes are expected to adversely impact outdoor cooking sales and margins in the future, until such time as the distribution is regained. sales of personal care and comfort products suffered during the fourth quarter of 1997 as a result of lower than expected retail sell through of electric blankets in key northern markets in late 1997 coupled with the inability to service demand for king and queen sized blankets due to shortages of blanket shells. the company has shifted to a more level production for blankets in 1998 in order to more adequately service the seasonal demand for bedding products. health at home category sales increased as a result of new products and improved distribution in the drug store channels. both personal care and comfort and health at home sales were impacted by increased inventory positions at customers in 1997. away from home sales increased in 1997 as a result of new products, including cordless clippers and titanium blades, coupled with increased distribution of commercially rated appliances. also contributing to the company's sales growth in 1997 were its new retail outlet stores, of which 22 were open by the end of 1997. international sales, which represented 21 of total revenues in 1997, grew 25 during the year. this sales growth was driven primarily by 54 new 220 volt product introductions and a general improvement in demand in export operations and in mexico. net sales growth of approximately 35 was achieved in the latin american export sales organization. most of this growth came from increased business with three exporters. in mexico and venezuela, sales grew 30 and 24 , respectively. canada accounted for the majority of the remaining international sales growth. excluding the effect of i charges to cost of sales related to the restructuring plan in 1996, ii the benefit of reducing reserves no longer required in 1997, and iii the benefit in 1997 of capitalizing manufacturing supplies inventories, gross margin as a percent of adjusted sales would have been approximately 22 in 1997, an improvement of approximately 6 percentage points from 16 in 1996. this increase reflects the results of lower overhead spending, improved factory utilization and labor cost benefits resulting from the company's restructuring plan, coupled with reductions in certain materials costs. the lower overhead spending resulted from a reduction in the number of facilities operated by the company. with fewer facilities used for production purposes, the capacity of the remaining plants was more fully utilized. the labor cost benefits were realized principally from shifting production to mexico. in addition, a broad based program to obtain lower costs for materials contributed to the 1997 margin improvement. excluding the impact of i the restructuring and asset impairment charges to sg a in 1997 and 1996, ii the 1996 charges for the environmental accrual, litigation accrual, and restricted stock grant compensation, and iii the 1997 benefit from the reversal of reserves no longer required, sg a improved to 14 of adjusted sales in 1997, down 5 percentage points from 19 in 1996. this improvement was partially the result of benefits from the consolidation of six divisional and regional headquarters into one corporate headquarters and one administrative operations center, reduced staffing levels, a reduction in the number of warehouses, and company wide cost control initiatives. higher expenditures in 1996 for market research, new packaging and other discretionary charges and higher bad debt expenses associated with certain of the company's customers also contributed to the decrease in sg a costs from 1996 to 1997. operating results for 1997 and 1996, on a comparable basis as described above, were earnings of 74.5 million in 1997 and a loss of 34.8 million in 1996. on the same basis, operating margin increased 12 11 percentage points to 7 of adjusted sales in 1997 versus a loss of 4 in 1996. this improvement resulted from the factors discussed above. interest expense decreased from 13.6 million in 1996 to 11.4 million in 1997 primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in 1997. the 1997 effective income tax rate for continuing operations was higher than the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state and local taxes plus the effect of foreign earnings taxed at other rates and the increase to the valuation reserve for deferred tax assets, offset in part by the reversal of tax liabilities no longer required. for 1996, the effective income tax rate for continuing operations equaled the federal statutory income tax rate. for a reconciliation of income taxes computed at the federal statutory tax rate to the amounts provided, see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. the company's diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 0.60 per share in 1997 versus a loss per share from continuing operations in 1996 of 2.05. the company's share base utilized in the diluted earnings per share calculation increased approximately 6 during 1997 as a result of an increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding due to the exercise of stock options in 1997 and the inclusion of common stock equivalents in the 1997 calculation. the company's discontinued furniture business, which was sold in march 1997, had revenues of 51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the sale and nominal earnings. in 1996, the discontinued furniture business had net income of 0.8 million on revenues of 227.5 million and an estimated loss on disposal of the business of 39.1 million, net of applicable income tax benefits. the sale of the company's furniture business assets primarily inventory, property, plant and equipment was completed in march 1997. the company received 69.0 million in cash, retained approximately 50.0 million in accounts receivable and retained certain liabilities related to the furniture business. the final purchase price for the furniture business was subject to a post closing adjustment based on the terms of the asset purchase agreement and in the first quarter of 1997, after completion of the sale, the company recorded an additional loss on disposal of 22.5 million pre tax. see discussion of restructuring and asset impairment benefit charges in note 8 and discontinued operations and assets held for sale in note 9 to the company's consolidated financial statements for further information regarding sale of the furniture business. year ended december 29, 1996 compared to the year ended december 31, 1995 as described above, the company's operating results for 1996 include i a pre tax charge of 239.2 million recorded in conjunction with the restructuring plan see notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements , ii charges related to increases in environmental 9.0 million and litigation 12.0 million reserves see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements , and iii 7.7 million of charges related to restricted stock grants made to the then new management team see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements . net sales in 1996 of 984.2 million represent a decrease of 32.7 million, or 3 , from 1995. domestic sales represented approximately 80 of total sales of the company in 1996 and decreased 28.5 million or 3 from 1995. this sales decline was driven by lower sales of outdoor cooking products, which declined 7 and lower sales of bedding products which declined 9 from 1995, attributed primarily to lower decorative bedding sales divested in december 1996 . domestic sales of appliance products were flat with sales increases from new products such as vegetable steamers and toaster ovens being offset by reduced pricing on breadmakers. sales of other product categories such as health and personal care products and time and temperature products divested in march 1997 were either flat or declined slightly from 1995 levels. the company's loss from continuing operations was 170.2 million or 2.05 per share for 1996 versus earnings from continuing operations of 37.6 million or 0.45 per share diluted in 1995 largely 13 as a result of the restructuring activities discussed above. the net loss for 1996 was 208.5 million, or 2.51 per share, compared to net earnings of 50.5 million, or 0.61 per share diluted , for 1995. excluding the impact in 1996 of the charges discussed above, operating earnings decreased from 70.2 million in 1995 to a loss of 34.8 million in 1996. international sales decreased 4.2 million or 2 from 1995 primarily as a result of lower sales in latin america which was attributed to political and or economic instability in several countries such as ecuador, peru, columbia and venezuela which suffered a bolivar devaluation in april 1996 , a sales decline of 11 in canada as a result of the bankruptcy filing of the company's then largest canadian customer offset by a 55 increase in sales in mexico as a result of a more stable economic environment in 1996. the company's gross margin percentage, excluding the impact of restructuring and other charges, was 15 of sales in 1996, down from 20 in 1995, primarily from higher manufacturing costs and excess manufacturing capacity. sg a expenses, excluding the impact of the charges described above, were 19 of sales in 1996 compared with 14 of sales in 1995. the higher 1996 expenses were due in part to higher than normal spending for market research, advertising and similar programs and higher bad debt charges associated with certain of the company's customers. operating losses, excluding the restructuring and special charges in 1996, were 34.8 million in 1996, or 4 of sales, as compared with 1995's operating earnings of 70.2 million, or 7 of sales. the decrease in operating results between years is primarily a result of the factors discussed above. interest expense increased from 9.4 million in 1995 to 13.6 million in 1996 as a result of increased indebtedness of the company for working capital requirements and interest capitalized in 1995 related to the construction of the hattiesburg manufacturing and distribution center. the effective income tax rate for 1996 equaled the federal statutory income tax rate. in 1995, the effective income tax rate exceeded the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state and local taxes plus the effect of foreign earning and dividends taxes at other rates. for a reconciliation of income taxes computed at the federal statutory tax rate to the amounts provided, see note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. the company's discontinued furniture business had revenues of 227.5 million in 1996, up 23 from 185.6 million in 1995. this revenue growth was attributed primarily to the acquisition of the samsonite registered trademark furniture business in november 1995. excluding the impact of this acquisition, furniture business sales declined 2 . earnings from the discontinued furniture business, net of taxes, declined from 12.9 million in 1995 to 0.8 million in 1996 primarily as a result of lower gross margins from reduced pricing, underabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and higher raw material costs. in addition, sg a costs increased due to the inclusion of the samsonite registered trademark furniture business, higher distribution and warehousing costs, particularly with resin furniture products and higher bad debt expenses. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. foreign operations during 1997 approximately 90 of the company's business was conducted in u.s. dollars including both domestic sales, u.s. dollar denominated export sales primarily to certain latin american markets, asian sales and the majority of european sales . the company's exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency and interest rates is generally insignificant. the company's non u.s. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries in mexico, venezuela and canada. venezuela is considered a hyperinflationary economy for accounting purposes for 1995, 1996 and 1997 and mexico reverted to hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997 therefore, translation adjustments related to venezuelan and mexican net monetary assets are included as a component of net earnings. such translation adjustments were not material to 1995, 1996 and 1997 operating results. 14 on a limited basis, the company selectively uses derivatives foreign exchange option and forward contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures that arise in the normal course of business. no derivative contracts are entered into for trading or speculative purposes. the use of derivatives did not have a material impact on the company's financial results in 1995, 1996 and 1997. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. seasonality on a consolidated basis, the company's sales do not exhibit substantial seasonality however, sales are strongest during the fourth quarter of the calendar year. additionally, sales of outdoor cooking products are strongest in the first half of the year, while sales of appliances and personal care and comfort products are strongest in the second half of the year. furthermore, sales of a number of the company's products, including warming blankets, vaporizers, humidifiers and grills may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions. liquidity and capital resources as of december 28, 1997, the company had cash and cash equivalents of 52.3 million, working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents of 316.8 million and total debt of 195.2 million. cash used in operating activities during 1997 was 6.0 million compared to 14.2 million provided by operating activities in 1996. this decrease is primarily attributable to increased inventory levels in 1997 and spending in 1997 related to the restructuring initiatives accrued for in 1996, largely offset by an increase in cash generated by earnings in 1997 and an income tax refund net of tax payments in 1997. cash used in operating activities reflects proceeds of 58.9 million from the company's revolving trade accounts receivable securitization program entered into in december 1997 as more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. the company anticipates that cash used in operating activities will increase during 1998, largely from increases in inventory levels. as certain inventories built in 1997 in anticipation of 1998 sales volumes exceed the actual requirements, it will be necessary to dispose of some portions of excess inventories at amounts less than cost. the company expects to continue to use the securitization program to finance a portion of its accounts receivable. capital spending totaled 60.5 million in 1997 and was primarily for capacity expansion initiatives and equipment and tooling for new products and cost reduction. the new product capital spending in 1997 principally related to the appliance category and included costs related to blenders, toasters, standmixers, slow cookers and a soft serve ice cream product. capital spending in 1996 was 75.3 million including 14.5 million related to the discontinued furniture business and was primarily attributable to equipment for new product development, cost reduction initiatives and a 5.0 million warehouse expansion financed with a capital lease. capital spending in 1995 included approximately 59.4 million associated with the hattiesburg facility, 27.4 million related to new product development and 10.8 million attributable to the discontinued furniture business. the remaining 1995 capital spending was related to cost reduction projects, productivity initiatives and environmental compliance including 14.4 million for a powder coat paint system for outdoor cooking products. the company anticipates 1998 capital spending to be approximately 5 of sales and primarily related to new product introductions, capacity additions and certain facility rationalization initiatives. cash provided by investing activities also reflects 91.0 million in proceeds from sales of businesses, assets and product categories as part of the 1996 restructuring plan. cash used in investing activities for 1995 includes the purchase of a portion of the company's furniture business, which was subsequently divested in full in march 1997. cash provided by financing activities totaled 16.4 million in 1997 and reflects net borrowings of 5.0 million under the company's revolving credit facility, 12.2 million of debt repayments related to the divested furniture business and other assets sold and 26.6 million in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options, substantially all by former employees of the company. in 1996, cash provided by financing activities of 45.3 million was primarily from increased revolving credit facility borrowings 15 to support working capital and capital spending requirements, 11.5 million in new issuances of long term debt and 4.6 million in proceeds from the sale of treasury shares to certain executives of the company. in 1995, cash provided by financing activities of 27.8 million was primarily from increased revolving credit facility borrowings of 40.0 million, offset by 13.1 million used for the purchase of the company's common stock for treasury. in july 1997, the company reduced the amount of available borrowings under its september 1996 unsecured five year revolving credit facility from 500 million to 250 million. in early 1998, the company refinanced substantially all of the then outstanding debt see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements . the company is a party to various environmental proceedings. substantially all of the environmental proceedings of the company, before consideration of the acquisitions discussed below, related to previously divested operations. in 1996, a review of environmental exposures was undertaken as a result of the company's intent to accelerate the resolution and settlement of certain environmental claims. this review and change in strategy resulted in additional environmental reserves being recorded in 1996 as more fully described in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. in management's opinion, the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the company's financial condition or results of operations. on march 30, 1998, the company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired approximately 81 of the total number of then outstanding shares of common stock of the coleman company, inc. coleman , in exchange for 14,099,749 shares of the company's common stock and approximately 160 million in cash, as well as the assumption of 1,016 million in debt. the company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in coleman pursuant to a merger transaction for approximately 6.7 million shares of common stock and approximately 87 million in cash. in addition, as a result of litigation related to the merger consideration, the company has entered into a memorandum of understanding subject to court approval pursuant to which the holders of the remaining equity interest in coleman will also receive five year warrants to purchase 4.98 million shares of sunbeam common stock at 7.00 per share. there can be no assurance that the court will approve the settlement as proposed. see part i significant financial and business developments, item 3 legal proceedings and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. coleman is a leading manufacturer and marketer of consumer products for the worldwide outdoor recreation market. coleman's products have been sold domestically and internationally under the coleman registered trademark brand name since the 1920's. the company expects to acquire the remaining equity interest in coleman in the first quarter of 1999. on april 6, 1998, the company completed the cash acquisitions of first alert, inc. first alert , a leading manufacturer of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, and signature brands usa, inc. signature brands , a leading manufacturer of a comprehensive line of consumer and professional products. the first alert and the signature brands acquisitions were valued at approximately 178 million and 253 million, respectively, including the assumption of debt. in order to finance the above acquisitions, and refinance substantially all of the indebtedness of the company, coleman, first alert and signature brands, the company consummated i an offering of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated debentures due 2018 the debentures at a yield to maturity of 5 approximately 2,014 million principal amount at maturity in march 1998, which resulted in approximately 730 million of net proceeds and, ii entered into a revolving and term credit facility new credit facility in april 1998, which provided for an aggregate borrowing of up to 1.7 billion. in march, 1998, the company prepaid a 75.0 million 7.85 industrial revenue bond related to its hattiesburg facility originally due in 2009. in connection with the early extinguishment of this debt, the company will record a charge of 8.6 million in the first quarter of 1998. also, as a result of repayment of certain indebtedness assumed in the coleman acquisition, the company will recognize an extraordinary charge of approximately 104 million in the second quarter of 1998. at june 30, 1998, the company was not in compliance with the covenants and ratios under the new credit facility. the company and its lenders entered into an agreement dated june 30, 1998, which 16 provided that compliance with the covenants would be waived through december 31, 1998. subsequently, pursuant to an amendment dated october 19, 1998, the company is not required to comply with the original financial covenants and ratios under the new credit facility until april 10, 1999, but will be required to comply with an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization covenant, the amounts of which are to be determined, beginning february 1999. at september 30, 1998, following the scheduled repayment of a portion of the term loan, the new credit facility was reduced to 1,698 million in total, of which approximately 1,453 million was outstanding and approximately 245 million was available. in addition, the company's cash balance at september 30, 1998 was approximately 43 million. the company is working closely with its bank lenders and hopes to reach agreement with the bank lenders on a further amendment to the new credit facility containing revised financial covenants which the bank lenders and the company find mutually acceptable. there can be no assurance that such an amendment, or a further waiver of the existing financial covenants, will be entered into with the bank lenders by april 10, 1999. the failure to obtain such an amendment or further waiver would result in a violation of the existing covenants, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the maturity of all outstanding borrowings under the new credit facility. in december 1997, the company entered into a revolving trade accounts receivable securitization program, which expires december, 1998, to sell without recourse, through a wholly owned subsidiary, certain trade accounts receivable, up to a maximum of 70.0 million. the company, as agent for the purchaser of the receivables, retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the purchased receivables. at september 30, 1998, the company had sold approximately 20.0 million of accounts receivable under this program. at december 28, 1997, standby letters of credit aggregating 29 million were outstanding, primarily for insurance, environmental and workers' compensation issues. at september 30, 1998, the standby letters of credit aggregated 56 million, including 5 million related to an acquired company, and were predominately for insurance, pension, environmental and workers' compensation issues. for additional information relating to the acquisitions, debentures and new credit facility, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. the company believes its borrowing capacity under the new credit agreement, cash flow from the combined operations of the company and its acquired companies, existing cash and cash equivalent balances, and its receivable securitization program will be sufficient to support working capital needs, capital spending, and debt service for the foreseeable future. however, if the company is unable to satisfactorily amend the financial covenants and ratio requirements of the new credit facility or obtain a further waiver of the existing covenants and ratio requirements prior to april 10, 1999, the company expects it would, at that time, be in default of the requirements under the new credit facility and, as noted above, the lenders could then require the repayment of all amounts then outstanding under the new credit facility. see, also, item 3, legal proceedings, above. new accounting standards see notes 1 and 15 to the company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no. 130, reporting compreshensive income, sfas no. 131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information, sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, statement of position sop 98 1, accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and sop 98 5, reporting on the costs of start up activities, which are required to be adopted for periods beginning after june 15, 1997. the adoption of these standards is not expected to 17 have a material effect on the company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows, although actual charges incurred may be material due to year 2000 issues, as discussed below. year 2000 the company is continuing the process of assessing the impact of the year 2000 on its operations, including those of its subsidiaries coleman, first alert and signature brands which were acquired by the company in the spring of 1998. the company established a year 2000 program management office in the third quarter of 1998 to manage such continuing assessment and the design and remediation of the systems with assistance from three consulting firms. the company's continuing assessment encompasses the company's information technology functions along with the impact of the effects of noncompliance by its vendors, service providers, customers, and financial institutions. additionally, the company is assessing the impact of noncompliance of embedded microprocessors in its products as well as equipment, such as security and telephone systems and controls for lighting, heating ventilation, and facility access. the company relies on its information technology functions to perform many tasks that are critical to its operations. significant transactions that could be impacted by year 2000 noncompliance include, among others, purchases of materials, production management, order entry and fulfillment, and payroll processing. systems and applications that have been identified by the company to date as not currently year 2000 compliant and which are critical to the company's operations include its financial software systems, which process the order entry, purchasing, production management, general ledger, accounts receivable, and accounts payable functions, and critical applications in the company's manufacturing and distribution facilities, such as the warehouse management application. the company plans to complete corrective work with respect to the company's systems by the second quarter of 1999 with final testing and implementation of such systems occurring in the third quarter of 1999. management believes that, although there are significant systems that will need to be modified or replaced, the company's information systems environment will be made year 2000 compliant prior to january 1, 2000. the company's failure to timely complete such corrective work could have a material adverse impact on the company. the company is not able to estimate possible lost profits arising from such failure. the company is in the process of contacting its vendors and suppliers of products and services to determine their year 2000 readiness and plans. this review includes third party providers to whom the company has outsourced the processing of its cash receipt and cash disbursement transactions and its payroll. the company plans to complete this review during the fourth quarter of 1998. the failure of certain of these third party suppliers to become year 2000 compliant could have a material adverse impact on the company. based on a reassessment of the year 2000 project scope and approach, as well as the time frame remaining to implement a solution for the year 2000 issue, and an assessment of the requirements for operating information systems in the company, the current estimate of the total costs to address and remedy year 2000 issues and to enhance the company's operating systems, including costs for the acquired companies, is approximately 50 million. this estimate includes the costs of software and hardware modifications and replacements and fees to third party consultants, but excludes internal resources which are not separately tracked by the company with respect to the allocation of time to the year 2000 issues. the company expects these expenditures to be financed through operating cash flows or borrowings, as applicable. as of december 28, 1997, the company had expended less than 1 million related to new systems and remediation to address year 2000 and other systems issues, of which the majority was for software licenses and was therefore recorded as capital expenditures. of the remaining estimated expenditures, it is anticipated that approximately 25 will be incurred in 1998, with the remainder in 1999. as the company continues its assessment of the year 2000 issues and its information requirements to execute its business plans, the actual expenditures incurred or to be incurred may differ materially from the amounts shown above. 18 as part of the assessment of the year 2000 on its operations, the company plans to establish a contingency plan for addressing any effects of the year 2000 on its operations, whether due to noncompliance of the company's systems or those of third parties. the company expects to complete such contingency plan by september 30, 1999 such contingency plan will address alternative processes, such as manual procedures to replace those processed by noncompliant systems, potential alternative service providers, and plans to address compliance issues as they arise. subject to the nature of the systems and applications which are not made year 2000 compliant, the impact of such non compliance on the company's operations could be material if appropriate contingency plans cannot be developed prior to january 1, 2000. effects of inflation for each of the three years in the period ended december 28, 1997, the company's cost of raw materials and other product remained relatively stable. to the extent possible, the company's objective is to offset the impact of inflation through productivity enhancements, cost reductions and price increases. subsequent events see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for subsequent events information relating to, among other matters, a change in management, litigation, change in fiscal year end and employment contracts entered into with the former chairman and chief executive officer and other former senior executives of the company. cautionary statements certain statements in this annual report on form 10 k a may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private
