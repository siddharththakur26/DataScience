item 2. management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition. overview net income was 178 million for the third quarter of 2004, including 155 million from exploration and production operations and 85 million from refining and marketing activities. worldwide oil and gas production averaged 323,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the third quarter of 2004 and 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the first nine months of the year. in the third quarter, production was lower than in the first half of the year, primarily because of normal north sea facilities maintenance. the corporation anticipates that full year 2004 production will average 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. in the third quarter of 2004, the corporation s average crude oil selling price was 26.59 per barrel, including the effects of hedging see discussion of selling prices on page 13 . in august, the government of equatorial guinea approved the plan of development for northern block g. the corporation is currently awarding many of the major contracts on this development and expects first production in early 2007. on block a 18 in the malaysia thailand joint development area, the corporation anticipates first production early in 2005. the corporation expects to reach the full contracted rate of 160 million cubic feet per day, net, by the end of 2005, following completion of the buyers gas separation plant, which is being constructed onshore thailand. negotiations with the buyers regarding additional gas sales are at an advanced stage. in libya, the corporation and its partners are in the final stages of negotiations with the libyan national oil company on terms of reentry into our former operations in the country. results of operations net income for the third quarter of 2004 amounted to 178 million, compared with 146 million in the third quarter of 2003. net income for the first nine months of 2004 was 748 million

transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its analysis of variances in segment earnings. management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of transactions rather than only the pre tax amounts. after tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. exploration and production exploration and production earnings from continuing operations increased by 31 million in the third quarter and 213 million in the first nine months of 2004 compared with the corresponding periods of 2003. earnings in the third quarter of 2003 include 30 million

million and 38 million before income taxes , respectively, for accrued severance and a reduction in leased office space in london. after considering the gains on asset sales and other items described above, the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, sales volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses, as discussed below. 12 table of contents part i financial information cont d. results of operations continued selling prices higher average selling prices of crude oil and natural gas increased exploration and

barrel of oil equivalent basis, was 323,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2004 compared with 339,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2003. the decrease results primarily from natural

amortization charges were also lower in the first nine months of 2004 compared with 2003, reflecting lower production volumes and lower unit cost per barrel from changes in the mix of producing fields. other foreign currency translation resulted in pre tax gains of 9 million in the third quarter of 2004 and 11 million in the first nine months of 2004 compared with gains of 2 million and losses of 15 million in the corresponding periods of 2003. foreign currency gains or losses are included in non operating income expense in the income statement. the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in the first nine months of 2004 was 46 compared to 52 in the first nine months of 2003. the corporation s future exploration and production earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes and changes in tax rates. refining and marketing earnings from
