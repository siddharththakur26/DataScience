Equity
    Compensation Plans Not Approved By Security
    Holders

 

    These plans comprise the following:

 

    In 1999 and 2000, the Board compensated former and continuing
    Board members who had served from 1989 to March 31, 1999
    without compensation by issuing promissory notes totaling
    $325,000 and by granting stock options to these same
    individuals. Options to purchase 4,800 shares of common
    stock were granted with an exercise price of $13.75. These
    options vested immediately and expire in March 2010. As of
    December 31, 2005, none of these options had been exercised.

 

    On May 31, 2001, our Board granted to one of our directors,
    Leonard Toboroff, an option to purchase 100,000 shares of
    common stock at $2.50 per share, expiring in October 2011.
    The option was granted for services provided by
    Mr. Toboroff to OilQuip prior to our merger with OilQuip
    Rentals, Inc., including providing financial advisory services,
    assisting in OilQuip’s capital structure and assisting
    OilQuip in finding strategic acquisition opportunities. None of
    these options have been exercised.

 

    In February 2002, we issued warrants to purchase
    233,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of
    $0.75 per share and warrants to purchase 67,000 shares
    of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share
    in connection with a subordinated debt financing. The warrants
    to purchase 233,000 shares were redeemed during December
    2004 for $1.5 million. The remaining 67,000 warrants are
    currently outstanding and expire in February 2012.

 

    In connection with the private placement in April 2004, we
    issued warrants for the purchase of 800,000 shares of our
    common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. A total of
    486,557 of these warrants were exercised in 2005. Warrants for
    4,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $4.65
    were also issued in May 2004 and remain outstanding as of
    December 31, 2005.

FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS.




 

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

 

    To the Board of Directors and Stockholders


    Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc.


    Houston, Texas

 

    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash
    flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

 

    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

 

    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
    consolidated financial position of Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc.
    and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
    consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
    for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

    Service Co., Inc, whose business consisted of providing
    equipment and trained personnel in the Four Corners area of the
    southwestern United States. Mountain Air primarily provided
    compressed air equipment and related products and services and
    trained operators to companies in the business of drilling for
    natural gas. On May 9, 2001, OilQuip merged into a
    subsidiary of Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc. In the merger, all of
    OilQuip’s outstanding common stock was converted into
    2.0 million shares of Allis-Chalmers’ common stock.
    For legal purposes, Allis-Chalmers acquired OilQuip, the parent
    company of Mountain Air. However, for accounting purposes,
    OilQuip was treated as the acquiring company in a reverse
    acquisition of Allis-Chalmers.

 

    On February 6, 2002, we acquired 81% of the outstanding
    stock of Allis-Chalmers Tubular Services Inc.
    (“Tubular”), formerly known as Jens’ Oilfield
    Service, Inc., which supplies highly specialized equipment and
    operations to install casing and production tubing required to
    drill and complete oil and gas wells. On February 2, 2002,
    we also purchased substantially all of the outstanding common
    stock and preferred stock of Strata Directional Technology, Inc.
    (“Strata”), which provides high-end directional and
    horizontal drilling services for specific targeted reservoirs
    that cannot be reached vertically.

 

    In July 2003, through its subsidiary Mountain Air, we entered
    into a limited liability company operating agreement with a
    division of M-I L.L.C. (“M-I”), a joint venture
    between Smith International and Schlumberger N.V. (Schlumberger
    Limited), to form a Texas limited liability company named
    AirComp LLC (“AirComp”). The assets contributed by
    Mountain Air were recorded at Mountain Air’s historical
    cost of $6.3 million, and the assets contributed by M-I
    were recorded at fair market value of $10.3 million. We
    originally owned 55% and M-I originally owned 45% of AirComp. As
    a result of our controlling interest and operating control, we
    consolidated AirComp in our financial statements. AirComp is in
    the compressed air drilling services segment.

 

    On September 23, 2004, we acquired 100% of the outstanding
    stock of Safco-Oil Field Products, Inc. (“Safco”) for
    $1.0 million. Safco leases spiral drill pipe and provides
    related oilfield services to the oil drilling industry.

 

    On September 30, 2004, we acquired the remaining 19% of
    Tubular’ in exchange for 1.3 million shares of our
    common stock. The total value of the consideration paid to the
    seller, Jens Mortensen, was $6.4 million which was equal to
    the number of shares of common stock issued to
    Mr. Mortensen multiplied by the last sale price ($4.95) of
    the common stock as reported on the American Stock Exchange on
    the date of issuance.

 

    On November 10, 2004, AirComp acquired substantially all
    the assets of Diamond Air Drilling Services, Inc. and Marquis
    Bit Co., L.L.C. collectively (“Diamond Air”) for
    $4.6 million in cash and the assumption of approximately
    $450,000 of accrued liabilities. We contributed
    $2.5 million and M-I L.L.C. contributed $2.1 million
    to AirComp LLC in order to fund the purchase. Diamond Air
    provides air drilling technology and products to the oil and gas
    industry in West Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Diamond Air is
    a leading provider of air hammers and hammer bit products.

 

    On December 10, 2004, we acquired Downhole Injection
    Services, LLC (“Downhole”) for approximately
    $1.1 million in cash, 568,466 shares of common stock
    and payment or assumption of $950,000 of debt. Downhole is
    headquartered in Midland, Texas, and provides chemical
    treatments to wells by inserting small diameter, stainless steel
    coiled tubing into producing oil and gas wells.

    On April 1, 2005, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock
    of Delta Rental Service, Inc. (“Delta”) for
    $4.6 million in cash, 223,114 shares of our common
    stock and two promissory notes totaling $350,000. Delta, located
    in Lafayette, Louisiana, is a rental tool company providing
    specialty rental items to the oil and gas industry such as
    spiral heavy weight drill pipe, test plugs used to test blow-out
    preventors, well head retrieval tools, spacer spools and
    assorted handling tools.

 

    On May 1, 2005, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital
    stock of Capcoil Tubing Services, Inc. (“Capcoil”) for
    $2.7 million in cash, 168,161 shares of our common
    stock and the payment or assumption of approximately
    $1.3 million of debt. Capcoil, located in Kilgore, Texas,
    is engaged in downhole well servicing by providing coil tubing
    services to enhance production from existing wells.

 

    On July 11, 2005, we acquired the compressed air drilling
    assets of W.T. Enterprises, Inc. (“W.T.”), based in
    South Texas, for $6.0 million in cash. The equipment
    includes compressors, boosters, mist pumps and vehicles.

 

    On July 11, 2005, we acquired from M-I its 45% interest in
    AirComp and subordinated note in the principal amount of
    $4.8 million issued by AirComp, for which we paid M-I
    $7.1 million in cash and issued to M-I a $4.0 million
    subordinated note bearing interest at 5% per annum. As a
    result, we now own 100% of AirComp.

 

    Effective August 1, 2005, we acquired 100% of the
    outstanding capital stock of Target Energy Inc.
    (“Target”) for $1.3 million in cash and
    forgiveness of a lease receivable of approximately
    $0.6 million. The results of Target are included in our
    directional and horizontal drilling segment as their Measure
    While Drilling equipment is utilized in that segment.

 

    On September 1, 2005, we acquired the casing and tubing
    service assets of Patterson Services, Inc. for approximately
    $15.6 million. These assets are located in Corpus Christi,
    Texas; Kilgore, Texas; Lafayette, Louisiana and Houma, Louisiana.

 

Vulnerabilities
    and Concentrations

 

    We provide oilfield services in several regions, including the
    states of Texas, Utah, Louisiana, Colorado, Oklahoma, and New
    Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico and southern portions of Mexico. The
    nature of our operations and the many regions in which we
    operate subject us to changing economic, regulatory and
    political conditions. We are vulnerable to near-term and
    long-term changes in the demand for and prices of oil and
    natural gas and the related demand for oilfield service
    operations.

 

Use
    of Estimates

 

    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Future events and
    their effects cannot be perceived with certainty. Accordingly,
    our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. While
    management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in
    the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are
    appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates.
    Estimates are used for, but are not limited to, determining the
    following: allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of
    long-lived assets and intangibles, useful lives used in
    depreciation and amortization, income taxes and valuation
    allowances. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of
    the consolidated financial statements

    Statements — (Continued)



    may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired,
    as additional information is obtained and as our operating
    environment changes.

 

Principles
    of Consolidation

 

    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Allis-Chalmers and its subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2005 are Oil Quip, Mountain Air, Tubular,
    Strata, AirComp, Safco, Downhole, Delta, Capcoil and Target. All
    significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated.

 

Revenue
    Recognition

 

    We provide rental equipment and drilling services to our
    customers at per day and per job contractual rates and recognize
    the drilling related revenue as the work progresses and when
    collectibility is reasonably assured. Payments from customers
    for the cost of oilfield rental equipment that is damaged or
    lost-in-hole are reflected as revenues. We recognized revenue
    from damaged or lost-in-hole equipment of $970,000, $41,000 and
    $252,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
    2003, respectively. The Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB)
    No. 104, Revenue Recognition In Financial Statements
    (“SAB No. 104”), provides guidance on
    the SEC staff’s views on the application of generally
    accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition
    issues. Our revenue recognition policy is in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles and
    SAB No. 104.

 

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

 

    Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal
    trade terms. We sell our services to oil and natural gas
    exploration and production companies. We perform continuing
    credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition
    and although we generally does not require collateral, letters
    of credit may be required from customers in certain
    circumstances.

 

    We record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on
    specifically identified amounts that are determined
    uncollectible. We have a limited number of customers with
    individually large amounts due at any given date. Any
    unanticipated change in any one of these customer’s credit
    worthiness or other matters affecting the collectibility of
    amounts due from such customers could have a material effect on
    the results of operations in the period in which such changes or
    events occur. After all attempts to collect a receivable have
    failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. As
    of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had recorded an allowance
    for doubtful accounts of $383,000 and $265,000 respectively. Bad
    debt expense was $219,000, $104,000 and $136,000 for the years
    ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

 

Cash
    Equivalents

 

    We consider all highly liquid investments with an original
    maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
    cash equivalents.

 

Inventories

 

    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
    determined using the first — in, first — out
    (“FIFO”) method or the average cost method, which
    approximates FIFO, and includes the cost of materials, labor and
    manufacturing overhead.

 

Property
    and Equipment

 

    Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Certain equipment held under capital leases are
    classified as equipment and the related obligations are recorded
    as liabilities.

    ENERGY INC.


 

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)


 

    Maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life
    of the related assets, are charged to operations when incurred.
    Refurbishments and renewals are capitalized when the value of
    the equipment is enhanced for an extended period. When property
    and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset
    account and related accumulated depreciation account are
    relieved, and any gain or loss is included in operations.

 

    The cost of property and equipment currently in service is
    depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related
    assets, which range from three to twenty years. Depreciation is
    computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting
    purposes. Capital leases are amortized using the straight-line
    method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and lease
    amortization is included in depreciation expense. Depreciation
    expense charged to operations was $4.9 million,
    $2.7 million and $2.1 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

 

Goodwill,
    Intangible Assets and Amortization

 

    Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity method
    investments, and other intangible assets with infinite lives are
    not amortized, but tested for impairment annually or more
    frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist.
    Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized either
    on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated useful
    life or on a basis that reflects the pattern in which the
    economic benefits of the intangible assets are realized.

 

    We perform impairment tests on the carrying value of our
    goodwill on an annual basis as of December 31st for each of
    our reportable segments. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    no evidence of impairment exists.

 







  


Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets



 

    Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment
    and other intangible assets, and certain other assets are
    reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded in the period in
    which it is determined that the carrying amount is not
    recoverable. The determination of recoverability is made based
    upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, excluding
    interest expense. The impairment loss is determined by comparing
    the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flow
    analysis, with the carrying value of the related assets.

 

Financial
    Instruments

 

    Financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents,
    accounts receivable and payable, and debt. The carrying value of
    cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable and payable
    approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. We
    believe the fair values and the carrying value of our debt would
    not be materially different due to the instruments’
    interest rates approximating market rates for similar borrowings
    at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

 

Concentration
    of Credit and Customer Risk

 

    Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
    cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. We transact our
    business with several financial institutions. However, the
    amount on deposit in two financial institutions exceeded the
    $100,000 federally insured limit at December 31, 2005 by a
    total of $2.0 million. Management believes that the
    financial institutions are financially sound and the risk of
    loss is minimal.

 

    We sell our services to major and independent domestic and
    international oil and gas companies. We perform ongoing credit
    valuations of our customers and provide allowances for probable
    credit losses where



    12

    appropriate. In 2005, none of our customers accounted for more
    than 10% of our consolidated revenues. In the year ended
    December 31, 2004, Matyep in Mexico represented 10.8%, and
    Burlington Resources represented 10.1% of our consolidated
    revenues, respectively. In the year ended December 31,
    2003, Matyep, Burlington Resources, Inc., and El Paso
    Energy Corporation represented 10.2%, 11.1% and 14.1%,
    respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Revenues from Matyep
    represented 94.5%, 98.0% and 100% of our international revenues
    in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

 

Debt
    Issuance Costs

 

    The costs related to the issuance of debt are capitalized and
    amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method,
    which approximates the interest method, over the maturity
    periods of the related debt.

 

Income
    Taxes

 

    We use the liability method for determining our income taxes,
    under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are
    recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under
    this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets
    at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate
    expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or
    recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that
    realization of such benefits is more likely than not.

 

    Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax
    effect of temporary differences between financial and tax bases
    in assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided
    for certain tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance to
    reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely
    than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
    will not be realized.

 

Stock-Based
    Compensation

 

    We account for our stock-based compensation using Accounting
    Principle Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB
    No. 25”). Under APB No. 25, compensation expense
    is recognized for stock options with an exercise price that is
    less than the market price on the grant date of the option. For
    stock options with exercise prices at or above the market value
    of the stock on the grant date, we adopted the disclosure-only
    provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 123, Accounting For Stock-Based
    Compensation (“SFAS 123”). We also adopted
    the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123 for the
    stock options granted to our employees and directors.
    Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized under APB
    No. 25. Had compensation expense for the options granted
    been recorded based on the fair value at the grant date for the
    options, consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123, our
    net income/(loss) and net income/(loss) per share

Segments
    of an Enterprise and Related Information

 

    We disclose the results of our segments in accordance with
    SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments Of An
    Enterprise And Related Information
    (“SFAS No. 131”). We designate the
    internal organization that is used by management for allocating
    resources and assessing performance as the source of our
    reportable segments. SFAS No. 131 also requires
    disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and
    major customers Please see Note 18 for further disclosure
    of segment information in accordance with SFAS No. 131.

 

Pension

    disclosures about employers’ pension and other post
    retirement benefit plans and specifies the accounting and
    measurement or recognition of those plans.
    SFAS No. 132 requires disclosure of information on
    changes in the benefit obligations and fair values of the plan
    assets that facilitates financial analysis. Please see
    Note 3 for further disclosure in accordance with
    SFAS No. 132.

 

Income

    basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share
    are computed on the basis of the weighted average number of
    shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For
    periods through April 12, 2004, preferred dividends are
    deducted from net income and have been considered in the
    calculation of income available to common stockholders in
    computing basic earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share
    is similar to basic earnings per share, but presents the
    dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares
    (e.g., convertible preferred stock, stock options, etc.) as if
    they had been converted. Potential dilutive common shares that
    have an anti-dilutive effect (e.g., those that increase income
    per share) are excluded from diluted earnings per share.

 

    The components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as
    follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Reclassification

 

    Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform
    to current year presentation.

 

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

 

    In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
    Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.
    SFAS No. 154 requires retroactive application of a
    voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period
    financial statements unless it is impracticable.
    SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in the method
    of depreciation, amortization or depletion for long-lived,
    non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting
    estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle.
    SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20,
    “Accounting Changes” and SFAS No. 3,
    “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
    Statements”. SFAS No. 154 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt the
    provisions of SFAS No. 154 as of January 1, 2006
    and do not expect that its adoption will have a material impact
    on our results of operations or financial condition.

    In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,
    Share-Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R revises
    SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation, and focuses on accounting for share-based
    payments for services by employer to employee. The statement
    requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants
    of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial
    statements based on their fair values. We will adopt
    SFAS No. 123R as of January 1, 2006 and will use
    the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model for the calculation of the
    fair value of our employee stock options. Under the modified
    prospective method, stock option awards that are granted,
    modified or settled after January 1, 2006 will be measured
    and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123R.
    Compensation cost for awards granted prior to, but not vested,
    as of January 1, 2006 would be based on the grant date
    attributes originally used to value those awards for pro forma
    purposes under SFAS No. 123. We believe that the
    adoption of this standard will result in an expense of
    approximately $3.2 million, or a reduction in diluted
    earnings per share of approximately $0.18 per share. This
    estimate assumes no additional grants of stock options beyond
    those outstanding as of December 31, 2005. This estimate is
    based on many assumptions including the level of stock option
    grants expected in 2006, our stock price, and significant
    assumptions in the option valuation model including volatility
    and the expected life of options. Actual expenses could differ
    from the estimate.

 

    In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
    Inventory Costs — an Amendment of ARB
    No. 43, Chapter 4, which amends the guidance in ARB
    No. 43 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of
    idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted
    material. SFAS No. 151 requires that these items be
    recognized as current period charges. In addition,
    SFAS No. 151 requires the allocation of fixed
    production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity
    of the production facilities. We are required to adopt
    provisions of SFAS 151, on a prospective basis, as of
    January 1, 2006. We do not believe the adoption of
    SFAS 151 will have a material impact on our future results
    of operations.

 







NOTE 2 —
    


RESTATEMENT



 

Earnings
    Per Share

 

    We understated diluted earnings per share due to an incorrect
    calculation of our weighted shares outstanding for the third
    quarter of 2003, for each of the first three quarters of 2004,
    for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 and for the
    quarter ended March 31, 2005. In addition, we understated
    basic earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our
    weighted average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended
    September 30, 2004. Consequently, we have restated our
    financial statements for each of those periods. The incorrect
    calculation resulted from a mathematical error and an improper
    application of SFAS No. 128. The effect of the
    restatement is to reduce weighted average basic and diluted
    shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended
    September 30, 2004. Consequently, weighted average basic
    and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months
    ended September 30, 2004 were increased.

 

    A restated earnings per share calculation for all affected
    periods reflecting the above adjustments to our results as
    previously restated (see following section), is presented below
    (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):

AirComp
    Acquisition

 

    In connection with the formation of AirComp LLC in 2003, we,
    along with M-I L.L.C. contributed assets to AirComp in exchange
    for a 55% interest and 45% interest, respectively, in AirComp.
    We originally accounted for the formation of AirComp as a joint
    venture. However in February 2005, we determined that the
    transaction should have been accounted for using purchase
    accounting pursuant to SFAS No. 141, Business
    Combinations and recorded the sale of an interest in a
    subsidiary, in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 51, Accounting for Sales of Stock by a
    Subsidiary. Consequently, we restated our financial
    statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, for
    the year ended December 31, 2003 and for the three quarters
    ended September 30, 2004, to reflect the following
    adjustments:

 

Increase
    in Book Value of Fixed Assets.

 

    Under joint venture accounting, we originally recorded the value
    of the assets contributed by M-I to AirComp at M-I’s
    historical cost of $6.9 million. Under purchase accounting,
    we increased the recorded value of the assets contributed by M-I
    by approximately $3.3 million to $10.3 million to
    reflect their fair market value as determined by a third party
    appraisal. In addition, under joint venture accounting, we
    established negative goodwill which reduced fixed assets in the
    amount of $1.6 million. The negative goodwill was amortized
    by us over the lives of the related fixed assets. Under purchase
    accounting, we increased fixed assets by $1.6 million to
    reverse the negative goodwill previously recorded and reversed
    amortization expenses recorded in 2004. Therefore, the cost of
    fixed assets was increased by a total of $4.9 million at
    the time of acquisition. As a result of the increase in fixed
    assets and the reversal of amortization of negative goodwill,
    depreciation expense increased by $98,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 2003.

 

Increase
    in Minority Interest and Capital in Excess of Par
    Value.

 

    Under purchase accounting, minority interest was increased by
    $1.5 million, which was partially offset by minority
    interest expense of $44,000 for the year ended December 31,
    2003. Under purchase accounting, the capital in excess of par
    was increased by $955,000.

Increase
    in Net Income.

 

    Under joint venture accounting, no gain or loss was recognized
    in connection with the formation of AirComp. Under purchase
    accounting, we recorded a $2.4 million non-operating gain
    in the third quarter of 2003.

 

    As a result of the increase in fixed assets, depreciation
    expense was increased for the year ended December 31, 2003
    by $98,000 and minority interest expense decreased by $44,000,
    resulting in a reduction in net income attributable to common
    stockholders of $54,000. However, as a result of recording the
    non-operating gain, net income attributed to common stockholders
    increased by $2.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2003.

 

    A restated consolidated income statement reflecting the above
    adjustments follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

NOTE 3 — 


POST
    RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS



 

Medical
    And Life

 

    Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization that was confirmed by the
    Bankruptcy Court after acceptances by our creditors and
    stockholders and was consummated on December 2, 1988, we
    assumed the contractual obligation to Simplicity Manufacturing,
    Inc. (SMI) to reimburse SMI for 50% of the actual cost of
    medical and life insurance claims for a select group of retirees
    (SMI Retirees) of the prior Simplicity Manufacturing

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)



    Division of Allis-Chalmers. The actuarial present value of the
    expected retiree benefit obligation is determined by an actuary
    and is the amount that results from applying actuarial
    assumptions to (1) historical claims-cost data,
    (2) estimates for the time value of money (through
    discounts for interest) and (3) the probability of payment
    (including decrements for death, disability, withdrawal, or
    retirement) between today and expected date of benefit payments.
    As of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we have
    post-retirement benefit obligations of $335,000, $687,000 and
    $545,000, respectively.

 

401(k)
    Savings Plan

 

    On June 30, 2003, we adopted the 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan
    (the “Plan”). The Plan is a defined contribution
    savings plan designed to provide retirement income to our
    eligible employees. The Plan is intended to be qualified under
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended. It is funded by voluntary pre-tax contributions from
    eligible employees who may contribute a percentage of their
    eligible compensation, limited and subject to statutory limits.
    The Plan is also funded by discretionary matching employer
    contributions from us. Eligible employees cannot participate in
    the Plan until they have attained the age of 21 and completed
    six-months of service with us. Each participant is 100% vested
    with respect to the participants’ contributions while our
    matching contributions are vested over a three-year period in
    accordance with the Plan document. Contributions are invested,
    as directed by the participant, in investment funds available
    under the Plan. Matching contributions of approximately
    $114,000, $35,000 and $10,000 were paid in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
    respectively.

 







NOTE 4 —
    


ACQUISITIONS



 

    In July 2003, through our subsidiary Mountain Air, we entered
    into a limited liability company operating agreement with a
    division of M-I, a joint venture between Smith International and
    Schlumberger N.V. (Schlumberger Limited), to form AirComp,
    a Texas limited liability company. The assets contributed by
    Mountain Air were recorded at Mountain Air’s historical
    cost of $6.3 million, and the assets contributed by M-I
    were recorded at a fair market value of $10.3 million. We
    originally owned 55% and M-I originally owned 45% of AirComp. As
    a result of our controlling interest and operating control, we
    consolidated AirComp in our financial statements. AirComp
    comprises the compressed air drilling services segment.

 

    In September 2004, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of
    Safco for $1.0 million. Safco leases spiral drill pipe and
    provides related oilfield services to the oil drilling industry.

 

    In September 2004, we acquired the remaining 19% of Tubular in
    exchange for 1.3 million shares of our common stock. The
    total value of the consideration paid to the seller, Jens
    Mortensen, was $6.4 million which was equal to the number
    of shares of common stock issued to Mr. Mortensen
    (1.3 million) multiplied by the last sale price ($4.95) of
    the common stock as reported on the American Stock Exchange on
    the date of issuance. This amount was treated as a contribution
    to stockholders’ equity. On the balance sheet, the
    $1.9 million minority interest in Tubular was eliminated.
    The balance of the contribution of $4.4 million was
    allocated as follows: In June 2004, we obtained an appraisal of
    the fixed assets of Tubular which valued the fixed assets at
    $20.1 million. The book value of the fixed assets was
    $15.8 million and the fixed assets appraised value was
    $4.3 million over the book value. We increased the value of
    our fixed assets by 19% of the amount of the excess of the
    appraised value over the book value, or $.8 million. The
    remaining balance of $3.6 million was allocated to goodwill.

 

    In November 2004, AirComp acquired substantially all the assets
    of Diamond Air for $4.6 million in cash and the assumption
    of approximately $450,000 of accrued liabilities. We contributed
    $2.5 million and
    M-I L.L.C.
    contributed $2.1 million to AirComp LLC in order to fund
    the purchase. Goodwill of $375,000 and other intangible assets
    of $2.3 million were recorded in connection with the
    acquisition. Diamond Air provides air drilling technology and
    products to the oil and gas industry in West Texas, New Mexico
    and Oklahoma. Diamond Air is a leading provider of air hammers
    and hammer bit products.

    In December 2004, we acquired Downhole for approximately
    $1.1 million in cash, 568,466 shares of our common
    stock and the assumption of approximately $950,000 of debt.
    Goodwill of $442,000 and other intangible assets of $795,000
    were recorded in connection with the acquisition. Downhole
    provides economical chemical treatments to wells by inserting
    small diameter, stainless steel coiled tubing into producing oil
    and gas wells.

 

    On April 1, 2005, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock
    of Delta for $4.6 million in cash, 223,114 shares of
    our common stock and two promissory notes totaling $350,000. The
    purchase price was allocated to fixed assets and inventory.
    Delta, located in Lafayette, Louisiana, is a rental tool company
    providing specialty rental items to the oil and gas industry
    such as spiral heavy weight drill pipe, test plugs used to test
    blow-out preventors, well head retrieval tools, spacer spools
    and assorted handling tools.

 

    On May 1, 2005, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital
    stock of Capcoil for $2.7 million in cash,
    168,161 shares of our common stock and the payment or
    assumption of approximately $1.3 million of debt. Capcoil,
    located in Kilgore, Texas, is engaged in downhole well servicing
    by providing coil tubing services to enhance production from
    existing wells. Goodwill of $184,000 and other identifiable
    intangible assets of $1.4 million were recorded in
    connection with the acquisition.

 

    On July 11, 2005, we acquired the compressed air drilling
    assets of W.T., based in South Texas, for $6.0 million in
    cash. The equipment includes compressors, boosters, mist pumps
    and vehicles. Goodwill of $82,000 and other identifiable
    intangible assets of $1.5 million were recorded in
    connection with the acquisition.

 

    On July 11, 2005, we acquired from M-I its 45% interest in
    AirComp and subordinated note in the principal amount of
    $4.8 million issued by AirComp, for which we paid M-I
    $7.1 million in cash and issued to M-I a $4.0 million
    subordinated note bearing interest at 5% per annum. As a
    result, we now own 100% of AirComp

 

    Effective August 1, 2005, we acquired 100% of the
    outstanding capital stock of Target for $1.3 million in
    cash and forgiveness of a lease receivable of approximately
    $0.6 million. The purchase price was allocated to the fixed
    assets of Target and resulted in the recording of a
    $0.8 million deferred tax liability. The results of Target
    are included in our directional and horizontal drilling segment
    as their Measure While Drilling equipment is utilized in that
    segment.

 

    On September 1, 2005, we acquired the casing and tubing
    service assets of Patterson Services, Inc. for approximately
    $15.6 million. These assets are located in Corpus Christi,
    Texas; Kilgore, Texas; Lafayette, Louisiana and Houma, Louisiana.

 

    The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of
    accounting. The results of operations of the acquired entities
    since the date of acquisition are included in our consolidated
    income statement.

 

    The following unaudited pro forma consolidated summary financial
    information for the year ended December 31, 2005
    illustrates the effects of the acquisitions of Delta, Capcoil,
    W.T. and the minority interest in AirComp as if the acquisitions
    had occurred as of January 1, 2005, based on the historical
    results of the acquisitions. The following unaudited pro forma

    We are required to file a consolidated U.S. federal income
    tax return. We pay foreign income taxes in Mexico related to
    Allis-Chalmers Tubular Services’ Mexico revenues. There are
    approximately $1.6 million of U.S. foreign tax credits
    available to us and of that amount, the available
    U.S. foreign tax credits may or may not be recoverable by
    us depending upon the availability of taxable income in future
    years and therefore, have not been recorded as an asset as of
    December 31, 2005. Our foreign tax credits begin to expire
    in the year 2007.

    Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of
    assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the
    financial statements that will result in differences between
    income for tax purposes and income for financial statement
    purposes in future years. A valuation allowance is established
    for deferred tax assets when management, based upon available
    information, considers it more likely than not that a benefit
    from such assets will not be realized. We have recorded a
    valuation allowance equal to the excess of deferred tax assets
    over deferred tax liabilities as we were unable to determine
    that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will
    be realized.

 

    The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit the
    utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards
    if there has been a “change of ownership” as described
    in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such a change
    of ownership may limit the our utilization of our net operating
    loss and tax credit carry forwards, and could be triggered by a
    public offering or by subsequent sales of securities by us or
    our stockholders.

    Net operating loss carry forwards for tax purposes at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 were estimated to be
    $16.6 million and $14.5 million, respectively,
    expiring through 2024.

 

    Net future tax-deductible items relate primarily to timing
    differences. Our 1988 Plan of Reorganization established the A-C
    Reorganization Trust to settle claims and to make distributions
    to creditors and certain stockholders. We transferred cash and
    certain other property to the A-C Reorganization Trust on
    December 2, 1988. Payments made by us to the A-C
    Reorganization Trust did not generate tax deductions for us upon
    the transfer but generate deductions for us as the A-C
    Reorganization Trust makes payments to holders of claims.

 

    The Plan of Reorganization also created a trust to process and
    liquidate product liability claims. Payments made by the A-C
    Reorganization Trust to the product liability trust did not
    generate current tax deductions for us upon the payment but
    generate deductions for us as the product liability trust makes
    payments to liquidate claims or incurs other expenses.

 

    We believe the above-named trusts are grantor trusts and
    therefore we include the income or loss of these trusts in our
    income or loss for tax purposes, resulting in an adjustment of
    the tax basis of net operating and capital loss carry forwards.
    The income or loss of these trusts is not included in our
    results of operations for financial reporting purposes.

  Bank
    loans and line of credit agreements

 

    On July 11, 2005, we replaced our previous credit agreement
    with a new agreement that provided for the following senior
    secured credit facilities:

 







 
    • 


    A $13.0 million revolving line of credit. Borrowings were
    limited to 85% of eligible accounts receivable plus 50% of
    eligible inventory (up to a maximum of $2.0 million of
    borrowings based on inventory). This line of credit was used to
    finance working capital requirements and other general corporate
    purposes, including the issuance of standby letters of credit.
    Outstanding borrowings under





    29

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)









 



    this line of credit were $6.4 million at a margin above
    prime and LIBOR rates plus margin averaging approximately 8.1%
    as of December 31, 2005.



 







 
    • 


    Two term loans totaling $42.0 million. Outstanding
    borrowings under these term loans were $42.0 million as of
    December 31, 2005. These loans were at LIBOR rates plus a
    margin which averages approximately 7.8%.



 

    We borrowed against the July 2005 facilities to refinance our
    prior credit facility and the AirComp credit facility, to fund
    the acquisition of M-I’s interest in AirComp and the air
    drilling assets of W.T. and to pay transaction costs related to
    the refinancing and the acquisitions. We incurred debt
    retirement expense of $1.1 million related to the
    refinancing. This amount includes prepayment penalties and the
    write-off of deferred financing fees of the previous financing,
    which has been included in interest expense in the consolidated
    statement of operations.

 

    Borrowings under the July 2005 credit facilities were to mature
    in July 2007. Amounts outstanding under the term loans as of
    July 2006 were to be repaid in monthly principal payments based
    on a 48 month repayment schedule with the remaining balance
    due at maturity. Additionally, during the second year, we were
    to be required to prepay the remaining balance of the term loans
    by 75% of excess cash flow, if any, after debt service and
    capital expenditures. The interest rate payable on borrowings
    was based on a margin over the London Interbank Offered Rate,
    referred to as LIBOR, or the prime rate, and there was a 0.5%
    fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving line of credit. The
    margin over LIBOR was to increase by 1.0% in the second year.
    The credit facilities were secured by substantially all of our
    assets and contain customary events of default and financial and
    other covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur
    additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay
    dividends or make other distributions, create liens and sell
    assets.

 

    All amounts outstanding under our July 2005 credit agreement
    were paid off with the proceeds of our senior notes offering in
    January 2006. We executed an amended and restated credit
    agreement which provides a $25.0 million revolving line of
    credit (See Note 22).

 

    Prior to July 11, 2005, we had a credit agreement dated
    December 7, 2004 that provided for the following credit
    facilities:

 







 
    • 


    A $10.0 million revolving line of credit. Borrowings were
    limited to 85% of eligible accounts receivables, as defined.
    Outstanding borrowings under this line of credit were
    $2.4 million as of December 31, 2004.


 

 
    • 


    A term loan in the amount of $6.3 million to be repaid in
    monthly payments of principal of $105,583 per month. We
    were also required to prepay this term loan by an amount equal
    to 20% of receipts from our largest customer in Mexico. Proceeds
    of the term loan were used to prepay the term loan owed by
    Tubular Services and to prepay the 12% $2.4 million
    subordinated note and retire its related warrants. The
    outstanding balance was $6.3 million as of
    December 31, 2004.


 

 
    • 


    A $6.0 million capital expenditure and acquisition line of
    credit. Borrowings under this facility were payable monthly over
    four years beginning in January 2006. Availability of this
    capital expenditure term loan facility was subject to security
    acceptable to the lender in the form of equipment or other
    acquired collateral. There were no outstanding borrowings as of
    December 31, 2004.



 

    These credit facilities were to mature on December 31, 2007
    and were secured by liens on substantially all of our assets.
    The agreement governing these credit facilities contained
    customary events of default and financial covenants. It also
    limited our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make
    capital expenditures, pay dividends or make other distributions,
    create liens and sell assets. Interest accrued at an adjustable
    rate based on the prime rate and was 6.25% as of
    December 31, 2004. We paid a 0.5% per annum fee on the
    undrawn portion of the revolving line of credit and the capital
    expenditure line.

    In connection with the acquisition of Tubular and Strata in
    2002, we issued a 12% secured subordinated note in the original
    amount of $3.0 million. In connection with this
    subordinated note, we issued redeemable warrants valued at
    $1.5 million, which were recorded as a discount to the
    subordinated debt and as a liability. The discount was amortized
    over the life of the subordinated note beginning
    February 6, 2002 as additional interest expense of which
    $350,000 and $300,000 were recognized in the years ended
    December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively.
    The debt was recorded at $2.7 million at December 31,
    2003, net of the unamortized portion of the put obligation. On
    December 7, 2004, we prepaid the $2.4 million balance
    of the 12% subordinated note and retired the
    $1.5 million of warrants, with a portion of the proceeds
    from our $6.3 million bank term loan.

 

    Prior to July 11, 2005, our AirComp subsidiary had the
    credit facilities described below. These credit facilities were
    repaid in connection with our acquisition of the minority
    interest in AirComp and the refinancing of our bank credit
    facilities described above.

 







 
    • 


    A $3.5 million bank line of credit. Interest accrued at an
    adjustable rate based on the prime rate. We paid a 0.5% per
    annum fee on the undrawn portion. Borrowings under the line of
    credit were subject to a borrowing base consisting of 80% of
    eligible accounts receivable. The balance at December 31,
    2004 was $1.5 million.


 

 
    • 


    A $7.1 million term loan that accrued interest at an
    adjustable rate based on either LIBOR or the prime rate.
    Principal payments of $286,000 plus interest were due quarterly,
    with a final maturity date of June 27, 2007. The balance at
    December 31, 2004 was $6.8 million.


 

 
    • 


    A “delayed draw” term loan facility in the amount of
    $1.5 million to be used for capital expenditures. Interest
    accrued at an adjustable rate based on either the LIBOR or the
    prime rate. Quarterly principal payments were to commence on
    March 31, 2006 in an amount equal to 5.0% of the
    outstanding balance as of December 31, 2005, with a final
    maturity of June 27, 2007. There were no borrowings
    outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2004.



 

    The AirComp credit facilities were secured by liens on
    substantially all of AirComp’s assets. The agreement
    governing these credit facilities contained customary events of
    default and required that AirComp satisfy various financial
    covenants. It also limited AirComp’s ability to incur
    additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay
    dividends or make other distributions, create liens and sell
    assets. We guaranteed 55% of the obligations of AirComp under
    these facilities.

 

    Tubular had two bank term loans with a remaining balance
    totaling $90,000 and $263,000 at December 31, 2005 and
    2004, with interest accruing at a floating interest rate based
    on prime plus 2.0%. The interest rate was 9.25% and 7.25% at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004. Monthly principal payments are
    $13,000 plus interest. The maturity date of one of the loans,
    with a balance of $60,000, was September 17, 2006, while
    the second loan, with a balance of $30,000, had a final maturity
    of January 12, 2007. The balances of these two loans were
    repaid in full in January 2006 with the proceeds from our senior
    notes offering.

 

Notes
    payable and real estate loan

 

    AirComp had a subordinated note payable to M-I in the amount of
    $4.8 million bearing interest at an annual rate of 5.0%. In
    2007 each party had the right to cause AirComp to sell its
    assets (or the other party may buy out such party’s
    interest), and in such event this note (including accrued
    interest) was due and payable. The note was also due and payable
    if M-I sells its interest in AirComp or upon a termination of
    AirComp. At December 31, 2004, $376,000 of interest was
    included in accrued interest. On July 11, 2005, we acquired
    from M-I its 45% equity interest in AirComp and the subordinated
    note in the principal amount of $4.8 million issued by
    AirComp, for which we paid M-I $7.1 million in cash and
    issued a new $4.0 million subordinated note bearing
    interest at 5% per annum. The subordinated note issued to
    M-I requires quarterly interest payments and the principal
    amount is due October 9, 2007. Contingent upon a future
    equity offering,



    31

    Statements — (Continued)



    the subordinated note is convertible into up to
    700,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion price
    equal to the market value of the common stock at the time of
    conversion.

 

    Tubular had a subordinated note payable to Jens Mortensen, the
    seller of Tubular and one of our directors, in the amount of
    $4.0 million with a fixed interest rate of 7.5%. Interest
    was payable quarterly and the final maturity of the note is
    January 31, 2006. The subordinated note was subordinated to
    the rights of our bank lenders. The balance outstanding for this
    note at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $3.0 and
    $4.0 million, respectively. The balance of this
    subordinated note was repaid in full in January 2006 with
    proceeds from our senior notes offering.

 

    As part of the acquisition of Mountain Air in 2001, we issued a
    note to the sellers of Mountain Air in the original amount of
    $2.2 million accruing interest at a rate of 5.75% per
    annum. The note was reduced to $1.5 million as a result of
    the settlement of a legal action against the sellers in 2003. In
    March 2005, we reached an agreement with the sellers and holders
    of the note as a result of an action brought against us by the
    sellers. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid the holders
    of the note $1.0 million in cash, and agreed to pay an
    additional $350,000 on June 1, 2006, and an additional
    $150,000 on June 1, 2007, in settlement of all claims. (See
    Note 16). At December 31, 2005 and 2004 the
    outstanding amounts due were $500,000 and $1.6 million,
    including accrued interest.

 

    In connection with the purchase of Delta, we issued to the
    sellers a note in the amount of $350,000. The note bears
    interest at 2% and the principal and accrued interest is due on
    April 1, 2006.

 

    In connection with the purchase of Tubular, we agreed to pay a
    total of $1.2 million to Mr. Mortensen in exchange for
    a non-compete agreement. Monthly payments of $20,576 are due
    under this agreement through January 31, 2007. In
    connection with the purchase of Safco, we also agreed to pay a
    total of $150,000 to the sellers in exchange for a non-compete
    agreement. We are required to make annual payments of $50,000
    through September 30, 2007. In connection with the purchase
    of Capcoil, we agreed to pay a total of $500,000 to two
    management employees in exchange for non-compete agreements. We
    are required to make annual payments of $110,000 through May
    2008. Total amounts due under non-compete agreements at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $698,000 and $664,000,
    respectively.

 

    In 2000 we compensated directors, including current directors
    Nederlander and Toboroff, who served on the board of directors
    from 1989 to March 31, 1999 without compensation, by
    issuing promissory notes totaling $325,000. The notes bear
    interest at the rate of 5.0%. At December 31, 2005 and
    2004, the principal and accrued interest on these notes totaled
    approximately $96,000 and $402,000, respectively.

 

    Our subsidiary, Downhole, had notes payable to two former
    shareholders totaling $49,000. We were required to make monthly
    payments of $8,878 through June 30, 2005. At
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, the amounts outstanding were $0
    and $49,000.

 

    We also have a real estate loan which is payable in equal
    monthly installments of $4,344 with the remaining outstanding
    balance due on January 1, 2010. The loan has a floating
    interest rate based on prime plus 2.0%. The outstanding
    principal balance was $548,000 at December 31, 2005. The
    balance of this loan was prepaid in full in January 2006 with
    proceeds from our senior notes offering.

 

Other
    debt

 

    In December 2003, Strata, our directional drilling subsidiary,
    entered into a financing agreement with a major supplier of
    downhole motors for repayment of motor lease and repair cost
    totaling $1.7 million. The agreement provided for repayment
    of all amounts not later than December 30, 2005. Payment of
    interest was due monthly and principal payments of $582,000 were
    due on April 2005 and December 2005. The interest rate was fixed
    at 8.0%. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the outstanding
    balance was $0 and $1.2 million.

    We have various equipment financing loans with interest rates
    ranging from 5% to 11.5% and terms ranging from 2 to
    5 years. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
    outstanding balances for equipment financing loans were
    $1.9 million and $530,000, respectively. We also have
    various capital leases with terms that expire in 2008. As of
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, amounts outstanding under
    capital leases were $917,000 and $0, respectively. In January
    2006, we prepaid $350,000 of the outstanding equipment loans
    with proceeds from our senior notes offering.

 







NOTE 9 —
    


COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES



 

    We have placed orders for capital equipment totaling
    $6.8 million to be received and paid for through 2006. Of
    this amount, $3.1 million is for six measurement while
    drilling kits and ancillary equipment for our directional
    drilling segment and $3.7 million is for two new capillary
    tubing units and two new coil tubing units for our production
    services segment. Of the $6.8 million in orders, we are
    firmly committed to approximately $4.4 million as the
    balance may be subject to cancellation with minimal loss of
    prior cash deposits, if any.

 

    We rent office space on a five-year lease which expires November
    2009. We also rent certain other facilities and shop yards for
    equipment storage and maintenance. Facility rent expense for the
    years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $987,000,
    $577,000, and $370,000, respectively.

 

    At December 31, 2005, future minimum rental commitments for
    all operating leases are as follows (in thousands):

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY



 

    In connection with the formation of AirComp in July 2003, we
    eliminated $955,000 of our negative investment in the assets
    contributed to AirComp. Under purchase accounting, we recognized
    a $955,000 increase in stockholders equity. For the year ended
    December 31, 2003, we accrued $350,000 of dividends payable
    to the Preferred Stock holders. No dividends were declared or
    paid.

 

    On March 3, 2004, we entered into an agreement with an
    investment banking firm whereby they would provide underwriting
    and fundraising activities on our behalf. In exchange for their
    services, the investment banking firm received a stock purchase
    warrant to purchase 340,000 shares of common stock at an
    exercise price of $2.50 per share. The warrant was
    exercised in August of 2005. The fair value of the total
    warrants issued in connection with the fundraising activities
    was established in accordance with the Black-Scholes valuation
    model and as a result, $641,000 was added to stockholders’
    equity. The following assumptions were utilized to determine
    fair value: no dividend yield; expected volatility of 89.7%;
    risk free interest rate of 7.00%; and expected life of five
    years.

 

    During 2004, we issued two warrants (“Warrants A and
    B”) for the purchase of 233,000 total shares of our common
    stock at an exercise price of $0.75 per share and one
    warrant for the purchase of 67,000 shares of our common
    stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share
    (“Warrant C”) in connection with their

    subordinated debt financing. Warrants A and B were redeemed for
    a total of $1,500,000 on December 7, 2004. The fair value
    of Warrant C was established in accordance with the
    Black-Scholes valuation model and as a result, $47,000 was added
    to stockholders’ equity. The following assumptions were
    utilized to determine fair value: no dividend yield; expected
    volatility of 67.24%; risk free interest rate of 5.00%; and
    expected life of four years.

 

    On April 2, 2004, we completed the following transactions:

 







 
    • 


    In exchange for an investment of $2.0 million, we issued
    620,000 shares of our common stock for a purchase price
    equal to $2.50 per share, and issued warrants to purchase
    800,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of
    $2.50 per share, expiring on April 1, 2006, to an
    investor group (the “Investor Group”) consisting of
    entities affiliated with Donald and Christopher Engel and
    directors Robert Nederlander and Leonard Toboroff. The aggregate
    purchase price for the common stock was $1.55 million and
    the fair value for the warrants was $450,000.


 

 
    • 


    Energy Spectrum converted its 3,500,000 shares of
    Series A 10% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock,
    including accrued dividend rights, into 1,718,090 shares of
    common stock. Energy Spectrum was granted the preferred stock in
    connection with the Strata acquisition.



 

    On August 10, 2004, we completed the private placement of
    3,504,667 shares of our common stock at a price of
    $3.00 per share. Our net proceeds, after selling
    commissions and expenses, were approximately $9.6 million.
    We issued shares pursuant to an exemption from the Securities
    Act of 1933, and agreed to subsequently register the common
    stock under the Securities Act of 1933 to allow investors to
    resell the common stock in public markets.

 

    On September 30, 2004, we completed the private placement
    of 1,956,634 shares of our common stock at a price of
    $3.00 per share. Our net proceeds, after selling commission
    and expenses, were approximately $5.3 million. We issued
    shares pursuant to an exemption from the Securities Act of 1933,
    and agreed to subsequently register the common stock under the
    Securities Act of 1933 to allow investors to resell the common
    stock in public markets.

 

    On September 30, 2004, we issued 1.3 million shares of
    common stock to Jens Mortensen, a director, in exchange for his
    19% interest in Tubular. As a result of this transaction, we own
    100% of Tubular. The total value of the consideration paid to
    Jens was $6.4 million, which was equal to the number of
    shares of common stock issued to Mr. Mortensen multiplied
    by the last sale price ($4.95) of the common stock as reported
    on the American Stock Exchange on the date of issuance. This
    amount was treated as a contribution to stockholders equity.

 

    On December 10, 2004, we acquired Downhole for
    approximately $1.1 million in cash, 568,466 shares of
    our common stock and payment or assumption of $950,000 of debt.
    Approximately $2.2 million, the value of the common stock
    issued to Downhole’s sellers based on the closing price of
    our common stock issued at the date of the acquisition, was
    added to stockholders’ equity.

 

    As of January 1, 2005, in relation to the acquisition of
    Downhole, we executed a business development agreement with CTTV
    Investments LLC, an affiliate of ChevronTexaco Inc., whereby we
    issued 20,000 shares of our common stock to CTTV and
    further agreed to issue up to an additional 60,000 shares
    to CTTV contingent upon our subsidiaries receiving certain
    levels of revenues in 2005 from ChevronTexaco and its
    affiliates. CTTV was a minority owner of Downhole, which we
    acquired in 2004. Based on the terms of the agreement, no
    additional shares were issued in 2005.

 

    On April 1, 2005, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock
    of Delta, for $4.6 million in cash, 223,114 shares of
    our common stock and two promissory notes totaling $350,000.
    Approximately $1.0 million, the value of the common stock
    issued to Delta’s sellers based on the closing price of our
    common stock issued at the date of the acquisition, was added to
    stockholders’ equity.

    On May 1, 2005, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital
    stock of Capcoil for $2.7 million in cash,
    168,161 shares of our common stock and the payment or
    assumption of approximately $1.3 million of debt.
    Approximately $750,000, the value of the common stock issued to
    Capcoil’s sellers based on the closing price of our common
    stock issued at the date of the acquisition, was added to
    stockholders’ equity.

 

    In August 2005, our stockholders approved an amendment to our
    certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number
    of shares of our common stock from 20 million to
    100 million and to increase our authorized preferred stock
    from 10 million shares to 25 million shares and, we
    completed a secondary public offering in which we sold
    1,761,034 shares for approximately $15.5 million, net
    of expenses.

 

    We also had options and warrants exercised during 2005. Those
    exercises resulted in 1,076,154 shares of our common stock
    being issued for $1.4 million.

 

NOTE 11 —
    REVERSE STOCK SPLIT

 

    We effected a reverse stock split on June 10, 2004. As a
    result of the reverse stock split, every five shares of our
    common stock was combined into one share of common stock. The
    reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of outstanding
    common stock from 31,393,789 to approximately 6,265,000 and
    reduced the number of our stockholders from 6,070 to
    approximately 2,140. All share and related amounts presented
    have been retroactively adjusted for the stock split.

 

NOTE 12 —
    STOCK OPTIONS

 

    In 2000, we issued stock options and promissory notes to certain
    current and former directors as compensation for services as
    directors (See Note 8), and our Board of Directors granted
    stock options to these same individuals. Options to purchase
    4,800 shares of our common stock were granted with an
    exercise price of $13.75 per share. These options vested
    immediately and may be exercised any time prior to
    March 28, 2010. As of December 31, 2005, none of the
    stock options had been exercised. No compensation expense has
    been recorded for these options that were issued with an
    exercise price equal to the fair value of the common stock at
    the date of grant.

 

    On May 31, 2001, the Board granted to Leonard Toboroff, one
    of our directors, an option to purchase 100,000 shares of
    our common stock at $2.50 per share, exercisable for
    10 years from October 15, 2001. The option was granted
    for services provided by Mr. Toboroff to OilQuip prior to
    the merger, including providing financial advisory services,
    assisting in OilQuip’s capital structure and assisting
    OilQuip in finding strategic acquisition opportunities. We
    recorded compensation expense of $500,000 for the issuance of
    the option for the year ended December 31, 2001.

 

    The 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended, permits us to grant
    to our key employees and outside directors various forms of
    stock incentives, including, among others, incentive and
    non-qualified stock options and restricted stock. Stock
    incentive terms are not to be in excess of ten years. As
    disclosed in Note 1, we account for our stock-based
    compensation using APB No. 25. We have adopted the
    disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123 for the
    stock options granted to our employees and directors.
    Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for these
    options.

NOTE 13 — STOCK
    PURCHASE WARRANTS

 

    In conjunction with the Mountain Air purchase by OilQuip in
    February of 2001, Mountain Air issued a common stock warrant for
    620,000 shares to a third-party investment firm that
    assisted us in its initial identification and purchase of the
    Mountain Air assets. The warrant entitles the holder to acquire
    up to 620,000 shares of common stock of Mountain Air at an
    exercise price of $.01 per share over a nine-year period
    commencing on February 7, 2001. The fair value of the
    warrants was established in accordance with the Black-Scholes
    valuation model and as a result $200,000 was added to
    stockholders’ equity.

 

    We issued two warrants (“Warrants A and B”) for the
    purchase of 233,000 total shares of our common stock at an
    exercise price of $0.75 per share and one warrant for the
    purchase of 67,000 shares of our common stock at an
    exercise price of $5.00 per share (“Warrant C”)
    in connection with our subordinated debt financing for Mountain
    Air in 2001. Warrants A and B were subject to cash redemption
    provisions (“puts”) of $600,000 and $900,000,
    respectively. The warrants were recorded at their redemption
    value and were recorded as a discount to the subordinated debt
    and as a liability. The discount was amortized as additional
    interest expense over the life of the debt instrument. The fair
    value of Warrant C was established in accordance with the
    Black-Scholes valuation model and as a result $47,000 was added
    to stockholders’ equity. Warrant C is still
    outstanding at December 31, 2005.

 

    On February 6, 2002, in connection with the acquisition of
    substantially all of the outstanding stock of Strata, we issued
    a warrant for the purchase of 87,500 shares of our common
    stock at an exercise price of $0.75 per share over the term
    of four years. The fair value of the warrant was established in
    accordance with



    36

    ENERGY INC.


 

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)



    the Black-Scholes valuation model and as a result $267,000 was
    added to stockholders’ equity. The warrants were exercised
    and sold in our August 2005 public offering.

 

    In connection with the Strata Acquisition, on February 19,
    2003, we issued Energy Spectrum an additional warrant to
    purchase 175,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise
    price of $0.75 per share. The fair value of the warrant was
    established in accordance with the Black-Scholes valuation model
    and as a result $306,000 was added to stockholders’ equity.
    This transaction was recorded similar to a preferred share
    dividend. The warrants were exercised and sold in our August
    2005 public offering.

 

    In March 2004, we issued a warrant to purchase
    340,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of
    $2.50 per share to Morgan Joseph & Co., in
    consideration of financial advisory services provided by Morgan
    Joseph pursuant to the April 2004 private placement. The fair
    value of the warrants was established in accordance with the
    Black-Scholes valuation model and as a result $626,000 was
    included as a cost of the private placement and an increase in
    stockholders’ equity. The warrants were exercised and sold
    in our August 2005 public offering.

 

    In April 2004, we issued warrants to purchase 20,000 shares
    of common stock at an exercise price of $0.75 per share to
    Wells Fargo Credit, Inc., in connection with the extension of
    credit by Wells Fargo Credit Inc. The fair value of the warrants
    was established in accordance with the Black-Scholes valuation
    model and as a result $48,000 was added to stockholders’
    equity. The related debt discount was amortized over the life of
    the credit agreement. The warrants were exercised in our August
    2005 public offering.

 

    In April 2004, we completed a private placement of
    620,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase
    800,000 shares of common stock to the following investors:
    Christopher Engel; Donald Engel; the Engel Defined Benefit Plan;
    RER Corp., a corporation wholly-owned by director Robert
    Nederlander; and Leonard Toboroff, a director. The investors
    invested $1,550,000 in exchange for 620,000 shares of
    common stock for a purchase price equal to $2.50 per share,
    and invested $450,000 in exchange for warrants to purchase
    800,000 shares of common stock at an exercise of
    $2.50 per share, expiring on April 1, 2006. A total of
    486,557 of these warrants were exercised in 2005.

 

    In May 2004, we issued a warrant to purchase 3,000 shares
    of our common stock at an exercise price of $4.75 per share
    to Jeffrey R. Freedman in consideration of financial advisory
    services to be provided by Mr. Freedman pursuant to a
    consulting agreement. The warrants were exercised in May 2004.
    Mr. Freedman was also granted 16,000 warrants in May of
    2004 exercisable at $4.65 per share. These warrants were
    exercised in November of 2005.

 

    Warrants for 4,000 shares of our common stock at an
    exercise price of $4.65 were also issued in May 2004 and remain
    outstanding as of December 31, 2005.

 

NOTE 14 — LEASE
    RECEIVABLE

 

    In June 2002, our subsidiary, Strata, sold its MWD assets to a
    third party for $1.3 million. Under the terms of the sale,
    we would receive at least $15,000 per month for thirty-six
    months. After thirty-six months, the purchaser had the option to
    pay the remaining balance or continue paying a minimum of
    $15,000 per month for twenty-four additional months. After the
    expiration of the additional twenty-four months, the purchaser
    would repay any remaining balance. This transaction had been
    accounted for as a direct financing lease with the nominal
    residual gain from the asset sale deferred into income over the
    life of the lease. In August of 2005, we acquired 100% of the
    outstanding stock of the buyer and the balance of the lease
    receivable was part of the consideration of the acquisition.
    During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we
    received a total of $146,000, $229,000, and $251,000,
    respectively, in payments from the third party related to this
    lease.

NOTE 15 — RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

    In July 2005, we entered into a lease of a yard in Buffalo,
    Texas which is part owned by our Chief Operating Officer, David
    Wilde. The monthly rent is $3,500.

 

    Alya H. Hidayatallah, the daughter of our Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer, Munawar H. Hidayatallah, has served as our
    Vice President-Planning and Development since April 2005. In
    2005, we paid Ms. Hidayatallah a salary at a rate of
    $80,000 per annum.

 

    At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we owed our Chief Executive
    Officer, $0 and $175,000, respectively, related to deferred
    compensation. In March and April of 2005 we paid all amounts due
    Mr. Hidayatallah.

 

    Until December 2004, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman,
    Munawar H. Hidayatallah and his wife were personal guarantors of
    substantially all of the financing extended to us by commercial
    banks. In December 2004, we refinanced most of our outstanding
    bank debt and obtained the release of certain guarantees. After
    the refinancing, Mr. Hidayatallah continued to guarantee
    the Tubular $4.0 million subordinated seller note until
    July 2005. We paid Mr. Hidayatallah an annual guarantee fee
    equal to one-quarter of one percent of the total amount of the
    debt guaranteed by Mr. Hidayatallah. These fees aggregated
    to $7,250 during 2005 and were paid quarterly, in arrears, based
    upon the average amount of debt outstanding in the prior quarter.

 

    In April 2004, we entered into an oral consulting agreement with
    Leonard Toboroff, one of our directors, pursuant to which we pay
    him $10,000 per month to advise us regarding financing and
    acquisition opportunities.

 

    Jens Mortensen, one of our directors, is the former owner of
    Tubular and held a 19% minority interest in Tubular until
    September 30, 2004. He was also the holder of a
    $4.0 million subordinated note payable issued by Tubular
    and at December 31, 2005 was owed $60,000 in accrued
    interest and $267,000 related to a non-compete agreement. (See
    Note 8). The subordinated note was repaid in January of
    2006 (See Note 22) and the accrued interest was paid
    in January 2006. Mr. Mortensen, formerly the sole
    proprietor of Tubular, owns a shop yard which he leases to
    Jens’ on a monthly basis. Lease payments made under the
    terms of the lease were $16,800, $28,800 and $28,800 for the
    years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
    In addition, Mr. Mortensen and members of his family own
    100% of Tex-Mex Rental & Supply Co., a Texas
    corporation, that sold approximately $0, $167,000 and $173,000
    of equipment and other supplies to Tubular for the years ended
    December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

 

    As described in Note 8, several of our former directors
    were issued promissory notes in 2000 in lieu of compensation for
    services. Our current maturities of long-term debt includes
    $96,000 and $402,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, relative to these notes.

 

NOTE 16 — SETTLEMENT
    OF LAWSUIT

 

    In June 2003, our subsidiary, Mountain Air, filed a lawsuit
    against the former owners of Mountain Air Drilling Service
    Company for breach of the asset purchase agreement pursuant to
    which Mountain Air acquired Mountain Air Drilling Services
    Company, alleging that the sellers stored hazardous materials on
    the property leased by us without our consent and violated the
    non-compete clause in the asset purchase agreement. On
    July 15, 2003, we entered into a settlement agreement with
    the sellers. As of the date of the agreement, we owed the
    sellers a total of $2.6 million including $2.2 million
    in principal and approximately $363,000 in accrued interest. As
    part of the settlement agreement, the note payable to the
    sellers was reduced from $2.2 million to $1.5 million
    and the due date of the note payable was extended from
    February 6, 2006 to September 30, 2007. The lump-sum
    payment due the sellers at that date was $1.9 million. We
    recorded a one-time gain on the reduction of the note payable to
    the sellers of $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2003.
    The gain was calculated by discounting the note payable to
    $1.5 million using a present value calculation and

    accreting the note payable to $1.9 million the amount due
    in September 2007. In March 2005, we reached an agreement with
    the sellers to settle an action brought by the sellers under the
    note. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid
    $1.0 million in April of 2005 and will pay $350,000 on
    June 1, 2006 and the remaining $150,000 on June 1,
    2007, in settlement of all claims.

 

NOTE 17 — GAIN
    ON SALE OF INTEREST IN A SUBSIDIARY

 

    In July 2003, through the subsidiary Mountain Air, we entered
    into a limited liability company operating agreement with a
    division of M-I to form a Texas limited liability company named
    AirComp. Both companies contributed assets with a combined value
    of $16.6 million to AirComp. The contributed assets from
    Mountain Air were contributed at a historical book value of
    approximately $6.3 million and the assets contributed by
    M-I were
    contributed at a fair market value of approximately
    $10.3 million. Prior to the formation of AirComp, we owned
    100% of Mountain Air and after the formation of AirComp,
    Mountain Air owned 55% and M-I owned 45% of the business
    combination. The business combination was accounted for as a
    purchase and we recorded a one-time non-operating gain on the
    sale of the 45% interest in the subsidiary of approximately
    $2,433,000. The gain was calculated after recording the assets
    contributed by M-I of approximately $10.3 million less the
    subordinated note issued to M-I in the amount of approximately
    $4.8 million, recording minority interest of approximately
    $2,049,000 and an increase in equity of $955,000 in accordance
    with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51
    (“SAB 51”). We have not recorded any deferred
    income taxes because the increase in assets and gain is a
    permanent timing difference. We have adopted a policy that any
    gain or loss in the future incurred on the sale in the stock or
    an interest of a subsidiary would be recognized as such in the
    income statement.

NOTE 21 —
    


LEGAL
    MATTERS



 

    We are named from time to time in legal proceedings related to
    our activities prior to our bankruptcy in 1988; however, we
    believe that we were discharged from liability for all such
    claims in the bankruptcy and believe the likelihood of a
    material loss relating to any such legal proceeding is remote.

 

    We are involved in various other legal proceedings in the
    ordinary course of business. The legal proceedings are at
    different stages; however, we believe that the likelihood of
    material loss relating to any such legal proceeding is remote.

 







NOTE 22 —
    


SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS



 

    In January of 2006, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of
    Specialty Rental Tools, Inc. (“Specialty”) for
    $96.0 million in cash. Specialty, located in Lafayette,
    Louisiana, is engaged in the rental of high quality drill pipe,
    heavy weight spiral drill pipe, tubing work strings, blow-out
    preventors, choke manifolds and various valves and handling
    tools for oil and natural gas drilling. During the nine months
    ended September 30, 2005, Specialty generated aggregate
    revenues of $21.8 million.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)


 

    In January of 2006, we closed on a private offering, to
    qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under
    the Securities Act of 1933, of $160.0 million principal
    amount of our 9.0% senior notes due 2014, which we refer to
    as our senior notes. The proceeds of the offering were used to
    fund the acquisition of Specialty, to repay existing debt and
    for general corporate purposes.

 

    In January of 2006, we amended and restated our July 2005 credit
    agreement to increase our borrowing capacity by exchanging the
    existing two year $55.0 million facility for a new four
    year $25.0 million facility. We refer to the July 2005
    credit agreement, as so amended and restated, as our new credit
    agreement. All amounts outstanding under the previous
    $55.0 million credit facility were repaid with proceeds
    from the issuance of our senior notes. The new credit
    agreement’s interest rate is based on a margin over LIBOR
    or the prime rate, and there is a 0.5% fee for the undrawn
    portion. The credit facility is secured by a first priority lien
    on substantially all of our assets.

 

    In January 2006, with proceeds from the sale of our senior notes
    we also prepaid the $3.0 million subordinated seller note
    due to Jens Mortensen, the $548,000 real estate loan and
    $430,000 in various outstanding term and equipment loans.

 

    In February of 2006, David Groshoff resigned from our Board of
    Directors and the Audit Committee. Mr. Groshoff served on
    our Board since 1999, initially under an agreement on behalf of
    the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which is a client of
    Mr. Groshoff’s employer. That agreement permitted the
    PBGC to appoint a member to our Board so long as the PBGC held a
    minimum number of shares of our stock. The PBGC sold all its
    holdings in our stock in August 2005. As an investment
    management employee of JPMorgan Asset Management, Mr. Groshoff
    is subject to his employer’s policies which generally
    prohibit employees from serving on public company boards of
    directors without a meaningful client interest in such
    companies. In light of the PBGC’s sale of our stock, these
    policies required Mr. Groshoff’s resignation from our
    Board. In March 2006, Robert Nederlander was appointed to the
    Audit Committee to replace Mr. Groshoff.

 

    Through March 13, 2006, we received proceeds of
    approximately $784,000 from the exercise of 313,000 warrants.
