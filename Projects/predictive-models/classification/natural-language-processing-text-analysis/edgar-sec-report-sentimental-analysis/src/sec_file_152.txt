Spherix Incorporated

 
Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
1.             Basis of Presentation
On June 25, 2007, the
Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix
Incorporated subsidiary (“InfoSpherix”), subject to shareholder approval.  Accordingly, the operations of InfoSpherix
are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued
operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and the assets held for
sale of the discontinued segment are separately identified in the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The
activities of the “BioSpherix” Division continue to operate through Spherix
Incorporated.
The accompanying
consolidated financial statements of the Company are unaudited and do not
include all of the information and disclosures generally required for annual
financial statements.  In the opinion of
management, the statements contain all material adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial
position as of June 30, 2007, the results of its operations for the three-month
and six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, and its cash flows for the
six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006. 
This report should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K, which does contain the complete information and disclosure
for the year ended December 31, 2006.
2.                          Use of
Estimates and Assumptions
The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  This requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the period.  Accordingly, actual results
could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
3.                          Discontinued
Operations
On June 25, 2007, the
Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix
subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval. 
The InfoSpherix segment comprises the majority of the Company’s
operations.  The sale will allow Spherix
to focus all of its efforts on the BioSpherix Division’s biotechnology
products, with the principal focus on the commercialization of Naturlose.  The sale is subject to the approval of the
Company’s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two days of
the Company’s August 15, 2007 annual meeting.
Facts and Circumstances Leading to the Proposed Sale
Spherix employed a
business model for many years where it operated two separate lines of business —
InfoSpherix and BioSpherix.  In
accordance with the business plan, InfoSpherix earned enough money to support
itself and BioSpherix.  This allowed
InfoSpherix to grow while supplying funds for the research and development
efforts of the BioSpherix Division, which focused on developing
healthcare-related products.
By mid-2004, management
believed that this model would soon have to change.  The product mix in InfoSpherix was shifting
away from the commercial sector to a less profitable government sector.  Clients were beginning to require that the
Company fund the upfront costs for information projects and recover the cost
over the life of the project.  Also, our
BioSpherix products were far enough along where continued development would
soon require significant capital.  In
addition, equity investors interested in BioSpherix did not understand InfoSpherix
and its purpose.  Therefore, responsible
investors were more difficult to attract. 
Our InfoSpherix clients became concerned about our focus on this
business and they questioned our long-term commitment to the business.  Also, our bank stated that it was not
interested in funding biotechnology research. 
Therefore, they required the Company to secure its line of credit with
cash in lieu of receivables and other fixed assets.  Financing for capital equipment was becoming
harder to attract.  As a result, at the
February 17, 2005 meeting, the Board of Directors decided it was time to split
the two divisions and require each one to be self-funding.  On June 8, 2005, the stockholders approved
the establishment of InfoSpherix Incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Spherix.  Subsequently, on January 1,
2006, InfoSpherix began operating as an independent subsidiary.
6 


In December 2005, the FDA
gave Spherix final permission to conduct a Phase 3 clinical trial for Naturlose
as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  The
Company signed agreements with independent contract research organizations to
conduct the Phase 3 trial and engaged another entity to assist in the
development and monitoring of the trials and to consult on FDA issues.  Although initial estimates developed by
Spherix and the above consultants indicated we had sufficient capital to
complete the trial, the Board and management became concerned about long-term
financing.  A manufacturing source needed
to be found and, should complications develop in our Phase 3 trial, final FDA
approval of the protocol could result in significant additional capital
needs.  In addition, it was becoming
clear that InfoSpherix also needed capital to develop next generation products.
In the spring of 2006,
Active Network approached the Company expressing an interest in the reservation
portion of the InfoSpherix business and the Company held some preliminary
discussion with the Active Network during the next few months.  On June 27, 2006, a meeting of the Executive
Advisory Committee of the Board was held in Cumberland, Maryland.  The Committee discussed a potential sale of
all or part of the InfoSpherix subsidiary, along with the use of funds from
this sale and any settlement of our National Park Service dispute.  The Committee agreed that it was premature to
make a decision as to whether any sale of InfoSpherix was desirable.  However, the Committee decided that if a sale
was ever to be pursued, a sale of the entire subsidiary was preferential and
that other potential buyers should be sought.
On November 17, 2006, the
Company received a letter through its FDA consultant requiring additional
expenditures on its Phase 3 clinical trial. 
At this point it was becoming apparent that the Phase 3 trial was going
to be more expensive than first thought.
Also on November 17,
2006, the Company received an unsolicited Letter of Intent (LOI) from Active
Network.  The LOI was for the purchase of
the entire information business.  The Board
met on November 21, 2006.  After review
of the LOI from The Active Network, the Board declined the offer.  Discussions were held on the need to raise
more capital, even with the $6 million settlement related to the National Park
Service.  The rising cost of the Phase 3
trial was discussed along with the need to complete the anti-plaque study of
Naturlose at the University of Maryland. 
Several methods of raising capital were discussed, but no final decision
was made.
A special Board Meeting
was held on January 8, 2007.  The
immediate need to raise capital was discussed and the President was authorized
to seek equity funding for $12-15 million to fund the BioSpherix Division.  In addition, further discussions were held to
consider the possibility of selling InfoSpherix as a means of raising cash.
SC&H Capital
Corporation (“SC&H”), a consulting firm with merger and acquisition
experience, was engaged on January 29, 2007, to assist the management team in
exploring a sale of InfoSpherix.  On
March 6, 2007, the Board of Directors created an Evaluation Committee
consisting of three outside directors appointed to provide SC&H with
guidance in the process and to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of
interest.
During the first several
months of 2007, the President met with several investment bankers about the
possibility of raising capital.  It was
decided that, given the current stock price and early phase of the Phase 3
clinical trial, an equity offering would not be prudent at this time.
On April 13, 2007, a
Board Meeting was held to review the capital raising alternatives.  In the course of reviewing these
alternatives, SC&H reviewed the process it had conducted with management to
that point.  Contact had been made with
approximately 100 companies, including both strategic and financial targets,
through the use of a blind profile which outlined the InfoSpherix
opportunity.  This campaign ultimately
resulted in approximately 10 management presentations provided to various
interested parties.  The above activities
yielded four Letters of Intent, including a revised offer from The Active
Network.  One of the Letters of Intent
was ultimately withdrawn.  SC&H
prepared a comparison of each of the Letters of Intent and presented it to the
Evaluation Committee.  A discussion of
the possible terms and requirements of a deal ensued.
Pursuant to a
recommendation from the Evaluation Committee, the Board concluded that a sale
of InfoSpherix was in the best interests of Spherix and the Board approved a
resolution to accept the offer from Active Network as proposed.  The Evaluation Committee was given the
authority to approve any changes to the LOI consistent with the discussions.
7 


Subsequent negotiations,
led by the management team and outside counsel, were held with The Active
Network and on April 17, 2007, a final LOI was signed.  Detailed due diligence has been conducted by
Active Network and a definitive purchase agreement was executed on June 25,
2007.  The sale is subject to the approval
of the Company’s stockholders and, if ratified, must be completed within two
days of the Company’s August 15, 2007 annual meeting.

4.             Net Income Per Share
Basic net income (loss)
per common share has been computed by dividing net income (loss) by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per common share has been
computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding plus common shares outstanding that are assumed likely to be
exercised.  Diluted net loss per common
share has been computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding without an assumed increase in common shares
outstanding for common stock equivalents, as common stock equivalents are
antidilutive.  Common stock equivalents consist
of stock options and warrants that are assumed likely to be exercised.  Common stock equivalents were 55,470 and
66,886 at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
5.             Stockholders’ Equity
During the six months
ended June 30, 2007, the Company sold 442,358 shares for an additional $757,500
in proceeds under the July 22, 2005, Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (“SEDA”).  At June 30, 2007, the remaining maximum
amount available for future draws under the SEDA was $800,000.
On March 9, 2006, in
exchange for the Company’s agreement to reduce the exercise price to $2.04 per
share, an institutional investor (“the Investor”) agreed to exercise the
remainder of its warrants for the purchase of 585,973 shares of common stock
for total proceeds of approximately $1.2 million.  In connection with these warrants, the
Investor agreed that it would not exercise any of the warrants to the extent
that it would acquire shares of Common Stock exceeding 9.9% of the outstanding
Common Stock, nor would it knowingly sell shares to anyone to the extent that
their holdings in the Company would exceed 4.9% of the outstanding Common
Stock.  The warrants and shares of Common
Stock were issued in transactions exempt from Registration pursuant to Section
4(2) of the Securities Act.  The Company
has registered the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants for resale by
the institutional Investor.
6.             Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Effective January 1,
2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123(R) “Share-Based Payment” (FAS 123R), which requires the measurement of all
employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, using a fair-value based method and the recording of such expense in
the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  The Company uses a Black-Scholes option
pricing model and has elected to use the modified prospective transition method
and, therefore, has not restated results for prior periods.  At the time the Company adopted FAS 123R,
there were no unvested options outstanding. The Company realized stock based
compensation expense of $7,000 and $14,000 for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2007, and $7,000 and $10,000 for the three and six months ended June
30, 2006, respectively, related to 59,000 stock options awarded in February
2006.  The effect of adopting FAS 123R
increased the loss from operations, the loss before taxes, and the net loss by
$7,000 and $14,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, and $7,000
and $10,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, and had no effect
on basic and diluted earnings per share, net cash flow from operations, or net
cash flow from financing activities.
A summary of option
activity under the Company’s employee stock option plan for the six months
ended June 30, 2007, is presented below:

As of June 30, 2007,
there were approximately 25,500 unvested options to purchase common stock under
the plans.  An estimated compensation
cost of $73,000 related to the unvested options is expected to be recognized
over the next 2.6 years.
The Company used the
following assumptions in the Black-Scholes calculation used to measure the fair
value of stock-based compensation in accordance with FAS 123R.

7.             Income Tax
The Company adopted
Financial Standards Accounting Board Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“FIN 48”) on January 1, 2007.  As a result of the implementation of FIN 48,
the Company recognized no material adjustments. 
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on tax
liabilities as interest expense.  At
January 1, 2007 and June 30, 2007, the Company had no unrecognized income tax
benefits and recognized no interest or penalties on income tax liabilities.
The Federal and
significant State statutes of limitations have not expired for the Company’s
tax years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2005.  As such, each of these tax years remain
subject to examination by taxing authorities. 
The Federal and significant State statutes of limitations for the
Company’s tax years ended December 31, 1998, December 31, 1999 and December 31,
2002 have expired; however $10,217,000 of Federal net operating loss
carryforwards generated in these closed years remain available to the Company
and are subject to adjustment prior to utilization in future tax years.
8.             Information by Business Segment
The Company operates via two principal segments,
BioSpherix and InfoSpherix.  BioSpherix
develops proprietary products for commercial applications.  InfoSpherix provides contact center
information and reservation services for government and industry, with
substantially all of InfoSpherix revenue generated from government customers.  Revenue from reservation and tourism services
is greatest in the spring and summer when vacation planning is the
heaviest.  Revenue from other sources
tends to be more evenly spread throughout the year, although the fourth quarter
is historically the low period of the year.
Financial information by
business segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 is
summarized below.

9.             Subsequent Event
In August 2007,
InfoSpherix signed a ten-year lease to rent 13,338 square feet of facility
space in Clarksburg, Maryland, for use as an administrative office for
InfoSpherix.  The target commencement
date for the new lease is November 1, 2007. 
In connection with the signing of the above lease, Spherix also signed a
lease termination agreement on its Beltsville facility.  Under the lease termination agreement,
Spherix will pay a termination fee of $475,000 and the termination date is to
be effective with the commencement of the Clarksburg lease.
On June 25, 2007, as part
of the Definitive Purchase Agreement to sell InfoSpherix, the Company agreed to
terminate the InfoSpherix line-of-credit with Bank of America (“the Bank”)
prior to closing.  Accordingly, the Company
has subsequently closed the line-of-credit with the Bank.  The InfoSpherix bank line-of-credit was
established on March 31, 2006.  The
line-of-credit provided for borrowings up to $1.5 million, was collateralized
by the subsidiary’s accounts receivables and equipment, and contained covenants
on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios.  The Company had no outstanding borrowings
under the Agreement at June 30, 2007, and at the time of termination.
Item
2.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following is intended
to update the information contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2006, and presumes that readers have access to,
and will have read, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” contained in such Form 10-K.
Certain statements in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are identified by the use of
forward-looking words or phrases such as “believes,” “expects,” is or are “expected,”
“anticipates,” “anticipated,” “should” and words of similar impact.  These forward-looking statements are based on
the Company’s current expectations. 
Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the
Company’s actual results could differ materially.  See the Company’s Form 8-K filing dated March
26, 1999, for a more detailed statement concerning forward-looking statements.
Overview
The Company operates via two principal segments,
BioSpherix and InfoSpherix.  BioSpherix
develops proprietary products for commercial applications.  InfoSpherix provides contact center
information and reservation services for government and industry, with
substantially all of InfoSpherix revenue generated from government customers.
11 


BioSpherix engages in product development, notably
tagatose.  The Company’s current focus is
on the non-food use of tagatose, which we will market under the name “Naturlose”.  Our principal efforts have been to explore
whether Naturlose is an effective treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  In April 2007, the Company commenced a Phase
3 trial for this purpose.
InfoSpherix has developed
a niche in providing campground and other reservation services via its
ReserveWorld business line and is one of only two major suppliers of campground
reservation services in the U.S.  Reservation
contracts make up over 50% of the Company’s revenue.  The reservation services contracts have
revenue streams that are historically greater in the spring and summer months
when vacation planning is more prevalent. 
These reservation contracts have certain fixed costs that continue
throughout the year such as depreciation, telephone and computer related
service and maintenance contracts, and minimum staffing requirements.  These contracts also incur certain costs in
advance of the peak seasons in order to staff up and train the work force that
will be needed during the peak seasons. 
On January 23, 2007, the Company concluded its long-standing National
Park Service contract.  The National Park
Service contract contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.
On June 25, 2007, the
Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the InfoSpherix
subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval. 
The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of its efforts on the
BioSpherix Division’s biotechnology products, with the principal focus on the
commercialization of Naturlose.  The sale
is subject to the approval of the Company’s stockholders and, if ratified, must
be completed within two days of the Company’s August 15, 2007 annual meeting.
The operations of
InfoSpherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as
discontinued operations.
Results of Operations for the
Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 and 2006
Selling, General and
Administrative
Selling, general and
administrative expenses (S,G&A) for the three and six months ended June 30,
2007, increased $386,000 and $494,000 over those of the same periods in
2006.  The increase in the second quarter
was primarily the result of an executive bonus of $150,000 awarded to the CEO
for past performance, and an increase in accounting costs of approximately
$120,000 related to the increased complexity of the Company’s tax reporting
requirements including the implementation of FIN 48.  The increase in S,G&A costs for the six
months ended June 30, 2007 over those of the prior year also included
approximately $120,000 in costs related to the services of an investment banker
prior to the Company’s decision to sell InfoSpherix.  Excluded from the above S,G&A numbers is
approximately $170,000 in consulting and legal costs related to the sale of
InfoSpherix that have been classified as part of the costs of the discontinued
operations.  These costs were incurred in
the second quarter of 2007, following the decision to sell InfoSpherix.
Research
and Development
The Company’s R&D
expenditures have significantly increased between years as a direct result of
the Company’s Phase 3 clinical trial in
the use of Naturlose for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, which began
this year.  The primary focus of BioSpherix’s research and development (R&D)
activities for the six months
ended June 30, 2007, has been on the planning and preparation of a Phase 3
trial.  The Company has completed
an initial dose range-finding study, and the recruitment of patients for the
trial, which will take place in Australia and the United States, is
ongoing.  The first participants began
the Phase 3 clinical trial in April 2007. 
More than 400 subjects from the United States and abroad, representing
the demographic mix in the U.S., will receive oral doses of Naturlose to test
its ability to treat Type 2 diabetes.  A
Phase 3 clinical trial, which gathers evidence regarding effectiveness and
safety, is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of new drugs
proposed to the FDA.  The Company
believes its chances for a successful outcome are enhanced by the widely
demonstrated safety of the product, lack of safety being the primary cause for
failure of most drug candidates.  Testing
is scheduled to finish in mid-2009.  If
the trial is successful, it will likely take several months to compile the data
and submit a new drug application (“NDA”) to the FDA.  The FDA will then likely take up to a year to
respond to the NDA.  Accordingly, we do
not expect FDA approval before mid-2010 at the earliest.
12 


In 2005, the Company
contracted with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to conduct a
human clinical trial on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose.  The study demonstrated tagatose to be much
more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is sorbitol, a sugar
substitute that is widely used in oral care products.  The study suggested ways of modifying the
Naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction.  Such modifications have been made, and the
Company has arranged with the University of Maryland School of Dentistry to
conduct a trial of Naturlose toothpaste formulated by the Company in an attempt
to establish an anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis claim for the toothpaste.  The clinical trial started in early 2007.

Revenue for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2007, decreased $1.1 million (14%) and $1.7 million
(12%) from the same periods in 2006 due to the completion of the National Park
Service contract, which concluded on January 23, 2007.  Reductions from the direct costs associated
with the National Park Service Contract were off-set by increased costs under
the new Michigan contract and additional costs incurred under the contracts
transferred from the former South Dakota facility to the new facility in
Indiana.  The National Park Service
contract contributed approximately $4.0 million in revenue for each of the years
ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.
Liquidity and Capital Resources,
Consolidated
On June 25, 2007, as part
of the Definitive Purchase Agreement to sell InfoSpherix, the Company agreed to
terminate the InfoSpherix line-of-credit with Bank of America (“the Bank”)
prior to closing.  Accordingly, the
Company subsequently closed the line-of-credit with the Bank.  The InfoSpherix bank line-of-credit was
established on March 31, 2006.  The
line-of-credit provided for borrowings up to $1.5 million, was collateralized
by the subsidiary’s accounts receivables and equipment, and contained covenants
on tangible net worth and funded debt to EBITDA ratios.  The interest rate under the Agreement was
based on the LIBOR daily floating rate plus 3% (approximately 8.5% at June 30,
2007).  The Company had no outstanding
borrowings under the Agreement at June 30, 2007, and the total amount available
for future advances to the subsidiary was $1.5 million under the Agreement.

June 30, 2007, was $7.8 million, which represents a $3.1 million decrease from
working capital of $10.9 million at December 31, 2006.  The decrease in working capital was largely
related to the Company’s Phase 3 clinical trial costs and increased costs
related to the anticipated sale of InfoSpherix.
Spherix expects to expend
up to $5 million over the next year in costs related to the Phase 3 clinical
trial and other R&D activity.  The
clinical trial is expected to take at least two years to complete.  The Company intends to finance the BioSpherix
activities through proceeds from the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary and
proceeds from possible future issuance of additional common stock.  The Company also intends to seek
pharmaceutical partners to assist in completing development of the BioSpherix
products.
Cash flow for the six
months ended June 30, 2007, reflects a net cash outflow of $2.8 million,
consisting of $2.4 million used in operating activities, $1.2 million used in
investing activities, and $768,000 provided by financing activities.  The increase in cash used by operating
activities in 2007 from that of the prior year is primarily related to the cost
of the Phase 3 clinical trial.  The
change in cash used in investing activities is related to one-time proceeds of
$2 million from the maturity of a certificate of deposit in the prior
year.  Cash flows from financing
activities in 2006 included proceeds from the issuance of warrants.

Trends
and Outlooks
BioSpherix
·                  On
June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to sell the
InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval, for $17 million ($15
million at closing and $2 million following a 15-month escrow period).  The sale will allow Spherix to focus all of
its efforts on the BioSpherix Division’s biotechnology products.
·                  BioSpherix’s
primary emphasis is on a Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate that Naturlose
is a successful treatment for Type 2 diabetes. 
The trial began in April 2007, and testing is scheduled to finish in mid-2009.  If the trial is successful, it will likely
take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application (“NDA”)
to the FDA.  The FDA will then likely
take up to a year to respond to the NDA. 
Accordingly, we do not expect FDA approval before mid-to-late 2010 at
the earliest.
·                  The
Company has decided to conduct the entire Phase 3 clinical trial for Type 2
diabetes in the United States and according has terminating the Australian
trials. The change is intended to simplify the logistics of managing the trial.
·                  Costs
of conducting the Phase 3 trial have substantially increased as we have
obtained further direction from the FDA concerning the processes to be employed
in the trial.  The Company expects to
spend up to $5 million in R&D costs over the next year.  The Company intends to use the proceeds from
the sale of the InfoSpherix subsidiary to fund the Phase 3 trial.  If the sale is not concluded, the Company will
need to reassess continuation of the tests in view of the increased costs of
the tests and the expected follow-on costs in pursuit of FDA approval.
·                  A
human clinical trial on the oral anti-plaque efficacy of Naturlose was
conducted by the Company at the University of Maryland School of
Dentistry.  The trial started in early
2007 and was completed in July.  The
Company expects to receive the results later this year.
·                  Spherix
has subsequently launched a health sciences consulting business line to provide
technical and regulatory consulting services to biotechnology and
pharmaceutical companies.
InfoSpherix
·                  As
noted above, on June 25, 2007, the Company signed a definitive purchase
agreement to sell the InfoSpherix subsidiary, subject to shareholder approval,
for $17 million ($15 million at closing and $2 million following a 15-month
escrow period).
·                  The Company
concluded the National Park Service contract on January 23, 2007.  The National Park Service contract
contributed approximately $4 million in revenue for each of the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005.  The loss of
the National Park Service contract will have an adverse effect on the Company’s
financial results in comparison to the prior year.
·                  Since 1998,
InfoSpherix has grown its government park reservation business from one
contract to 17 government reservation contracts.  InfoSpherix’s reservation business accounted
for over 60% of the Company’s revenue in 2006 and 2005, and over 50% for the
three months ended March 31, 2007. 
InfoSpherix is now one of only two major suppliers of Government
campground reservation services in the U.S.
·                  On February 6,
2007, InfoSpherix signed an agreement to lease 32,423 square feet of facility
space in Frostburg, Maryland effective December 1, 2007, for use as a call
center to replace the existing Cumberland, Maryland facility.
·                  In
August 2007, InfoSpherix signed a ten-year lease to rent 13,338 square feet of
facility space in Clarksburg, Maryland, for use as an administrative office for
InfoSpherix.  The target commencement
date for the new lease is November 1, 2007. 
In connection with the signing of the above lease, Spherix also signed a
lease termination agreement on its Beltsville facility.  Under the lease termination agreement,
Spherix will pay a termination fee of $475,000 and the termination date is to
be effective with the commencement of the Clarksburg lease.
·                  The Company will
cease to have any continuing obligations under the Frostburg, Maryland, or
Clarksburg, Maryland, leases upon completion of the sale of InfoSpherix.  The Company will relocate to a smaller
facility upon termination of the Beltsville lease.

Item 3. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The Company
manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment
opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies.
At June 30, 2007,
the Company did not have any fixed-rate or variable-rate indebtedness.  The Company has not entered into any interest
rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness.
Cash available for
investment is typically invested in short term funds, which generally mature in
30 days, or money-market funds.  In
general, such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on
such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.  The carrying amounts approximate market
value.  It is the Company’s practice to
hold these investments to maturity.
Assuming the June
30, 2007, variable rate debt and cash and cash available for investment, a
one-percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less
than $100,000.
Item 4. 
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure
Controls and Procedures.  We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports, such as this report on Form 10-Q,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. These controls and procedures are based closely
on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in
Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.  Rules adopted by
the SEC require that we present the conclusions of the Chief Executive
Officer/Chief Financial Officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly
report.
Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls.  Management, including
our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud.  In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives.  Further, the design of a control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.  Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within the Company have been detected. 
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple
error or mistake.  Additionally, controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two
or more people, or by management’s override of the control.  The design of any system of controls also is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.  Because
of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Periodic
Evaluation and Conclusion.   The Company carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management,
including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance
level.  There were no significant changes
in internal controls during the latest quarter over financial reporting that
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal
controls over financial reporting.
