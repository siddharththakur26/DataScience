and operate dallas fort worth airport dfw , a bond ordinance was enacted by both cities the bond ordinance . the bond ordinance required both cities to direct all scheduled interstate passenger operations to dfw and was an integral part of the bonds issued for the construction and operation of dfw. in 1979, as part of a settlement to resolve litigation with southwest airlines, the cities agreed to expand the scope of operations allowed under the bond ordinance at dallas' love field. congress enacted the wright amendment to prevent the federal government from acting inconsistent with this agreement. the wright amendment limited interstate operations at love field to the four states contiguous to texas new mexico, oklahoma, arkansas, and louisiana and prohibited through ticketing to any destination outside that perimeter. in 1997, without the agreement of the cities, congress amended the wright amendment by i adding three states kansas, mississippi, and alabama to the perimeter and ii removing some federal restrictions on large aircraft configured with 56 seats or fewer. from october 1997 through may 2000, american, the cities of fort worth and dallas, and other parties were involved in litigation regarding flight restrictions at love field. on may 1, 2000, american commenced service from love field to chicago and los angeles using fokker 100 aircraft reconfigured to hold 56 seats. these flights depart from terminal space leased from continental express on a short term basis. on august 31, 2000, american commenced service from love field to new york's laguardia airport using the same facilities. american is seeking long term facilities at love field from the city of dallas for its love field operations. consultants for the city of dallas are drafting a master plan for love field and expect to make recommendations to the city of dallas by the end of november 2000. as a result of the foregoing, an increase in operations at love field and or the inability of american to obtain adequate facilities to compete effectively at love field could adversely impact american's business. 12 15 industry consolidation two competitors of the company,
