ALLIS-CHALMERS ENERGY INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Allis-Chalmers”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a
multi-faceted oilfield service company that provides services and equipment to oil and natural gas
exploration and production companies, domestically in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Colorado,
Oklahoma, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas, Alabama, West Virginia, offshore in the Gulf of
Mexico, and internationally, primarily in Argentina and Mexico. We operate in six sectors of the
oil and natural gas service industry: Rental Services; International Drilling; Directional
Drilling; Tubular Services; Underbalanced Drilling; and Production Services.

We derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and
equipment required to provide a service and rates per day for equipment and tools that we rent to
our customers. The price we charge for our services depends upon several factors, including the
level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular
geographic regions in which we operate. Contracts are awarded based on price, quality of service
and equipment and general reputation and experience of our personnel. The principal operating
costs are direct and indirect labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment,
insurance, equipment rentals, fuel, depreciation and general and administrative expenses.

On October 25, 2006 our Board of Directors approved the transfer of the listing of our common stock
from the American Stock Exchange (“AMEX”) to the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Our common
stock continued to trade on the AMEX under the symbol “ALY” until the transfer was completed on
March 22, 2007, at which time we began trading on the NYSE under the symbol “ALY”.

Basis of Presentation

Our unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
Accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. We
believe that the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate to make the information not
misleading. The unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the interim
periods. These unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2006. The results of operations for the interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year.

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year’s consolidated condensed financial
statements to conform with the current period presentation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty.
Accordingly, our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. While management believes
that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements
are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but are
not limited to, determining the following: allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of
long-lived assets and intangibles, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes
and valuation allowances. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional
information is obtained and as our operating environment changes.

NOTE 1 — NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance
with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. It prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1,
2007 and such adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Our policy is that we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as
a component of income tax expense. As of the date of adoption of FIN 48, we did not have any
accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits. For United States
federal tax purposes, our tax returns for the tax years 2001 through 2006 remain open for
examination by the tax authorities. Our foreign tax returns remain open for examination for the
tax years 2001 through 2006. Generally, for state tax purposes, our 2002 through 2006 tax years
remain open for examination by the tax authorities under a four year statute of limitations,
however, certain states may keep their statute open for six to ten years.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”), which is
intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements by defining fair
value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 157
and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities (“SFAS 159”), which permits entities to elect to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value. Upon adoption of SFAS 159, an entity may elect
the fair value option for eligible items that exist at the adoption date. Subsequent to the initial
adoption, the election of the fair value option should only be made at the initial recognition of
the asset or liability or upon a re-measurement event that gives rise to the new-basis of
accounting. All subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument are reported in earnings.
SFAS No. 159 does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and
liabilities to be recorded at fair value nor does it eliminate disclosure requirements included in
other accounting standards. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity’s
first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the provisions
of SFAS 159 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.

NOTE 2 — ACQUISITIONS

In June 2007, we acquired Coker Directional, Inc. for a purchase price of approximately $3.5
million in cash and a promissory note for $350,000. Coker Directional operated in the Gulf Coast
and Central Texas regions.

NOTE 3 — SALE OF CAPILLARY ASSETS

On June 29, 2007, we sold our capillary tubing units and related equipment for approximately $16.3
million. We reported a gain of approximately $8.9 million. The assets sold represented a small
portion of our Production Services segment. Our Production Services segment will continue to
provide a variety of production-related rental tools, equipment and services.

NOTE 4 — STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

We adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. Compensation cost for awards
granted prior to, but not vested, as of January 1, 2006 would be based on the grant date attributes
originally used to value those awards for pro forma purposes under SFAS No. 123. We adopted SFAS
No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option
pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. Under the
modified prospective method, we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of
December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the
remaining vesting periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. We
estimated forfeiture rates for the first six months of 2007 and 2006 based on our historical
experience.

NOTE 4 — STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued)

The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free rate
of interest is the related U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods within the expected term of the
option at the time of grant. The dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero as we
have historically not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future. The
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock.

Our net income for the three months ended
June 30, 2007 and 2006 includes approximately $650,000
and $836,000, respectively of compensation costs related to share-based payments. Our net
income for the six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 includes approximately $1.1 million and $1.8
million, respectively of compensation costs related to share-based payments. As of June 30, 2007
there is $379,000 of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock option grants.
We expect approximately $330,000 to be recognized over the remainder of 2007, approximately
$33,000, $13,000 and $3,000 to be recognized during the years ended 2008, 2009 and 2010,
respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the
difference between the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of the second
quarter of 2007 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that
would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on
June 30, 2007. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and six months
ended June 30, 2007 was $5.1 million and $6.1 million, respectively. The total cash received from
option exercises during the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 was $2.8 million and $3.1
million, respectively.

No options were granted during the first six months of 2006 or the first three months of 2007. The

We determine the fair value of RSAs based on the market price of our common stock on the date of
grant. Compensation cost for RSAs is primarily recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting
or service period and is net of forfeitures . As of June 30, 2007, there was
approximately $2.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSAs. We
expect approximately $651,000 to be recognized over the remainder of 2007, approximately $819,000,
$520,000 and $165,000 to be recognized during the years ended 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.

NOTE 5 — INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

We compute income per common share in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per
Share. SFAS No. 128 requires companies with complex capital structures to present basic and
diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share are computed on the basis of the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share
is similar to basic earnings per share, but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of
potential common shares (e.g., convertible preferred stock, stock options, etc.) as if they had
been converted. Potential dilutive common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (e.g., those
that increase income per share) are excluded from diluted earnings per share.

The components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows (in thousands, except per
share amounts):

NOTE 6 — GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets are not permitted to be amortized. Goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets remain on the balance sheet and are tested for impairment on an
annual basis, or when there is reason to suspect that their values may have been diminished or
impaired. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets listed on the balance sheet totaled
$127.7 million and $125.8 million at June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Based on
impairment testing performed during 2006 pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 142, these assets
were not impaired.

Intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives.
Definite-lived intangible assets that continue to be amortized under SFAS No. 142 relate to our
purchase of customer-related and marketing-related intangibles. These intangibles have useful
lives ranging from five to ten years. Amortization of intangible assets for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2007 were $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, compared to $429,000
and $813,000, respectively for the same periods in the prior year. At June 30, 2007, intangible
assets totaled $31.9 million, net of $4.3 million of accumulated amortization.

NOTE 8 — DEBT (continued)

Senior notes, bank loans and line of credit agreements

On January 18, 2006 and August 14, 2006, we closed on private offerings, to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, of $160.0 and $95.0 million
aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, respectively. The senior notes are due January 15,
2014 and bear interest at 9.0%. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisitions of Specialty
Rental Tools, Inc., or Specialty, and DLS Drilling, Logistics & Services Corporation, or DLS, to
repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes.

On January 18, 2006, we also executed an amended and
restated credit agreement which provided for a
$25.0 million revolving line of credit with a maturity of January 2010. Our January 2006 amended
and restated credit agreement contained customary events of default and financial covenants and
limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay dividends or
make other distributions, create liens and sell assets. Our obligations under the January 2006
amended and restated credit agreement were secured by substantially all of our assets located in the
United States.

On December 18, 2006, we closed on a $300.0 million senior unsecured bridge loan. The bridge loan
was due 18 months after closing and bore a weighted average interest rate of 10.6%. The bridge
loan, which was repaid on January 29, 2007, was used to fund the acquisition of substantially all
of the assets of Oil & Gas Rental Services, Inc., or OGR.

In January 2007, we closed on a private offering, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, of $250.0 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due
2017. The proceeds of the senior notes offering, together with a portion of the proceeds of our
concurrent common stock offering, were used to repay the debt outstanding under our $300.0 million
bridge loan facility which we incurred to finance our acquisition of substantially all the assets
of OGR.

On April 26, 2007, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which increased
our revolving line of credit to $62.0 million, and has a final maturity date of April 26, 2012.
The amended and restated credit agreement contains customary events of default and financial
covenants and limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay
dividends or make other distributions, create liens and sell assets. Our obligations under the
amended and restated credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets located in the
United States.

As part of our acquisition of DLS, we assumed various bank loans with floating interest rates based
on LIBOR plus a margin and terms ranging from 2 to 5 years. The weighted average interest rates
were 6.71% and 7.0% at June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The bank loans are
denominated in U.S. dollars and the outstanding amounts due as of June 30, 2007 and December 31,
2006 were $6.1 million and $7.3 million, respectively.

Notes payable

As part of the acquisition of Mountain Compressed Air Inc., or Mountain Air, in 2001, we issued a
note to the sellers of Mountain Air in the original amount of $2.2 million accruing interest at a
rate of 5.75% per annum. The note was reduced to $1.5 million as a result of the settlement of a
legal action against the sellers in 2003. In March 2005, we reached an agreement with the sellers
and holders of the note as a result of an action brought against us by the sellers. Under the
terms of the agreement, we paid the holders of the note $1.0 million in cash, and agreed to pay an
additional $350,000 on June 1, 2006, and an additional $150,000 on June 1, 2007, in settlement of
all claims. At June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 the outstanding amounts due were $0 and
$150,000, respectively.

In connection with the acquisition of Rogers Oil Tool Services, Inc., or Rogers, we issued to the
seller a note in the amount of $750,000. The note bears interest at 5.0% and is due April 3, 2009.
In connection with the acquisition of Coker Directional Inc. we issued to the seller a note in the
amount of $350,000. The note bears interest at 8.25% and is due June 29, 2008.

In connection with the purchase of Safco-Oil Field Products, Inc., or Safco, we also agreed to pay
a total of $150,000 to the sellers in exchange for a non-compete agreement. We are required to
make annual payments of $50,000 through September 30, 2007. In connection with the purchase of
Capcoil Tubing Services, Inc., or Capcoil, we agreed to pay a total of $500,000 to two management
employees in exchange for non-compete agreements. We are required to make annual payments of
$110,000 through May 2008. Total amounts due under these non-compete agreements at June 30, 2007
and December 31, 2006 were $160,000 and $270,000, respectively.

NOTE 8 — DEBT (continued)

In 2000 we compensated directors, including current directors Nederlander and Toboroff, who served
on the board of directors from 1989 to March 31, 1999 without compensation, by issuing promissory
notes totaling $325,000. The notes bore interest at the rate of 5.0%. At June 30, 2007 and
December 31, 2006, the principal and accrued interest on these notes totaled approximately $32,000.

Other debt

We have various equipment and vehicle financing loans with interest rates ranging from 7.85% to
8.7% and terms of 2 to 3 years. As of June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the outstanding
balances for equipment and vehicle financing loans were $1.5 million and $3.5 million,
respectively. In April 2006 and August 2006, we obtained insurance premium financings in the
amount of $1.9 million and $896,000 with fixed interest rates of 5.6% and 6.0%, respectively.
Under terms of the agreements, amounts outstanding are paid over 10 month and 11 month repayment
schedules. In April 2007, we renewed the insurance premium financing in an amount of $3.2 million
with a fixed interest rate of 5.9% and a repayment schedule of 11 months. The outstanding balance
of these notes was approximately $2.7 million and $1.0 million as of June 30, 2007 and December 31,
2006, respectively. We also have various capital leases with terms that expire in 2008. As of
June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, amounts outstanding under capital leases were $147,000 and
$414,000, respectively.

NOTE 9 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

In January 2007 we closed on a public offering of 6.0 million shares of our common stock at a
public offering price of $17.65 per share. Net proceeds from the public offering, together with
the proceeds of our concurrent senior notes offering, were used to repay the debt outstanding under
our $300.0 million bridge loan facility, which we incurred to finance the OGR acquisition and for
general corporate purposes.

We also had options and warrants exercised in the first six months of 2007, which resulted in
534,054 shares of our common stock being issued for approximately $3.1 million. We recognized
approximately $1.1 million of compensation expense related to share based payments in the first six
months of 2007 that was recorded as capital in excess of par value (see Note 4). We also recorded
approximately $1.5 million of tax benefit related to our stock compensation plans.

NOTE 10 — CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Set forth on the following pages are the condensed consolidating financial statements of (i)
Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc., (ii) its subsidiaries that are guarantors of the senior notes and
revolving credit facility and (iii) the subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the senior notes
and revolving credit facility (in thousands, except for share and per share amounts). Prior to the
acquisition of DLS, all of our subsidiaries were guarantors of our senior notes and revolving
credit facility, the parent company had no independent assets or operations, the guarantees were
full and unconditional and joint and several.

NOTE 13 — LEGAL MATTERS

We are named from time to time in legal proceedings related to our activities prior to our
bankruptcy in 1988. However, we believe that we were discharged from liability for all such claims
in the bankruptcy and believe the likelihood of a material loss relating to any such legal
proceeding is remote.

We are also involved in various other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The
legal proceedings are at different stages; however, we believe that the likelihood of material loss
relating to any such legal proceeding is remote.

NOTE 14 — SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On July 26, 2007 we completed the acquisition of Diggar Tools, LLC, or Diggar Tools, for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $11.3 million. Diggar Tools provided down-hole motors in
the Rocky Mountains with offices in Denver, Colorado and Casper, Wyoming and will be included in
our Directional Drilling segment.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATION

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This report contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ
materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause
such differences include, but are not limited to, the general condition of the oil and natural gas
drilling industry, demand for our oil and natural gas service and rental products, and competition.
For more information on forward-looking statements please refer to the section
entitled“Forward-Looking Statements” on page 30.

Overview of Our Business

We are a multi-faceted oilfield services company that provides services and equipment to oil and
natural gas exploration and production companies, domestically in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico,
Colorado, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas, Alabama, West Virginia, offshore in the
Gulf of Mexico and internationally primarily in Argentina and Mexico. We currently operate in six
sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry: Rental Services; International Drilling;
Directional Drilling; Tubular Services; Underbalanced Drilling; and Production Services.

We derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and
equipment required to provide a service and rates per day for equipment and tools that we rent to
our customers. The price we charge for our services depends upon several factors, including the
level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular
geographic regions in which we operate. Contracts are awarded based on price, quality of service
and equipment, and the general reputation and experience of our personnel. The demand for drilling
services has historically been volatile and is affected by the capital expenditures of oil and
natural gas exploration and development companies, which can fluctuate based upon the prices of oil
and natural gas, or the expectation for the prices of oil and natural gas.

The number of working drilling rigs, typically referred to as the “rig count,” is an important
indicator of activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry. The rig count in the United
States increased from 862 as of December 31, 2002 to 1,775 on July 31, 2007 according to the Baker
Hughes rig count. Furthermore, directional and horizontal rig counts increased from 283 as of
December 31, 2002 to 795 on July 31, 2007, which accounted for 32.8% and 44.8% of the total U.S.
rig count, respectively.

Our cost of revenues represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and
maintenance of our equipment. The principal elements of these costs are direct and indirect labor
and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment, insurance, equipment rentals, fuel and
depreciation. Operating expenses do not fluctuate in direct proportion to changes in revenues
because, among other factors, we have a fixed base of inventory of equipment and facilities to
support our operations, and in periods of low drilling activity we may also seek to preserve labor
continuity to market our services and maintain our equipment.

Cyclical Nature of Equipment Rental and Services Industry

The oilfield services industry is highly cyclical. The most critical factor in assessing the
outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and
demand for natural gas. The peaks and valleys of demand are further apart than those of many other
cyclical industries. This is primarily a result of the industry being driven by commodity demand
and corresponding price increases. As demand increases, producers raise their prices. The price
escalation enables producers to increase their capital expenditures. The increased capital
expenditures ultimately result in greater revenues and profits for services and equipment
companies. The increased capital expenditures also ultimately result in greater production which
historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices.

Demand for our services has been strong for approximately the past three years beginning in
2004, due to high oil and natural gas prices and increased demand and declining production costs
for natural gas as compared to other energy sources. Management believes the current market
fundamentals are indicative of a favorable long-term trend of activity in our markets. However,
these factors could be more than offset by other developments affecting the worldwide supply and
demand for oil and natural gas products.

Results of Operations

In April 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Rogers Oil Tool Services, Inc., or
Rogers. We report the operations of Rogers in our Tubular Services segment. In August 2006, we
acquired all of the outstanding stock of DLS Drilling, Logistics & Services Corporation, or DLS,
and in December 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Tanus Argentina S.A., or Tanus.
We report the operations of DLS and Tanus in our International Drilling segment. In October 2006,
we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Petro-Rentals, Incorporated, or Petro Rentals. We
report the operations of Petro Rentals in our Production Services segment. In December 2006, we
acquired substantially all of the assets of Oil & Gas Rental Services, Inc., or OGR. We report the
operations of OGR in our Rental Services segment. We consolidated the results of these
acquisitions from the day they were acquired.

The foregoing acquisitions affect the comparability from period to period of our historical
results, and our historical results may not be indicative of our future results.

Comparison of Three Months Ended June 30, 2007 and 2006

Our revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2007 were $143.4 million, an increase of 133.6%
compared to $61.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2006. Revenues increased in all of
our business segments, except for Tubular Services, due to acquisitions completed in 2006, the
investment in new capital equipment, improved pricing and the opening of new operating locations.
The most significant increase in revenues was due to the acquisition of DLS on August 14, 2006
which expanded our operations to a sixth operating segment, International Drilling. Revenues also
increased significantly at our Rental Services segment due to the OGR acquisition on December 18,
2006.  Revenues for our Production Services
segment increased due to the acquisition of Petro Rentals on October 17, 2006 and the addition of
two coil tubing units in the fourth quarter of 2006 and one additional unit in the first quarter of
2007. Our Directional Drilling segment revenues increased in the 2007 period compared to the 2006
period due to improved pricing for directional drilling and the purchase of additional down-hole
motors and measurement-while-drilling, or MWD, tools which increased our capacity and market
presence. Revenues increased at our Underbalanced Drilling segment due to the purchase of
additional equipment, principally new compressor packages.

Our gross margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 increased 94.1% to $47.9 million, or 33.4% of
revenues, compared to $24.7 million, or 40.2%, of revenues for the three months ended June 30,
2006. The increase in gross margin is due to the increase in revenues in five of our business
segments. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the lower
gross margin that DLS achieved in the International Drilling segment. The lower margin from DLS
was partly offset by the acquisition of OGR assets on December 18, 2006, in the high margin rental
services business and the improved pricing for our services generally. Also, contributing to our
gross margin was the purchase of additional MWD tools, the acquisition of Petro Rentals, and the
addition of two coil tubing units in the fourth quarter of 2006 and one additional unit in the
first quarter of 2007. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by an increase in
depreciation expense of 220.0% to $12.2 million for the second quarter of 2007 compared to $3.8
million for the second quarter of 2006. The increase is due to additional depreciable assets
resulting from the acquisitions and capital expenditures. Our cost of revenues consists
principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of our
equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. Because many of our costs are fixed, our gross profit
as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues.

General and administrative expense was $14.3 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $8.1
million for the second quarter of 2006. General and administrative expense increased due to the
additional expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the hiring of additional sales and
administrative personnel. General and administrative expense also increased because of increased
auditing and accounting fees and other expenses in connection with initiatives to strengthen our
internal control processes, costs related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance efforts and increased
corporate accounting and administrative staff. As a percentage of revenues, general and
administrative expenses were 10.0% in the second quarter of 2007 compared to 13.3% in the second
quarter of 2006.

We adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. We adopted SFAS No. 123R using
the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model for
the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options and restricted stock. Therefore,
we recorded an expense of $650,000 and $836,000 related to stock options and restricted stock
for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The amount of option and
restricted stock expense recorded in general and administrative expense was $622,000 for the second
quarter of 2007 and $764,000 for the second quarter of 2006 with the balance being recorded as a
direct cost.

On June 29, 2007, we sold our capillary tubing assets that were part of our Production Services
segment. The total sale agreement was $16.3 million in cash. We recognized a gain of $8.9 million
related to the sale of these assets.

Amortization expense was $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $666,000 in the
second quarter of 2006. The increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of
intangible assets attained in connection with our acquisitions and the amortization of deferred
financing costs.

Income from operations for the three months ended June 30, 2007 totaled $41.0 million, a 158.1%
increase over income from operations of $15.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2006,
reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross margin, and the gain from the sale of capillary
assets, offset in part by increased general and administrative expenses and amortization. Our
income from operations as a percentage of revenues increased to 28.6% for the second quarter of
2007 from 25.9% for the second quarter of 2006, due principally to the decrease in general,
administrative and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenue.

Our interest expense was $11.3 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to $3.8 million for
the second quarter of 2006. Interest expense increased in the second quarter of 2007 due to our
increased debt. In August 2006 we issued an additional $95.0 million of senior notes bearing
interest at 9.0% to fund a portion of the acquisition of DLS. In January 2007 we issued $250.0
million of senior notes bearing interest at 8.5% to pay off, in part, the bridge loan utilized to
complete the OGR acquisition and for working capital.

Our provision for income taxes for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 was $11.3 million, or 36.7% of
our net income before income taxes, compared to $2.5 million, or 20.5% of our net income before
income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2006. The increase in income taxes is
attributable to our higher operating income and a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in the 2006 period was favorably impacted by the
reversal of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. The valuation
allowance was reversed due to operating results that allowed for the
realization of our deferred tax assets. As of January 1, 2007, no valuation
allowance remained and had no impact on the 2007 effective tax rate.

We had net income of $19.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007, an increase of 103.3%,
compared to net income of $9.6 million for the second quarter of 2006.

The following table compares revenues and income from operations for each of our business segments
and loss of income for general corporate purposes. Income (loss) from operations consists of
revenues less cost of revenues, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and
amortization:

Rental Services Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 for the Rental Services segment were $32.4 million, an
increase from $12.7 million in revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. Income from
operations increased to $14.8 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $7.3 million in the
second quarter of 2006. Our Rental Services segment revenues and operating income for the second
quarter of 2007 increased compared to the prior year due primarily to the OGR acquisition on
December 18, 2006. Income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to 45.6% for the
quarter ended June 30, 2007 compared to 57.5% for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 as a result of
higher depreciation expense associated with the OGR acquisition and capital expenditures.

International Drilling Segment

On August 14, 2006, we acquired DLS which established our International Drilling segment. Revenues
for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 for the International Drilling segment were $52.9 million and
income from operations was $10.2 million.

Directional Drilling Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 for our Directional Drilling segment were $21.3
million, an increase of 10.8% from the $19.2 million in revenues for the quarter ended June 30,
2006. Income from operations decreased 8.3% to $4.0 million for the second quarter of 2007 from
$4.4 million for the comparable 2006 period. The decrease in operating income is due to increased
expenses for downhole motor rentals and repairs along with increased labor costs. The increase in
expenses offset the increase in revenues which resulted from the purchase of an additional six MWD
tools in the second quarter of 2006 and improved pricing for our services.

Tubular Services Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 for the Tubular Services segment were $14.1 million, a
decrease of 3.5% from the $14.6 million in revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. Revenues
from domestic operations decreased to $11.9 million in the second quarter of 2007 from $13.0
million in the second quarter of 2006. Revenues from operations in Mexico were $2.2 million for
the second quarter of 2007 compared to $1.6 million for the second quarter of 2006. Income from
operations decreased 26.6% to $3.2 million in the second quarter of 2007 from $4.3 million in the
second quarter of 2006. The decrease in this segment’s revenues and operating income was due to an
increased competitive environment domestically for casing and tubing services in certain of the
geographic areas in which we operate, and decreased sales of power tongs in the second quarter of
2007 compared to the second quarter of 2006.

Underbalanced Drilling Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 for the Underbalanced Drilling segment revenues were
$13.0 million, an increase of 18.4% compared to $10.9 million in revenues for the quarter ended
June 30, 2006. Income from operations increased to $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2007
compared to income from operations of $3.2 million in the second quarter of 2006. Our
Underbalanced Drilling segment revenues and operating income for the second quarter of 2007
increased compared to the second quarter of 2006 primarily due to our investment in additional
equipment.

Production Services Segment

Revenues were $9.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 for the Production Services segment,
an increase of 149.1% compared to $3.9 million in revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2006.
Income from operations increased to $9.9 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $341,000
in the second quarter of 2006. Our Production Services segment revenues and operating income for
the second quarter of 2007 increased compared to the second quarter of 2006 due primarily to our
acquisition of Petro Rentals on October 17, 2006, the gain from the sale of capillary assets and
the addition of two coil tubing units in the fourth quarter of 2006 and one additional unit in the
first quarter of 2007.

General Corporate

General corporate expenses increased $1.0 million to $4.6 million for the quarter ended June 30,
2007 compared to $3.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. The increase was due to the
increase in payroll costs and benefits for additional management, accounting and administrative
staff as a result of the acquisitions and to support our growing organization, increased franchise
taxes based on our increased authorized shares and increased audit fees and professional services
related to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance effort.

Comparison of Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 and 2006

Our revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2007 were $279.3 million, an increase of 155.5%
compared to $109.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006. Revenues increased in all of
our business segments due to acquisitions completed in 2006, the investment in new capital
equipment, improved pricing and the opening of new operating locations. The most significant
increase in revenues was due to the acquisition of DLS on August 14, 2006, which expanded our
operations to a sixth operating segment, International Drilling. Revenues also increased
significantly at our Rental Services segment due to the OGR acquisition on December 18, 2006.
Revenues for our Production Services segment increased due to the acquisition of Petro Rentals on
October 17, 2006 and the addition of two coil tubing units in the fourth quarter of 2006 and one in
the first quarter of 2007. Our Directional Drilling segment revenues increased in the 2007 period
compared to the 2006 period due to improved pricing for directional drilling and the purchase of
additional down-hole motors and MWD tools which increased our capacity and market presence. Our
Tubular Services segment also had a substantial increase in revenue, primarily due to the
acquisition of Rogers as of April 3, 2006 and the purchase of additional equipment. Revenues
increased at our Underbalanced Drilling segment due to the purchase of additional equipment,
principally new compressor packages.

Our gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2007 increased 128.7% to $94.4 million, or 33.8%
of revenues, compared to $41.3 million, or 37.8% of revenues for the six months ended June 30,
2006. The increase in gross margin is due to the increase in revenues in all of our business
segments. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the lower
gross margin that DLS achieved in the International Drilling segment. The lower margin from DLS
was partly offset by the acquisition of OGR assets on December 18, 2006, in the high margin rental
services business and the improved pricing for our services generally. Also, contributing to our
gross margin was the purchase of additional MWD tools, the acquisition of Rogers and Petro Rentals,
and the addition of two coil tubing units in the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase in gross
margin was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of 236.2% to $24.1 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2007 compared to $7.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006.
The increase is due to additional depreciable assets resulting from the acquisitions and capital
expenditures. Our cost of revenues consists principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment
rentals, maintenance and repairs of our equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. Because many
of our costs are fixed, our gross margin as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our
level of revenues.

General and administrative expense was $28.3 million in the first six months of 2007 compared to
$15.5 million for the first six months of 2006. General and administrative expense increased due
to the additional expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the hiring of additional sales and
administrative personnel. General and administrative expense also increased because of increased
accounting fees and other expenses in connection with initiatives to strengthen our internal
control processes, costs related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance efforts and increased corporate
accounting and administrative staff. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative
expenses were 10.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2007 compared to 14.2% in the same period of
2006.

We adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. We adopted SFAS No. 123R using
the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model for
the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options and restricted stock. Therefore,
we recorded an expense of $1.1 million and $1.8 million related to stock options and restricted
stock for the six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The amount of option and
restricted stock expense recorded in general and administrative expense was $1.0 million for the
first six months of 2007 and $1.6 million for the first six months of 2006 with the balance being
recorded as a direct cost.

On June 29, 2007, we sold our capillary tubing assets that were part of our Production Services
segment. The total sale agreement was $16.3 million in cash. We recognized a gain of $8.9 million
related to the sale of these assets.

Amortization expense was $3.0 million in the first six months of 2007 compared to $1.3 million in
the first six months of 2006. The increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of
intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions and the amortization of deferred financing
costs.

Table of Contents

Income from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2007 totaled $72.0 million, a 193.8%
increase over income from operations of $24.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006,
reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross margin, the gain from the sale of assets, offset
in part by increased general and administrative expenses and amortization. Our income from
operations as a percentage of revenues increased to 25.8% for the first six months of 2007 from
22.4% for the first six months of 2006, due principally to the decrease in general, administrative
and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenue and the gain from the sale of assets.

Our interest expense was $24.9 million in the first six months of 2007, compared to $7.6 million
for the first six months of 2006. Interest expense increased in the first six months of 2007,
compared to the first six months of 2006, due to our increased debt. In August 2006 we issued an
additional $95.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at 9.0% to fund a portion of the
acquisition of DLS. In January 2007 we issued $250.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at
8.5% to pay off, in part, the bridge loan utilized to complete the OGR acquisition and for working
capital. The bridge loan was outstanding until January 29, 2007 and had an average interest rate
of 10.6%. Interest expense for the first six months of 2007 includes the write-off of deferred
financing fees of $1.2 million related to the repayment of the bridge loan.

Our provision for income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was $17.6 million, or 35.7%
of our net income before income taxes, compared to $3.1 million, or 18.0% of our net income before
income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2006. The increase in income taxes is attributable
to our higher operating income and a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in the 2006 period was favorably impacted by the
reversal of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. The valuation
allowance was reversed due to operating results that allowed for the
realization of our deferred tax assets. As of January 1, 2007, no valuation
allowance remained and had no impact on the 2007 effective tax rate.

We had net income of $31.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007, an increase of 125.9%,
compared to net income of $14.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006.

The following table compares revenues and income from operations for each of our business segments
and loss of income for general corporate purposes. Income (loss) from operations consists of

Rental Services Segment

Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2007 for the Rental Services segment were $64.0 million,
an increase from $23.1 million in revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2006. Income from
operations increased to $28.7 million in the first six months of 2007 compared to $12.3 million in
the first six months of 2006. Our Rental Services segment revenues and operating income for the
first six months of 2007 increased compared to the prior year due primarily to the OGR acquisition
on December 18, 2006. Income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to 44.9% for
the six months ended June 30, 2007 compared to 53.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2006 as a
result of higher depreciation expense associated with the OGR acquisition and capital expenditures.

International Drilling Segment

On August 14, 2006, we acquired DLS which established our International Drilling segment. Revenues
for the six months ended June 30, 2007 for the International Drilling segment were $101.8 million
and the income from operations was $19.8 million.

Directional Drilling Segment

Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2007 for our Directional Drilling segment were $41.8
million, an increase of 18.9% from the $35.2 million in revenues for the six months ended June 30,
2006. Income from operations increased 18.9% to $8.3 million for the first six months of 2007 from
$7.0 million for the comparable 2006 period. The improved results for this segment are due to
improved pricing for directional and horizontal drilling and the purchase of an additional six MWD
tools offset in part by increased expenses for the downhole motor rentals and repairs and increased
labor costs.

Tubular Services Segment

Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2007 for the Tubular Services segment were $28.5
million, an increase of 18.4% from the $24.0 million in revenues for the six months ended June 30,
2006. Revenues from domestic operations increased to $24.5 million in the first six months of 2007
from $20.8 million in the first six months of 2006 as a result of the acquisition of Rogers.
Revenues from operations in Mexico were $4.0 million for the first six months of 2007 and $3.2
million for the first six months of 2006. Income from operations increased 3.2% to $6.4 million in
the first six months of 2007 from $6.2 million in the first six months of 2006. The increase in
this segment’s operating income was due to our increased revenues from our operations in Mexico.

Underbalanced Drilling Segment

Our Underbalanced Drilling segment revenues were $23.5 million for the six months ended June 30,
2007, an increase of 17.3% compared to $20.0 million in revenues for the six months ended June 30,
2006. Income from operations increased to $6.1 million in the first six months of 2007 compared to
income from operations of $5.4 million in the first six months of 2006. Our Underbalanced Drilling
segment revenues and operating income for the first six months of 2007 increased compared to the
first six months of 2006 primarily due to our investment in additional equipment.

Production Services Segment

Revenues were $19.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007 for the Production Services
segment, an increase of 185.8% compared to $6.9 million in revenues for the six months ended June
30, 2006. Income from operations increased to $11.5 million in the first six months of 2007
compared to $618,000 in the first six months of 2006. Our Production Services segment revenues and
operating income for the first six months of 2007 increased compared to the first six months of
2006 due primarily to our acquisition of Petro Rentals on October 17, 2006, the gain from the sale
of capillary assets and the addition of two coil tubing units in the fourth quarter of 2006 and one
additional unit in the first quarter of 2007.

General Corporate

General corporate expenses increased $1.8 million to $8.8 million for the six months ended June 30,
2007 compared to $7.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006. The increase was due to the
increase in payroll costs and benefits for additional management, accounting and administrative
staff as a result of the acquisitions and to support our growing organization, increased franchise
taxes based on our increased authorized shares and increased audit fees and professional services
related to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance effort.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our on-going capital requirements arise primarily from our need to service our debt, to complete
acquisitions, to acquire and maintain equipment, and to fund our working capital requirements. Our
primary sources of liquidity are proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities and cash
flows from operations. We had cash and cash equivalents of $106.8 million at June 30, 2007
compared to $39.7 million at December 31, 2006.

Operating Activities

In the six months ended June 30, 2007, our operating activities provided $56.4 million in cash.
Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was $31.7 million. Non-cash expenses totaled
$27.5 million during the first six months of 2007 consisting of $27.0 million of depreciation and
amortization, $6.7 million for deferred taxes related to timing differences, $1.2 million for the
write-off of loan fees related to the bridge loan that was repaid, $1.1 million from the expensing
of stock options, $279,000 from increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivables, less
$8.9 million on the gain from asset disposals.

During the six months ended June 30, 2007, changes in operating assets and liabilities used $2.8
million in cash, principally due to an increase of $25.5 million in accounts receivable, an
increase of $3.8 million in inventory, offset in part by a decrease in other current assets of $9.5
million, an increase of $4.0 million in accounts payable, an increase of $7.9 million in accrued
interest, an increase of $3.0 million in accrued expenses and an increase in accrued salaries,
benefits and payroll taxes of $2.1 million. Accounts receivable increased primarily due to the
increase in our revenues in the first six months of 2007. Other inventory increased primarily due
to the build-up of inventory to meet the demands of increased activity levels in our International
Drilling segment. The decrease in other current assets is principally due to the collection of the
working capital adjustment from the OGR acquisition for approximately $7.1 million in the first
quarter of 2007. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued salaries, benefits
and payroll taxes is attributed to additional expenses related to higher activity levels. The
increase in accrued interest is due to the semi-annual payment of interest on our 9.0% senior notes
due in July 2007.

In the six months ended June 30, 2006, our operating activities provided $17.0 million in cash.
Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was $14.0 million. Non-cash additions to net
income totaled $11.0 million during the first six months of 2006 consisting of $8.4 million of
depreciation and amortization, $1.8 million from the expensing of stock options, $355,000 of
imputed interest related to the effective date of the Specialty Rental Tools, Inc., or Specialty,
acquisition, $279,000 related to increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivables and
$119,000 on the loss from asset disposals.

During the six months ended June 30, 2006, changes in operating assets and liabilities used $8.0
million in cash, principally due to an increase of $13.6 million in accounts receivable, an
increase of $1.5 million in inventory, a decrease of $1.5 million in accounts payable, offset in
part by an increase of $6.4 million in accrued interest and an increase of $1.8 million in accrued
expenses. Accounts receivable increased from the December 31, 2005 level, due to the increase in
our revenues in the first six months of 2006, which is primarily attributable to the Specialty
acquisition. Inventory increased primarily due to the build-up of inventory to meet the demands of
our increased activity levels. The increase in accrued interest relates to the interest on our
9.0% senior notes that is only paid semi-annually. The increase in accrued expenses can be
attributed to additional income tax liability due to profitability and additional expenses related
to higher activity levels.

Investing Activities

During the six months ended June 30, 2007, we used $31.2 million in investing activities,
consisting of $47.2 million for capital expenditures, $3.6 million for business acquisition and
$440,000 for investment in oilfield prospects, offset by $19.9 million of proceeds from asset
sales. Included in the $47.2 million for capital expenditures was $18.9 million for drill pipe and
other equipment used in our Rental Services segment, $5.9 million primarily for additional MWD
equipment used in the Directional Drilling segment, $5.9 million for additional equipment in our
International Drilling segment, $4.8 million for our Tubular Services segment and $6.5 million for
our Underbalanced Drilling segment, principally new compressor packages. We received proceeds of
$16.3 million from the sale of our capillary assets and $3.7 million from the proceeds from asset
sales in connection with items “lost in hole” by our customers or other asset sales.

During the six months ended June 30, 2006, we used $119.0 million in investing activities,
consisting of $95.8 million for the acquisition of Specialty, net of cash received, $10.7 million
for the acquisition of Rogers, net of cash received and $14.2 million for capital expenditures,
offset by $1.8 million of proceeds from equipment sales. Included in the $14.2 million for capital
expenditures was $5.5 million for equipment used in our Tubular Services segment, $3.0 million for
the expansion of our MWD equipment used in the Directional Drilling segment and $3.0 million for
additional equipment in our Underbalanced Drilling segment. A majority of our equipment sales
relate to items “lost in hole” by our customers.

Financing Activities

During the six months ended June 30, 2007, financing activities provided $41.9 million in cash. We
received $250.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt, repaid $305.2 million in borrowings under
long-term debt facilities, including the repayment of the bridge loan, and paid $7.6 million in
debt issuance costs. We also received $100.1 million from the issuance of our common stock in a
public offering, net of expenses along with $3.1 million in proceeds from the exercise of options
and warrants. We recognized a tax benefit of $1.5 million related to our stock compensation plans.

During the six months ended June 30, 2006, financing activities provided a net of $106.3 million in
cash. We received $161.4 million in proceeds from long-term debt, repaid $45.3 million in
borrowings under long-term facilities, repaid $3.0 million in related party debt, repaid $6.4
million under our line of credit and paid $5.3 million in debt issuance costs. We also received
$5.0 million in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants. On January 18, 2006, we closed
on a private offering of $160.0 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes. The notes
are due January 15, 2014 and bear interest at 9.0%. The proceeds from the sale of the notes were
used to fund the acquisition of Specialty.

At June 30, 2007, we had $516.7 million in outstanding indebtedness, of which $509.5 million was
long term debt and $7.2 million is due within one year.

On January 18, 2006 and August 14, 2006, we closed on private offerings, to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, of $160.0 and $95.0 million
aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, respectively. The senior notes are due January 15,
2014 and bear interest at 9.0%. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisitions of Specialty
and DLS to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes.

On January 18, 2006, we also executed an amended and restated credit agreement which provide for a
$25.0 million revolving line of credit with a maturity of January 2010. Our January 2006 amended
and restated credit agreement contain customary events of default and financial covenants and
limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay dividends or
make other distributions, create liens and sell assets. Our obligations under the January 2006
amended and restated credit agreement were secured by substantially all of our assets located in the
United States.

On December 18, 2006, we closed on a $300.0 million senior unsecured bridge loan. The bridge loan
was due 18 months after closing and bore a weighted average interest rate of 10.6%. The bridge
loan, which was repaid on January 29, 2007, was used to fund the acquisition of substantially all
of the assets of OGR.

In January 2007, we closed on a private offering, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, of $250.0 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due
2017. The proceeds of the senior notes offering, together with a portion of the proceeds of our
concurrent common stock offering, were used to repay the debt outstanding under our $300.0 million
bridge loan facility which we incurred to finance our acquisition of substantially all the assets
of OGR.

On April 26, 2007, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which increased
our revolving line of credit to $62.0 million, and has a final maturity date of April 26, 2012.
The amended and restated credit agreement contains customary events of default and financial
covenants and limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay
dividends or make other distributions, create liens and sell assets. Our obligations under the
amended and restated credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets located in the
United States.

As part of our acquisition of DLS, we assumed various bank loans with floating interest rates based
on LIBOR plus a margin and terms ranging from 2 to 5 years. The weighted average interest rates
were 6.71% and 7.0% at June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The bank loans are
denominated in U.S. dollars and the outstanding amounts due as of June 30, 2007 and December 31,
2006 were $6.1 million and $7.3 million, respectively.

As part of the acquisition of Mountain Compressed Air Inc., or Mountain Air, in 2001, we issued a
note to the sellers of Mountain Air in the original amount of $2.2 million accruing interest at a
rate of 5.75% per annum. The note was reduced to $1.5 million as a result of the settlement of a
legal action against the sellers in 2003. In March 2005, we reached an agreement with the sellers
and holders of the note as a result of an action brought against us by the sellers. Under the
terms of the agreement, we paid the holders of the note $1.0 million in cash, and agreed to pay an
additional $350,000 on June 1, 2006, and an additional $150,000 on June 1, 2007, in settlement of
all claims. At June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 the outstanding amounts due were $0 and
$150,000, respectively.

Table of Contents

In connection with the acquisition of Rogers Oil Tool Services, Inc., or Rogers, we issued to the
seller a note in the amount of $750,000. The note bears interest at 5.0% and is due April 3, 2009.
In connection with the acquisition of Coker Directional Inc., we issued to the seller a note in the
amount of $350,000. The note bears interest at 8.25% and is due June 29, 2008.

In connection with the purchase of Safco-Oil Field Products, Inc., or Safco, we also agreed to pay
a total of $150,000 to the sellers in exchange for a non-compete agreement. We are required to
make annual payments of $50,000 through September 30, 2007. In connection with the purchase of
Capcoil Tubing Services, Inc., or Capcoil, we agreed to pay a total of $500,000 to two management
employees in exchange for non-compete agreements. We are required to make annual payments of
$110,000 through May 2008. Total amounts due under these non-compete agreements at June 30, 2007
and December 31, 2006 were $160,000 and $270,000, respectively.

In 2000 we compensated directors, including current directors Nederlander and Toboroff, who served
on the board of directors from 1989 to March 31, 1999 without compensation, by issuing promissory
notes totaling $325,000. The notes bore interest at the rate of 5.0%. At June 30 2007 and
December 31, 2006, the principal and accrued interest on these notes totaled approximately $32,000.
We have various equipment and vehicle financing loans with interest rates ranging from 7.85% to
8.7% and terms of 2 to 3 years. As of June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the outstanding
balances for equipment and vehicle financing loans were $1.5 million and $3.5 million,
respectively. In April 2006 and August 2006, we obtained insurance premium financings in the
amount of $1.9 million and $896,000 with fixed interest rates of 5.6% and 6.0%, respectively.
Under terms of the agreements, amounts outstanding are paid over 10 month and 11 month repayment
schedules. In April 2007, we renewed the insurance premium financing in an amount of $3.2 million
with a fixed interest rate of 5.9% and a repayment schedule of 11 months. The outstanding balance
of these notes was approximately $2.7 million and $1.0 million as of June 30, 2007 and December 31,
2006, respectively. We also have various capital leases with terms that expire in 2008. As of
June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, amounts outstanding under capital leases were $147,000 and
$414,000, respectively.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off balance sheet arrangements, other than normal operating leases and employee
contracts, that have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources. We do not guarantee obligations of any unconsolidated
entities. At June 30, 2007, we had a $62.0 million revolving line of credit with a maturity of
April 2012. At June 30, 2007, no amounts were borrowed on the facility but availability is reduced
by outstanding letters of credit of $8.8 million.

Capital Requirements

We have identified capital expenditure projects that will require approximately $75.0 million for
the remainder of 2007, exclusive of any acquisitions. We believe that our current cash generated
from operations, cash available under our credit facilities and cash on hand will provide
sufficient funds for our identified projects.

We intend to implement a growth strategy of increasing the scope of services through both internal
growth and acquisitions. We are regularly involved in discussions with a number of potential
acquisition candidates. The acquisition of assets could require additional financing. We also
expect to make capital expenditures to acquire and to maintain our existing equipment. Our
performance and cash flow from operations will be determined by the demand for our services which
in turn are affected by our customers’ expenditures for oil and gas exploration and development,
and industry perceptions and expectations of future oil and natural gas prices in the areas where
we operate. We will need to refinance our existing debt facilities as they become due and provide
funds for capital expenditures and acquisitions. To effect our expansion plans, we may require
additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in
raising the additional debt or equity capital or that we can do so on terms that will be acceptable
to us.

Recent Developments

On July 26, 2007 we completed the acquisition of Diggar Tools, LLC, or Diggar Tools, for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $11.3 million. Diggar Tools provided down-hole motors
- -in the Rocky Mountains with offices in Denver, Colorado and Casper, Wyoming and will be included
in our Directional Drilling segment.

Critical Accounting Policies

Please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 for a description of
other policies that are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of
operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business
operations is discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. No
material changes to such information have occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2007.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance
with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. It prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1,
2007 and such adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Our policy is that we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as
a component of income tax expense. As of the date of adoption of FIN 48, we did not have any
accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits. For United States
federal tax purposes, our tax returns for the tax years 2001 through 2006 remain open for
examination by the tax authorities. Our foreign tax returns remain open for examination for the
tax years 2001 through 2006. Generally, for state tax purposes, our 2002 through 2006 tax years
remain open for examination by the tax authorities under a four year statute of limitations,
however, certain states may keep their statute open for six to ten years.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”), which is
intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements by defining fair
value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 157
and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities (“SFAS 159”), which permits entities to elect to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value. Upon adoption of SFAS 159, an entity may elect
the fair value option for eligible items that exist at the adoption date. Subsequent to the initial
adoption, the election of the fair value option should only be made at the initial recognition of
the asset or liability or upon a re-measurement event that gives rise to the new-basis of
accounting. All subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument are reported in earnings.
SFAS No. 159 does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and
liabilities to be recorded at fair value nor does it eliminate disclosure requirements included in
other accounting standards. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity’s
first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the provisions
of SFAS 159 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, regarding our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends,
plans, believes, seeks, estimates and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. However, these are not the exclusive means of identifying
forward-looking statements. Although such forward-looking statements reflect our good faith
judgment, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known to us.
Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and
actual outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the
forward-looking statements. Further information about the risks and uncertainties that may impact
us are described under “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2006. You should read those sections carefully. You should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this quarterly report. We
undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any
event or circumstance occurring after the date of this quarterly report or currently unknown facts
or conditions or the occurrence of unanticipated events.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency
exchange risks.

Interest Rate Risk.

Fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable
rate debt obligations expose us to market risk. We are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in
interest rates affecting our adjustable rate debt, and any future refinancing of our fixed rate
debt and our future debt.

As part of our acquisition of DLS, we assumed various bank loans carrying variable interest rates
with an outstanding balance of $6.1 million as of June 30, 2007.

We have also been subject to interest rate market risk for short-term invested cash and cash
equivalents. The principal of such invested funds would not be subject to fluctuating value
because of their highly liquid short-term nature. As of June 30, 2007, we had $82.6 million
invested in short-term investments.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.

We have designated the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for our operations in international
locations as we contract with customers, purchase equipment and finance capital using the U.S.
dollar. Local currency transaction gains and losses, arising from remeasurement of certain assets
and liabilities denominated in local currency, are included in our consolidated statements of
income. We conduct business in Mexico through our Mexican partner, Matyep. This business exposes
us to foreign exchange risk. To control this risk, we provide for payment in U.S. dollars.
However, we have historically provided our partner a discount upon payment equal to 50% of any loss
suffered by our partner as a result of devaluation of the Mexican peso between the date of
invoicing and the date of payment. To date, such payments have not been material in amount.




ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we have evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e)
and 15d — 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the “Exchange Act”. This
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based on this evaluation, these
officers have concluded that, as of June 30, 2007, our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed
by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules and
forms.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures.

(b) Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 30,
2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting:
