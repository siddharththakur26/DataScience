analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected historical financial data and our accompanying financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this document. the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed under item 1a. risk factors. 32 table of contents overview of our business we are a multi faceted oilfield services company that provides services and equipment to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, domestically in texas, louisiana, new mexico, colorado, oklahoma, mississippi, utah, wyoming, arkansas, alabama, west virginia, offshore in the gulf of mexico, and internationally, primarily in argentina and mexico. we operate in six sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry rental tools, international drilling, directional drilling services casing and tubing services compressed air drilling services and production services. we derive operating revenues from rates per job that we charge for the labor and equipment required to provide a service and rates per day for equipment and tools that we rent to our customers. the price we charge for our services depends upon several factors, including the level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular geographic regions in which we operate. contracts are awarded based on the price, quality of service and equipment, and the general reputation and experience of our personnel. the demand for drilling services has historically been volatile and is affected by the capital expenditures of oil and natural gas exploration and development companies, which can fluctuate based upon the prices of oil and natural gas or the expectation for the prices of oil and natural gas. the number of working drilling rigs, typically referred to as the rig count, is an important indicator of activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry. the rig count in the united states increased from 862 as of december 31, 2002 to 1,752 as of march 2, 2007, according to the baker hughes rig count. furthermore, directional and horizontal rig counts increased from 283 as of december 31, 2002 to 738 as of march 2, 2007, which accounted for 33 and 42 of the total u.s. rig count, respectively. our cost of revenues represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our equipment. the principal elements of these costs are direct and indirect labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment, insurance, equipment rentals, fuel and depreciation. operating expenses do not fluctuate in direct proportion to changes in revenues because, among other factors, we have a fixed base of inventory of equipment and facilities to support our operations, and in periods of low drilling activity we may also seek to preserve labor continuity to market our services and maintain our equipment. cyclical nature of equipment rental and services industry the oilfield services industry is highly cyclical. the most critical factor in assessing the outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas. the peaks and valleys of demand are further apart than those of many other cyclical industries. this is primarily a result of the industry being driven by commodity demand and corresponding price increases. as demand increases, producers raise their prices. the price escalation enables producers to increase their capital expenditures. the increased capital expenditures ultimately result in greater revenues and profits for services and equipment companies. the increased capital expenditures also ultimately result in greater production which historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices. demand for our services has been strong throughout 2004, 2005 and 2006 due to high oil and natural gas prices and increased demand and declining production costs for natural gas as compared to other energy sources. management believes the current market fundamentals are indicative of a favorable long term trend of activity in our markets. however, these factors could be more than offset by other developments affecting the worldwide supply and demand for oil and natural gas products. restatement we understated diluted earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted shares outstanding for each of the first three quarters of 2004, for the year ended december 31, 2004 and for the quarter ended march 31, 2005. in addition, we understated basic earnings per share due to an incorrect calculation of our weighted average basic shares outstanding for the quarter ended september 30, 2004. consequently, we restated our financial statements for each of those periods. the incorrect calculation resulted from a mathematical error and an improper application of statement of financial accounting standards no. 128, earnings per share , or sfas, no. 128. the effect of the restatement was to reduce weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the relevant periods and to reduce weighted average basic shares 33 table of contents outstanding for the quarter ended september 30, 2004. therefore, diluted earnings per share were increased for the relevant periods and basic earnings per share were increased for the quarter ended september 30, 2004. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december 31, 2006 . in connection with the formation of aircomp in 2003, we, along with m i contributed assets to aircomp in exchange for a 55 interest and 45 interest, respectively, in aircomp. we originally accounted for the formation of aircomp as a joint venture, but in february 2005 determined that the transaction should have been accounted for using purchase accounting pursuant to sfas no. 141, business combinations and sec staff accounting bulletin no. 51 accounting for sales of stock by a subsidiary. consequently, we restated our financial statements for the first three quarters of 2004 see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december 31, 2006 . results of operations in september 2004, we acquired the remaining 19 of tubular and we acquired safco. in november 2004, aircomp acquired substantially all of the assets of diamond air and, in december 2004, we acquired downhole. we consolidated the results of these acquisitions from the day they were acquired. in april 2005, we acquired delta and, in may 2005, we acquired capcoil. we report the operations of downhole and capcoil as our production services segment and the operations of safco and delta as our rental tools segment. in july 2005, we acquired the 45 interest of m i in our compressed air drilling subsidiary, aircomp, making us the 100 owner of aircomp. in addition, in july 2005, we acquired the compressed air drilling assets of w. t. on august 1, 2005, we acquired 100 of the outstanding capital stock of target. the results of target are included in our directional drilling segment as their measurement while drilling equipment is utilized in that segment. on september 1, 2005, we acquired the casing and tubing service assets of patterson services, inc. we consolidated the results of these acquisitions from the day they were acquired. in january 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of specialty and in december 2006, we acquired substantially all of the assets of ogr. we report the operations of specialty and ogr in our rental tool segment. in april 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of rogers. we report the operations of rogers in our casing and tubing services segment. in august 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of dls and in december 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of tanus. we report the operations of dls and tanus in our international drilling segment. in october 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of petro rentals. we report the operations of petro rentals in our production services segment. we consolidated the results of these acquisitions from the day they were acquired. the foregoing acquisitions affect the comparability from period to period of our historical results, and our historical results may not be indicative of our future results. comparison of years ended december 31, 2006 and december 31, 2005 our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006 was 307.3 million, an increase of 191.7 compared to 105.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. revenues increased in all of our business segments due to the successful integration of acquisitions completed in the third quarter of 2005 and during 2006, the investment in new equipment, improved pricing for our services, the addition of operations and sales personnel and the opening of new operations offices. revenues increased most significantly due to the acquisition of dls on august 14, 2006 which expanded our operations to a sixth operating segment, international drilling. revenues also increased significantly at our rental tools segment due to the acquisition of specialty effective january 1, 2006. our casing and tubing services segment also had a substantial increase in revenue, primarily due to the acquisitions of the casing and tubing assets of patterson services, inc. on september 1, 2005, and the acquisition of rogers as of april 1, 2006, along with the investment in additional equipment, improved market conditions and increased market penetration for our services in south texas, east texas, louisiana and the u.s. gulf of mexico. revenues increased at our compressed air drilling segment due to the purchase of additional equipment and improved pricing for our services. our directional drilling services segment revenues increased in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period due to improved pricing for directional drilling services, the august 2005 acquisition of target which provides measurement while drilling tools, or mwd and the purchase of additional down hole motors and mwds which increased our capacity and market presence. 34 table of contents our gross margin for the year ended december 31, 2006 increased 243.8 to 105.1 million, or 34.2 of revenues, compared to 30.6 million, or 29.0 , of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in revenues in all of our business segments. the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the acquisition of specialty as of january 1, 2006, in the high margin rental tool business, the improved pricing for our services generally and the investments in new capital equipment. also contributing to our improved gross profit margin was the acquisition of target, the purchase of additional mwd s and the acquisition of rogers. the increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of 315.7 to 20.3 million compared to 4.9 million for 2005. the increase is due to additional depreciable assets resulting from the acquisitions and capital expenditures. our cost of revenues consists principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of our equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. because many of our costs are fixed, our gross profit as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues. general and administrative expense was 35.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2006 compared to 15.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. general and administrative expense increased due to additional expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the hiring of additional sales, operations and administrative personnel. general and administrative expense also increased because of increased accounting and consulting fees and other expenses in connection with initiatives to strengthen our internal control processes, costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and increased corporate accounting and administrative staff. as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 11.6 in 2006 compared to 14.8 in 2005. we adopted sfas no. 123r, share based payment, effective january 1, 2006. this statement requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. we adopted sfas no. 123r using the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the black scholes option pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. under the modified prospective method, we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of december 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining vesting periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. therefore, we recorded an expense of 3.4 million related to stock awards for the year ended december 31, 2006 of which 3.0 million was recorded in general and administrative expense with the balance being recorded as a direct cost. prior to january 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock based compensation using accounting principle board opinion no. 25, or apb no. 25. under apb no. 25, compensation expense is recognized for stock options with an exercise price that is less than the market price on the grant date of the option. accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized under apb no. 25. amortization expense was 2.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2006 compared to 1.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions and the amortization of deferred financing costs which included approximately 1.1 million. income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2006 totaled 66.7 million, a 404.3 increase over the 13.2 million in income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2005, reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross profit, offset in part by increased general and administrative expenses. our income from operations as a percentage of revenues increased to 21.7 in 2006 from 12.5 in 2005 due to the increase in our gross margin which offset the increases in amortization expense and general and administrative expenses. our net interest expense was 19.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, compared to 4.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. interest expense increased in 2006 due to our increased debt. in january of 2006 we issued 160.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at 9.0 to fund the acquisition of specialty, pay off other outstanding debt and for working capital. in august 2006 we issued an additional 95.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at 9.0 to fund a portion of the acquisition of dls. on december 18, 2006, we borrowed 300.0 million in a senior unsecured bridge loan to fund the acquisition of ogr. the average interest rate on the bridge loan was approximately 10.6 . interest expense for 2006 includes the write off of 453,000 related to financing fees on the bridge loan. this bridge loan was repaid on 35 table of contents january 29, 2007 and the remaining 1.2 million of financing fees will be written off in 2007. in the third quarter of 2005, we incurred debt retirement expense of 1.1 million related to the refinancing of our debt. this amount includes prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred financing fees from a previous financing. minority interest in income of subsidiaries for the year ended december 31, 2006 was 0 compared to 488,000 for the corresponding period in 2005 due to the our acquisition of the minority interest at aircomp on july 11, 2005. our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2006 was 11.4 million, or 24.3 of our net income before income taxes, compared to 1.3 million, or 15.8 of our net income before income taxes for 2005. the increase in our provision for income taxes is attributable to the significant increase in our operating income which resulted in the utilization of our deferred tax assets including our net operating losses, and the increase in percentage of income taxes to net income before income taxes attributable to our operations in argentina which are taxed at 35.0 . we had net income attributed to common stockholders of 35.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of 396.5 , compared to net income attributed to common stockholders of 7.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the following table compares revenues and income from operations for each of our business segments for the years ended december 31, 2006 and december 31, 2005. income from operations consists of our revenues less cost of revenues, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization revenues income loss from operations 2006 2005 change 2006 2005 change in thousands rental tools 51,521 5,059 46,462 26,293 1,300 24,993

from operations increased to 26.3 million in 2006 compared to 1.3 million in 2005. the increase in revenue and operating income is primarily attributable to the acquisition of specialty effective january 1, 2006, improved pricing, improved utilization of our inventory of rental equipment and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of the ogr assets in december 2006. international drilling segment. our international drilling revenues were 69.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, and our income from operations was 12.2 million. this segment of our operations was created with the acquisition of dls in august of 2006. in november 2006, our dls employees were involved in a ten day labor strike in argentina, which affected the entire oil industry in argentina and had a negative impact on our results. directional drilling services segment. revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006 for our directional drilling services segment were 72.8 million, an increase of 65.9 from the 43.9 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2005. income from operations increased 139.1 to 17.7 million for 2006 from 7.4 million for 2005. the improved results for this segment are due to the increase in drilling activity in the texas and gulf coast areas, improved pricing, the acquisition of target as of august 1, 2005 36 table of contents and the purchase of an additional six mwds. our increased operating expenses as a result of the addition of operations and personnel were more than offset by the growth in revenues and improved pricing for our services casing and tubing services segment. revenues for the year ended december 31, 2006 for the casing and tubing services segment were 50.9 million, an increase of 143.1 from the 20.9 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2005. revenues from domestic operations increased to 44.4 million in 2006 from 14.5 million in 2005 as a result of the acquisition of rogers, the acquisition of the casing and tubing assets of patterson services, inc. on september 1, 2005 and investment in new equipment, all of which resulted in increased market penetration for our services in south texas, east texas, louisiana and the u.s. gulf of mexico. the year ended december 2005 was also adversely impacted by hurricane activity in september of 2005. revenues from mexican operations increased to 6.5 million in 2006 from 6.4 million in 2005. income from operations increased 151.2 to 12.5 million in 2006 from 5.0 million in 2005. the increase in this segment s operating income is due to increased revenues both domestically and in our mexico operations. compressed air drilling services segment. our compressed air drilling revenues were 43.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, an increase of 67.7 compared to 25.7 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2005. income from operations increased 92.6 to 10.8 million in 2006 compared to income from operations of 5.6 million in 2005. our compressed air drilling revenues and operating income for the 2006 period increased compared to the 2005 period due in part to the acquisition of the air drilling assets of w. t., our investment in additional equipment and improved pricing in west texas. production services segment. our production services revenues were 19.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2006, compared to 9.8 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2005. income from operations was 2.1 million in 2006 compared to a loss from operations of 99,000 in 2005. the increase in revenue is attributable to the acquisition of petro rentals completed in october 2006, the acquisition of capcoil on may 1, 2005 and improved utilization and pricing for our services. the increase in operating income is primarily related to the operations of petro rentals and the addition of two coil tubing units in the fourth quarter of 2006. comparison of years ended december 31, 2005 and december 31, 2004 our revenue for the year ended december 31, 2005 was 105.3 million, an increase of 120.7 compared to 47.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. the increase in revenues was principally due to acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the second and third quarters of 2005, the addition of operations and sales personnel, the opening of new operations offices, and the purchase of additional equipment. acquisitions completed during this period enabled us to establish our rental tool and production services segments which resulted in an increased offering of products and services and an expansion of our customer base. directional drilling services segment revenues increased in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period due to the addition of operations and sales personnel, the opening of new operations offices and the purchase of additional downhole motors which increased our capacity and market presence. revenues increased at our compressed air drilling segment due to

our compressed air drilling services segment, including revenues resulting from the acquisition of diamond air and the compressed air drilling assets of w.t., increased revenues from mexico, improved market conditions for our domestic casing and tubing segment and the growth of our rental tools segment through the acquisition of delta on april 1, 2005. depreciation expense increased 80.4 to 4.9 million in 2005 compared to 2.7 million in 2004. the increase is due to additional depreciable assets resulting from capital expenditures and acquisitions in 2004 and 2005. our cost of revenues consists principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of our equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. because many of our costs are fixed, our gross profit as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues. general and administrative expense was 15.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2005 compared to 7.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. general and administrative expense increased due to the additional expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in the second half of 2004 and in 2005, and the hiring of additional sales and administrative personnel. general and administrative expense also increased because of increased legal and accounting fees and other expenses related to our financing and acquisition activities, increased consulting fees in connection with our internal controls and corporate governance process, and increased corporate accounting and administrative staff. as a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were 14.8 for 2005 and 15.3 for 2004. amortization expense was 1.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2005 compared to 0.9 million for

compared to 2.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2004. interest expense increased during 2005 due to the increased borrowings associated with the acquisitions completed in the second and third quarters of 2005, equipment purchases and higher average interest rates, offset in part by the prepayment, in december 2004, of our 12 2.4 million subordinated note. additionally, in 2005, we incurred debt retirement expense of 1.1 million related to the refinancing of our debt. this amount includes prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred financing fees from a previous financing. minority interest in income of subsidiaries for the year ended december 31, 2005 was 488,000 compared to 321,000 for the corresponding period in 2004 due to the increase in profitability at aircomp

due to the increase in drilling activity in the texas and gulf coast areas, the establishment of new operations in west texas and oklahoma, the addition of operations and sales personnel, the purchase of additional downhole motors which increased our capacity and market presence and the acquisition of target, a provider of measurement while drilling equipment, effective august 2005. our operating

bridge loan facility that was outstanding at december 31, 2006. b these amounts represent our minimum capital lease payments, net of interest payments totaling 15,000. we have identified capital expenditure projects that will require up to approximately 80.0 million in 2007, exclusive of any acquisitions. we believe that our cash generated from operations, cash on hand and cash available under our credit facilities will provide sufficient funds for our identified projects. we intend to implement a growth strategy of increasing the scope of services through both internal growth and acquisitions. we are regularly involved in discussions with a number of potential acquisition candidates. we expect to make capital expenditures to acquire and to maintain our existing equipment. our performance and cash flow from operations will be determined by the demand for our services which in turn are affected by our customers expenditures for oil and natural gas exploration and development and industry perceptions and expectations of future oil and natural gas prices in the areas where we operate. we will need to refinance our existing debt facilities as they become due and provide funds for capital expenditures and acquisitions. to effect our expansion plans, we will require additional equity or debt financing in excess of our current working capital and amounts available under credit facilities. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the additional debt or equity capital or that we can do so on terms that will be acceptable to us. recent developments in january 2007, we closed on a private offering, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act, of 255.0 million principal amount of our 8.5 senior notes due 2017. the proceeds of the senior notes offering, together with a portion of the proceeds of our concurrent common stock offering, were used to repay the debt outstanding under our 300 million bridge loan facility, which we incurred to finance our acquisition of substantially all the assets of ogr. in january 2007, we closed on a public offering of 6.0 million shares of our common stock at 17.65 per share. the proceeds of the common stock offering, together with the proceeds of our concurrent senior notes offering, were used to repay the debt outstanding under our 300 million bridge loan facility, which we incurred to finance our acquisition of substantially all the assets of ogr and for general corporate purposes. on february 7, 2007, zane tankel was elected as a member of our board of directors. critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations 44 table of contents is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document. our preparation of this report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. allowance for doubtful accounts. the determination of the collectibility of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends, including monitoring our customer payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectibility is reasonably assured, as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our customers operate. those uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our customers ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident that the customers will not be able to make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future. revenue recognition. we provide rental equipment and drilling services to our customers at per day and per job contractual rates and recognize the drilling related revenue as the work progresses and when collectibility is reasonably assured. the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no. 104, revenue recognition in financial statements, provides guidance on the sec staff s views on application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues. our revenue recognition policy is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no. 104. impairment of long lived assets. long lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, comprise a significant amount of our total assets. we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives. additionally, the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable. this requires us to make long term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. these forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. goodwill and other intangibles. as of december 31, 2006, we have recorded approximately 125.8 million of goodwill and 32.8 million of other identifiable intangible assets. we perform purchase price allocations to intangible assets when we make a business combination. business combinations and purchase price allocations have been consummated for acquisitions in all of our reportable segments. the excess of the purchase price after allocation of fair values to tangible assets is allocated to identifiable intangibles and thereafter to goodwill. subsequently, we perform our initial impairment tests and annual impairment tests in accordance with financial accounting standards board no. 141, business combinations, and financial accounting standards board no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets. these initial valuations used two approaches to determine the carrying amount of the individual reporting units. the first approach is the discounted cash flow method, which focuses on our expected cash flow. in applying this approach, the cash flow available for distribution is projected for a finite period of years. cash flow available for distribution is defined as the amount of cash that could be distributed as a dividend without impairing our future profitability or operations. the cash flow available for distribution and the terminal value our value at the end of the estimation period are then discounted to present value to derive an indication of value of the business enterprise. this valuation method is dependent upon the assumptions made regarding future cash flow and cash requirements. the second approach is the guideline company method which focuses on comparing us to selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies. under this method, valuation multiples are i derived from operating data of selected similar companies ii evaluated and adjusted based on our strengths and weaknesses relative to the selected guideline companies and iii applied to our operating data to arrive at an indication of value. this valuation method is dependent upon the assumption that our value can be evaluated by analysis of our earnings and our strengths and weaknesses relative to the selected similar companies. 45 table of contents significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. income taxes. the determination and evaluation of our annual income tax provision involves the interpretation of tax laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of income, deductions and tax credits. changes in tax laws, regulations and our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction may impact our tax liability in any given year. while our annual tax provision is based on the information available to us at the time, a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in certain tax jurisdictions are determined. current income tax expense reflects an estimate of our income tax liability for the current year, withholding taxes, changes in tax rates and changes in prior year tax estimates as returns are filed. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect at year end. a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. it is our intention to permanently reinvest all of the undistributed earnings of our non u.s. subsidiaries in such subsidiaries. accordingly, we have not provided for u.s. deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings of our non u.s. subsidiaries. if a distribution is made to us from the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries, we could be required to record additional taxes. because we cannot predict when, if at all, we will make a distribution of these undistributed earnings, we are unable to make a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability. recently issued accounting standards in february 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 155, accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments. sfas no. 155 provides entities with relief from having to separately determine the fair value of an embedded derivative that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from its host contract in accordance with sfas no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. sfas no. 155 allows an entity to make an irrevocable election to measure such a hybrid financial instrument at fair value in its entirely, with changes in fair value recognized in earning. sfas no. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired , issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september 15, 2006. we believe that the adoption of sfas no. 155 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in march 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 156, accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment to fasb statement no. 140. sfas no. 156 requires entities to recognize a servicing asset or liability each time they undertake an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain situations. this statement also requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value and permits a choice of either the amortization or fair value measurement method for subsequent measurement. the effective date of this statement is for annual periods beginning after september 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year provided the entity has not issued any financial statements for that year. we do not plan to adopt sfas no. 156 early, and we are currently assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements. in july 2006, the fasb issued fasb interpretation, fin, no. 48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109. fin no. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no. 109, accounting for income taxes. it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. this new standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. the provisions of fin no. 48 are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard. only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of fin no. 48. the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin no. 48 should be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of 46 table of contents retaining earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position for that fiscal year. the provisions of fin no. 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2006. we are currently evaluating the impact of applying the provisions of fin no. 48. in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no. 157, fair value measurements. sfas no. 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. sfas no. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. we believe that the adoption of sfas no. 157 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in september 2006, the fasb issued fsp no. aug air 1, accounting for planned major maintenance activities. fsp no. aug air 1 prohibits the
