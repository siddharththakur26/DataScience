14,793 results of operations three months ended march 31, 1999 vs. three months ended march 31, 1998 general. anacomp reported a net loss of 14.9 million for the three months ended march 31, 1999, compared to a net loss of 15.9 million for the three months ended march 31, 1998. earnings from continuing operations before interest, other income, taxes, depreciation and amortization ebitda were 24.7 million, or 22.0 of revenues, for the three months ended march 31, 1999. this compares to ebitda of 16.7 million, or 18.3 of revenues for the three months ended march 31, 1998. revenues. the company's continuing revenues increased 23.2 from 91.3 million for the three months ended march 31, 1998, to 112.5 million for the three months ended march 31, 1999. the company experienced increased revenues of 22.8 million in its outsource services business line primarily resulting from the acquisition of the first image ias business ias business and the inclusion of the ias business operating results for the three months ending march 31, 1999. digital service revenues, which are included in outsource services, also increased significantly with quarterly revenues of 5.9 million. the company experienced increases in revenues of 3.2 million, or 33.0 , in output systems for the three month period ended march 31, 1999 compared to the comparable period ended march 31, 1998. of this increase, 1.3 million represented sales of com systems and 1.9 million represented sales of digital solutions. offsetting this increase was a 4.4 million decline, or 15.3 , in micrographics supplies revenues. the decrease in micrographics supplies revenues was the result of the company's discontinuance of the sale of duplicate microfilm to the reseller market, as well as declining sales of original com microfilm and duplicate microfilm, which is consistent with long term trends. gross margins. the company's gross margins increased 22.9 from 35.3 million 38.6 of revenues for the three months ended march 31, 1998, to 43.4 million 38.5 of revenues for the three months ended march 31, 1999. total gross margins, as a percentage of revenue, remained level with the prior year. outsource service margins, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 4.8 percentage points from 1998 to 1999 principally because of decreases in average selling prices for outsource service business and because of costs incurred for the consolidation of ias business data centers. this decrease was offset by increased gross margin percentages for com systems, digital solutions and micrographics supplies. included in the cost of sales and services are engineering costs of 2.2 million and 2.5 million for the three month periods ended march 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. of those amounts, 1.7 million and 0.9 million for those periods, respectively, represent research and development activities predominantly related to digital products. the remaining portion of the engineering costs represents support costs for the company's current product offerings. selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative sg a expenses increased 1.9 from 22.9 million 25.1 of revenues for the three months ended march 31, 1998 to 23.4 million 20.8 of revenues for the three months ended march 31, 1999. this increase is primarily the result of operating costs of the ias business and of costs related to new strategic marketing initiatives. sg a costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 4.3 percentage points primarily because of the added ias business sales volume. amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets increased 141.6 from 2.1 million 2.3 of revenues for the three months ended march 31, 1998, to 5.1 million 4.5 of revenues for the three months ended march 31, 1999. this increase is principally the result of the amortization of goodwill associated with the ias business acquisition in fiscal year 1998 and the eight acquisitions completed in fiscal year 1999. interest expense. interest expense increased 29.7 from 8.0 million for the three months ended march 31, 1998 to 10.3 million for the three months ended march 31, 1999. this increase was the result of additional borrowings used to finance the ias business acquisition. provision for income taxes. the company's effective tax rate remained at 42 of taxable income for both periods presented. see note 7 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. six months ended march 31, 1999 vs. six months ended march 31, 1998 general. anacomp reported a net loss of 29.4 million for the six months ended march 31, 1999, compared to a net loss of 31.2 million for the six months ended march 31, 1998. ebitda was 49.2 million, or 21.7 of revenues, for the six months ended march 31, 1999. this compares to ebitda of 33.9 million, or 18.4 of revenues for the six months ended march 31, 1998. revenues. the company's continuing revenues increased 23.5 from 183.8 million for the six months ended march 31, 1998, to 226.9 million for the six months ended march 31, 1999. the company experienced increased revenues of 49.8 million in its outsource services business line while experiencing decreased revenues of 8.1 million in its micrographic supplies product line. the increase in outsource service revenues resulted primarily from the june 1, 1998 acquisition of ias business and the inclusion of its operating results for the six months ending march 31, 1999. digital service revenues, which are included in outsource services, also increased significantly with six month revenues of 13.2 million. the decrease in micrographics supplies revenues was the result of the company's discontinuance of the sale of duplicate microfilm to the reseller market, as well as declining sales of original com microfilm and duplicate microfilm, which is consistent with long term trends. gross margins. the company's gross margins increased 24.2 from 70.1 million 38.2 of revenues for the six months ended march 31, 1998, to 87.1 million 38.4 of revenues for the six months ended march 31, 1999. outsource service margins, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 3.8 percentage points from 1998 to 1999 principally because of decreases in average selling prices for outsource service business and because of costs incurred for the consolidation of ias business data centers. this decrease was offset by increased gross margin percentages for com systems and micrographics supplies. included in the cost of sales and services are engineering costs of 4.4 million and 5.0 million for the six month periods ended march 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. of those amounts, 3.0 million and 1.9 million for those periods represent research and development activities predominantly related to digital products. the remaining portion of the engineering costs represents support costs for the company's current product offerings. the company's digital research and development activities have increased to an annual spending rate of 6.5 million in fiscal 1999 compared to 2.5 million in the prior year. selling, general and administrative expenses. sg a expenses increased 7.3 from 44.6 million 24.2 of revenues for the six months ended march 31, 1998 to 47.8 million 21.1 of revenues for the six months ended march 31, 1999. this increase resulted primarily from operating costs of the ias business. sg a costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 3.1 percentage points primarily because of the added ias business sales volume. amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets increased 105.9 from 4.7 million 2.6 of revenues for the six months ended march 31, 1998, to 9.6 million 4.2 of revenues for the six months ended march 31, 1999. this increase is primarily related to the amortization of goodwill associated with the ias business acquisition in fiscal year 1998 and the eight acquisitions completed in fiscal year 1999. interest expense. interest expense increased 27.7 from 15.9 million for the six months ended march 31, 1998 to 20.3 million for the six months ended march 31, 1999. this increase was the result of additional borrowings used to finance the acquisition of ias business. provision for income taxes. the company's effective tax rate remained at 42 of taxable income for both periods presented. see note 7 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. liquidity and capital resources anacomp's working capital at march 31, 1999 was 28.5 million, compared to 27.2 million at september 30, 1998. net cash provided by operating activities was 19.1 million for the six months ended march 31, 1999, compared to a use of 4.1 million in the comparable prior period. the current period benefited from an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately 7.7 million, which was primarily the result of increased goodwill and depreciable assets from the ias business acquisition. the remainder of the improvement resulted primarily from a 13.3 million improvement in the use of working capital from the prior year, specifically with respect to accounts receivable and current liabilities. net cash used in investing activities was 21.4 million in the current period, compared to 21.0 million in the comparable prior period. the decrease in capital used to acquire companies and customer rights, along with the proceeds from the sale of businesses, was offset by an increase in capital expenditures that were primarily used to integrate the ias business. net cash used in financing activities decreased approximately 330,000 during the six months ended march 31, 1999 with respect to the same period in the prior year. during the current period the issuance of common stock decreased by 843,000 and the company repurchased 2.2 million of common stock. in addition, principal payments on long term debt decreased by 3.4 million. the company's cash balance including restricted cash as of march 31, 1999 was 14.5 million compared to 22.0 million at september 30, 1998. the company also has available an 80 million revolving credit facility. there were no amounts outstanding under revolving credit facility as of march 31, 1999. the company borrowed 12.0 million on april 1, 1999 to fund the 18.2 million semi annual interest payment on its 10 7 8 senior subordinated notes. the company has significant debt service obligations. as of march 31, 1999, the company had 335 million of 10 7 8 senior subordinated notes outstanding. the notes are due in april 2004. the ability of the company to meet its debt service and other obligations will depend upon its future performance and is subject to financial, economic and other factors, some of which are beyond its control. however, the company believes that cash generated from operations, cash on hand, cash to be received from the sale of the magnetics division, and cash available under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund its debt service requirements, acquisition strategies, and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future. year 2000 anacomp has undertaken a comprehensive year 2000 program for the products that it sells or distributes in the marketplace. under this program, the company has assessed all of its critical software and hardware products to determine what remediation, if any, is necessary for the proper functioning of these systems in the year 2000 and beyond. the company has worked with its outside suppliers to ensure that they will continue to support the products that they supply to anacomp for resale, including the performance by the suppliers of any required year 2000 remediation. anacomp has also analyzed and updated for year 2000 purposes certain software and hardware systems that it uses internally. the company continues to consider year 2000 issues for all new products and services as well as those in development or included in business acquisitions. state of readiness. anacomp's overall state of readiness can be assessed by describing its specific readiness in four key areas, namely its products and services, its suppliers' products and services, its internal systems, and its products in development. anacomp has completed the assessment, remediation and year 2000 testing phases of nearly all supported products and services, including those responsible for generating the material portion of its revenues. anacomp summarizes the status of each completed product or service in a written report to the company's year 2000 steering committee for archiving in the company's year 2000 database. these processes have been reviewed and approved by a third party consultant retained for this purpose. the implementation phase of the company's year 2000 project depends upon the response of the company's customers who may require upgrades or migration paths. anacomp is in the process of communicating with identified customers and has no reason to believe that all customers who require upgrades or migration will not receive them. to this end, anacomp has offered and continues to offer financial incentives to encourage early responses and to avoid peak demand loads, although no assurance can be made that the demand will be spread sufficiently to eliminate delays in implementation. anacomp has also launched its analog as a fail safe campaign to educate customers about the value of microfilm as a way to minimize the risk of the year 2000. although customers may divert expenditures away from these microfilm products and services in order to fund other year 2000 remediation, anacomp encourages customers to consider these products and services as a cost effective backup to digital storage because the retrieval of data stored on microfilm does not require digital technology. anacomp has categorized approximately 850 of its suppliers into one of four categories depending upon the criticality of the product or service and the amount of time necessary to implement the contingency plans that anacomp has identified. if a supplier does not declare its readiness to anacomp in enough time to permit implementation of its contingency plans before december 31, 1999, anacomp may replace the supplier, have the supplier hold additional inventory of the supplier's products, or implement alternative contingency plans depending upon the product or service provided. as of april 30, 1999, anacomp had received written responses to anacomp's year 2000 readiness questionnaire from approximately 90 of the 165 suppliers that anacomp deems critical to its operations. anacomp has either received declarations of readiness from, or established contingency plans for, all critical suppliers. for example, anacomp is currently interviewing alternative sources of key products as part of its contingency planning but has no reason to believe that any of its critical suppliers will not be ready in time. for those anacomp products that incorporate the products of a third party supplier, anacomp continues to request that its suppliers disclose test procedures and results. anacomp has also requested that its vendors in the human resources area, such as its retirement, health and insurance providers, respond in writing as to their readiness, but there can be no assurance that such vendors will either respond or achieve readiness in a timely fashion. anacomp has identified all internal software and hardware products used in its corporate headquarters in poway, california, including those used to assimilate and report financial information and to handle billing, collections and electronic commerce. in those instances where remediation or renovation was required, anacomp has either completed or has nearly completed such remediation or renovation. anacomp is in the process of completing the documentation of such efforts for its year 2000 archives. the company continues to develop new products and services and to acquire new businesses. anacomp develops and tests each new product, sometimes with the assistance of an outside consultant, for year 2000 readiness. businesses that anacomp acquires, such as first image, are subject to the same assessment, remediation, testing and implementation phases as those described above. costs. total expenditures on its year 2000 project, including costs of outside parties such as consultants and attorneys, costs of hardware and software remediation, and internal labor, travel and out of pocket expenses, were approximately 0.3 million and 2.3 million for fiscal year 1997 and 1998, respectively, and is estimated to be 1.2 million in fiscal year 1999. these figures include estimates from the engineering, manufacturing, legal and information technology departments of the company. risks. there can be no assurance that the company and its vendors and suppliers will be able to identify all year 2000 issues before problems manifest themselves or to complete all remediation in the required time frame. further, it is possible that the future level of expenses in the company's remediation efforts could rise significantly. the company relies upon the continuous provision of services from third parties such as electrical and telecommunication utilities around the world, and the company plans to enhance its electronic data transmission capabilities. any sustained disruption of service or capability could adversely impact the company's ability to operate its business. finally, there can be no assurance that, if left unremedied, the products or services that the company sells or distributes would remain competitive in the marketplace or the products that the company uses internally would not have a material effect upon the ability of the company to report its financial results. contingency plans. in those instances where the company determines that year 2000 problems with its operational facilities may not be identified or remediated in time, the company believes that its business will still be able to function without substantial interruption. for example, com services provided in a data center that experiences a loss of power due to a third party utility's failure to identify or remediate an isolated year 2000 problem could be shifted to another data center without substantial interruption. in addition, electronic transmission of data could be replaced with manual delivery of data upon completion of certain modifications. in those instances where an installed com customer experiences a year 2000 problem while operating its own com equipment, anacomp could offer its com services to the customer at one of its data centers upon completion of certain modifications. this seamless nature of many of anacomp's products and services forms the basis of anacomp's ongoing contingency planning.
