item 1a risk factors for a discussion of the risks related to competition for partner relationships. while our business is diversified by product and geography, including the corporate card business, a large international business and gns partners around the world, the global economic environment remains challenging. in addition, our results could be adversely affected by u.s. income tax law changes, volatility in foreign exchange rates or changes in interest rates. 36 table of contents american express company consolidated results of operations refer to the glossary of selected

30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. the increases were driven by growth in billed business, partially offset by a decrease in the average discount rate and higher cash rebate rewards. billed business was 9 percent and 7 percent for the three and six month periods, respectively, in both the u.s. and outside the u.s. foreign exchange rates had a minimal impact on billed business outside the u.s. as compared to reported results for both the three and six month periods. see tables 5, 6 and 7 for more detail on billed business performance. the average discount rate was 2.48 and 2.52 percent for the three months ended june 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the average discount rate was 2.50 and 2.52 percent for the six months ended june 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. see current business environment outlook for information on the changes in the average discount rate. 37 table of contents net card fees increased 40 million or 6 percent and 61 million or 5 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting growth in total cards in force and a higher average fee per card within uscs and ics. travel commissions and fees increased 5 million or 1 percent and decreased 9 million or 1 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. other commissions and fees increased 19 million or 3 percent and 64 million or 5 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. the increases were primarily driven by higher revenue from our loyalty partner business, as well as higher delinquency fees for the six month period. other revenue increased 18 million or 3 percent and decreased 18 million or 2 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. the increase for the three month period reflected lower card member reimbursements and a larger gain on the sale of investment securities, partially offset by the loss of revenue from the divested publishing business. the decrease for the six month period reflected the loss of revenue from the divested publishing business, partially offset by lower card member reimbursements and a larger gain on the sale of investment securities. interest income increased 65 million or 4 percent and 79 million or 2 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. the increases reflected higher interest on loans, driven by growth in average card member loans, partially offset by decreases in interest and dividends on investment securities, driven by lower average investment securities. the three month period also reflected lower card member reimbursements. interest expense decreased 49 million or 10 percent and 129 million or 13 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. the decreases were primarily driven by lower interest on deposits, as a result of lower funding costs, partially offset by higher average customer deposits. the decreases also reflected lower funding costs on long term debt. table 3 provisions for losses summary three

provision for losses decreased 52 million or 16 percent and 45 million or 8 percent for the three and six month periods ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior

increased 199 million or 25 percent and 191 million or 14 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, driven by the reinvestment of a significant portion of the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction in growth initiatives across all segments. card member rewards expense increased 172 million or 11 percent for the three months ended june 30, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year. the increase reflected higher co brand rewards expense of 74 million, primarily related to higher spending volumes, and an increase in membership rewards expense of 98 million. the current period increase in membership rewards expense was primarily due to an 87 million increase related to higher new points earned, in line with higher spending volume, in addition to an 11 million increase related to membership rewards points previously earned but not yet redeemed. the latter increase was driven by enhancements in the ultimate redemption rate urr estimation process in certain international countries, partially offset by slower average growth in the urr and favorable changes in the weighted average cost per point wac assumptions as compared to the same period in the prior year. card member rewards expense increased 234 million or 7 percent for the six months ended june 30, 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year. the increase reflected higher co brand rewards expense of 103 million and membership rewards expense of 131 million, primarily driven by higher spending volumes. the membership rewards urr for current program participants was 95 percent rounded up at june 30, 2014, an increase from 94 percent rounded down at june 30, 2013. the increase in the urr reflected greater engagement in our membership rewards program. card member services and other expense decreased 1 million or 1 percent and increased 32 million or 8 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. the increase in the six month period was primarily driven by increased engagement levels and usage of certain card member benefits. salaries and employee benefits expense increased 115 million or 7 percent and 40 million or 1 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. the increases reflect a second quarter restructuring charge, partially offset by lower payroll expense in the six month period. other expense decreased 361 million or 22 percent and 423 million or 13 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by the net gain recognized as a result of the business travel joint venture transaction. this gain was partially offset by a charitable contribution to the american express foundation and a change in the estimated value of certain investments in our community reinvestment act portfolio in the current period and a canadian value added tax benefit in the prior year. 39 table of contents income taxes the effective tax rate was 33.9 percent and 29.6 percent for the three months ended june 30, 2014, and 2013, respectively. the effective tax rate was 34.5 percent and 31.2 percent for the six months ended june 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the tax rates in all periods primarily reflected the level of pretax income in relation to recurring permanent tax benefits and the geographic mix of business. additionally, the effective tax rate in the three and six month periods ended june 30, 2013 reflected the resolution of certain prior years tax items. table 5 selected statistical information three

spending and average fee per card are computed from proprietary card activities only. average fee per card is computed based on net card fees, including the amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs divided by average worldwide proprietary cards in force. the adjusted average fee per card, which is a non gaap measure, is computed in the same manner, but excludes amortization of deferred direct acquisition costs. the amount of amortization excluded was 77 million and 66 million for the three months ended june 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and 150 million and 131 million for the six months ended june 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we present adjusted average fee per card because we believe this metric presents a useful indicator of card fee pricing across a range of our proprietary card products. 40 table of contents the table below summarizes selected statistics for billed business and average spend during the three months ended june 30, 2014, compared to the same

months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. the increases were primarily driven by higher discount revenue, resulting from billed business growth, lower card member reimbursements and higher net card fees. billed business increased 9 percent and 8 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily reflecting 5 percent and 4 percent increases in average spending per proprietary basic card for the three and six month periods, respectively, and 4 percent higher cards in force. interest income increased 54 million or 4 percent and 91 million or 3 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily driven by higher average card member loans, partially offset by higher card member reimbursements in the six month period. interest expense decreased 25 million or 14 percent and 57 million or 16 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to lower funding costs. 45 table of contents provisions for losses decreased 17 million or 5 percent and increased 35 million or 5 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. the decrease for the three month period was primarily driven by the benefit of lower net write offs for card member loans, partially offset by a lower charge card reserve release compared to the prior year. the increase for the six month period was primarily driven by a lower charge card reserve release compared to the prior year, partially offset by the benefit of lower net write offs for card member loans. refer to table 11 for the lending and charge card write off rates for 2014 and 2013. marketing, promotion, rewards, card member services and other expenses increased 130 million or 7 percent and 167 million or 5 percent for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher card member rewards and marketing and promotion. the increases in marketing and promotion were driven by the reinvestment of a significant portion of the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction in growth initiatives. card member rewards expense increased 97 million and 135 million for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. the increases reflected higher co brand expense, which increased approximately 58 million and 88 million for the three and six month periods, respectively, primarily reflecting higher spending volumes,

consolidated capital resources and liquidity our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain a solid and flexible equity capital profile a broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements and liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12 month period, even in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. capital strategy our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through earnings and other sources to maintain a solid equity capital base and to provide flexibility to support future business growth. we believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. the level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process, which reflects our business activities, as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies, regulators and shareholders, among others. our consolidated capital position is also influenced by subsidiary capital requirements. as a bank holding company, we are also subject to regulatory requirements administered by the u.s. federal banking agencies. the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items. beginning in 2014, as a basel iii advanced approaches institution, we report our capital ratios using basel iii capital definitions, inclusive of transition provisions, and basel i risk weighted assets. beginning in 2015, we will report our capital ratios using the basel iii capital definitions, inclusive of transition provisions, and the basel iii standardized approach for calculating risk weighted assets. the basel iii standards will be fully phased in by january 1, 2019. we have also adopted basel iii in certain non u.s. jurisdictions. during 2014, we began reporting capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to regulators under basel requirements for a basel iii advanced approaches institution. the parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting and subsequently begin publicly reporting our capital ratios using both basel iii standardized and advanced approaches. 55 table of contents the following table presents our regulatory risk based capital ratios and leverage ratios and those of our significant bank subsidiaries, as well as additional ratios widely utilized in the marketplace, as of june 30, 2014. table 18 regulatory risk based capital and leverage ratios basel iiistandards2014 a ratios as of june 30, 2014 risk based capital common equity tier 1 4.0 american

iii minimum and conservation buffer as defined by the federal reserve for calendar year 2014 for advanced approaches institutions. b refer to page 57 for discussion on tangible common equity, a non gaap measure. the transition provisions for 2014 under basel iii cause our reported capital ratios to be higher than they would have been under the prior regulatory standards, known as basel i. specifically, the common equity tier 1 risk based capital and tier 1 risk based capital ratios would have been approximately 40 basis points lower under basel i. the largest contributor to the difference is the way intangible assets are being treated and ultimately transitioned in over a 5 year period under basel iii. the following provides definitions for our regulatory risk based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance, if applicable risk weighted assets assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the federal reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. on and off balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk adjusted weight. the off balance sheet items comprise a minimal part of the overall calculation. risk weighted assets under basel i as of june 30, 2014 were 130.7 billion. common equity tier 1 risk based capital ratio the common equity tier 1 risk based capital ratio is calculated as common equity tier 1 capital, divided by risk weighted assets. common equity tier 1 is the sum of common shareholders equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows net unrealized gains losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other postretirement benefit losses, all net of tax. common equity tier 1 capital as of june 30, 2014 was 17.5 billion. 56 table of contents tier 1 risk based capital ratio the tier 1 capital ratio is calculated as tier 1 capital divided by risk weighted assets. tier 1 capital is the sum of common equity tier 1 capital, certain perpetual preferred stock not applicable to us , and third party non controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries. tier 1 capital as of june 30, 2014 was 17.5 billion. total risk based capital ratio the total risk based capital ratio is calculated as the sum of tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital, divided by risk weighted assets. tier 2 capital is the sum of the allowance for receivable and loan losses limited to 1.25 percent of risk weighted assets and a portion of the unrealized gains on equity securities, plus a 750 million subordinated hybrid security, for which we received approval from the federal reserve for treatment as tier 2 capital. tier 2 capital as of june 30, 2014 was 2.0 billion. the 750 million subordinated hybrid security does not meet the requirements of tier 2 capital under basel iii, and is being transitioned out of capital beginning in 2014. as a result, starting in the first quarter of 2014, the amount included in tier 2 capital is 375 million. see fully phased in basel iii section. tier 1 leverage ratio the tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. average total consolidated assets as of june 30, 2014 were 149.3 billion. the following provides a definition for tangible common equity to risk weighted assets ratio, which is widely used in the marketplace, although it may be calculated differently by different companies common equity and tangible common equity to risk weighted assets ratios common equity equals our shareholders equity of 20.2 billion as of june 30, 2014, and tangible common equity, a non gaap measure, equals common equity less goodwill and other intangibles of 3.8 billion as of june 30, 2014. we believe presenting the ratio of tangible common equity to risk weighted assets is a useful measure of evaluating the strength of our capital position. we seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and finance such capital in a cost efficient manner failure to maintain minimum capital levels could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the respective regulatory agencies to take actions that could limit our business operations. our primary source of equity capital has been the generation of net income. historically, capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, has exceeded the annual growth in our capital requirements. to the extent capital has exceeded business, regulatory and rating agency requirements, we have historically returned excess capital to shareholders through our regular common share dividend and share repurchase program. we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. for example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. these infused amounts can affect the capital profile and liquidity levels at the american express parent company level. we do not currently intend or foresee a need to shift capital from non u.s. subsidiaries with permanently reinvested earnings to a u.s. parent company. 57 table of contents fully phased in basel iii basel iii, when fully phased in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain more capital than prior requirements, with a greater emphasis on common equity. we estimate that had basel iii been fully phased in during the six months ended june 30, 2014, our reported common equity tier 1 risk based capital and tier 1 risk based capital ratios would have been 12.6 percent and our reported tier 1 leverage ratio would have been 11.2 percent. as of june 30, 2014, had the basel iii rules been fully phased in, our supplementary leverage ratio would be 9.4 percent.6 these ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk weighted assets. as noted previously, we are currently taking steps toward basel iii advanced approaches implementation in the u.s. our 750 million subordinated hybrid security, which was previously fully included in tier 2 capital but not in tier 1 capital , does not meet the requirements of tier 2 capital under basel iii. the phase out of this subordinated hybrid security from tier 2 capital began in the first quarter of 2014, which affects our total risk based capital ratio. however, this ratio is expected to remain well in excess of the required minimum. the following provides definitions for fully phased in basel iii capital ratios as defined by the basel iii rules using the standardized approach. all calculations are non gaap measures. fully phased in basel iii common equity tier 1 risk based capital ratio the fully phased in basel iii common equity tier 1 risk based capital ratio is calculated as common equity tier 1 under fully phased in basel iii rules divided by risk weighted assets under fully phased in basel iii rules. fully phased in basel iii tier 1 risk based capital ratio the fully phased in basel iii tier 1 risk based capital ratio is calculated as tier 1 capital under fully phased in basel iii rules divided by risk weighted assets under fully phased in basel iii rules. the following table presents a comparison of our common equity tier 1 and tier 1 risk based capital under transitional basel iii rules to our estimated common equity tier 1 and tier 1 risk based capital under fully phased in basel iii rules. table 19 transitional basel iii versus fully phased in basel iii billions june 30, 2014 risk based capital under transitional basel iii 17.5 adjustments related to aoci 0.2

basel iii risk weighted assets the fully phased in basel iii risk weighted assets reflect our basel i risk weighted assets, adjusted under fully phased in basel iii rules. this includes incremental risk weighting applied to deferred tax assets and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as exposures to past due accounts, equities and sovereigns. the fully phased in basel iii risk weighted assets as of june 30, 2014 were estimated to be 131.9 billion. 6 the fully phased in basel iii capital ratios are non gaap measures. we believe the presentation of the capital ratios is helpful to investors by showing the impact of future regulatory capital standards on our capital ratios. 58 table of contents fully phased in basel iii tier 1 leverage ratio the fully phased in basel iii tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing fully phased in basel iii tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets. basel iii supplementary leverage ratio the supplementary leverage ratio under fully phased in basel iii rules is calculated by dividing fully phased in basel iii tier 1 capital by our total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes under basel iii. total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes reflect total consolidated assets with adjustments for tier 1 capital deductions, off balance sheet derivatives, undrawn unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off balance sheet liabilities. total assets for supplementary leverage capital purposes as of june 30, 2014 were estimated to be 177.2 billion. share repurchases and dividends we have a share repurchase program to return excess capital to shareholders. the share repurchases reduce shares outstanding and offset, in whole or part, the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. during the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, the company returned 1.4 billion and 2.6 billion, respectively, to its shareholders in the form of dividends 0.3 billion and 0.5 billion, respectively and share repurchases 1.1 billion and 2.1 billion, respectively . we repurchased 12.7 million common shares at an average price of 90.30 in the second quarter of 2014. these dividend and share repurchase amounts represent approximately 87 percent and 80 percent of total capital generated during the three and six month periods, respectively. these percentages for 2014 are significantly greater than the on average and over time target to distribute approximately 50 percent of the capital to shareholders as dividends or through the repurchases of common stock. these distribution percentages result from the strength of our capital ratios and the amount of capital we generate from net income and through employee stock plans in relation to the amount of capital required to support our organic business growth and through acquisitions. the company is expecting to execute its share repurchase program, subject to market conditions and pursuant to its capital plan, which includes up to 2.3 billion in share repurchases for the remainder of 2014. funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well diversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations, cost effectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. the diversity of funding sources by type of debt instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of debt, maturity or investor. the mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives. our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset liability management activities. we have in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of our subsidiaries. our proprietary card businesses are the primary asset generating businesses, with significant assets in both domestic and international card member receivable and lending activities. our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card issuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to support all of our business activities, such as merchant payments. we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by card members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period card member loans and receivables are outstanding. we also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes, including acquisition activities. we seek to raise funds to meet all of our financing needs, including seasonal and other working capital needs, while also seeking to maintain sufficient highly liquid assets to meet our net cash flow needs under stressed environments, which include the scheduled maturities of funding obligations. we currently expect to satisfy basel iii s liquidity coverage ratio standard, based upon our current understanding of the requirements, through our current funding programs and liquidity strategies. 59 table of contents during the second quarter of 2014, we issued i 1.3 billion of asset backed securities from american express credit account master trust the lending trust with a maturity of five years, which included 1.25 billion of class a certificates at 1 month libor plus 37 basis points and 67.0 million of class b certificates at 1 month libor plus 50 basis points and ii 2.4 billion of dual tranche senior unsecured notes from american express credit corporation with a maturity of three years consisting of 1.65 billion of fixed rate senior notes with a coupon of 1.125 percent and 0.75 billion of floating rate senior notes at a rate of 3 month libor plus 27 basis points. subsequent to june 30, 2014, the company issued 1.0 billion of class a asset backed securities from the lending trust with a maturity of three years with a coupon of 1.26 percent. our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies moody s investor services moody s , standard poor s s p , fitch ratings fitch and dominion bond rating services dbrs . such ratings help support our access to cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. our asset backed securitization abs activities are rated separately. table 20

securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit. declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. we believe our funding mix, including the proportion of u.s. retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic , should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. deposit programs we offer deposits within our american express centurion bank centurion bank and american express bank, fsb fsb subsidiaries together, the banks . these funds are currently insured up to 250,000 per account holder through the fdic. our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on the banks capital levels. we, through the fsb, have a direct retail deposit program, personal savings from american express, to supplement our distribution of deposit products sourced through third party distribution channels. the direct retail program makes fdic insured certificates of deposit cds and high yield savings account products available directly to consumers. 60 table of contents we held the following deposits as of june 30 table 21 customer deposits billions june 30,2014 december 31, 2013 u.s. retail deposits savings accounts direct

issued through direct and third party programs, were 23.7 months and 48.6 percent, respectively, as of june 30, 2014. asset securitization programs we periodically securitize card member receivables and loans arising from our card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost effective funding. securitization of card member receivables and loans is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third party investors. the proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. the receivables and loans being securitized are reported as assets on our consolidated balance sheets and the related securities issued to third party investors are reported as long term debt. under the respective terms of the securitization trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or in a worst case scenario, early amortization of investor securities. during the six months ended june 30, 2014, no such triggering events occurred. liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off balance sheet liquidity sources. we maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet business requirements and expected future financial obligations for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. we have in place a liquidity risk policy that sets out our approach to managing liquidity risk on an enterprise wide basis. we incur and accept liquidity risk arising in the normal course of offering our products and services. the liquidity risks that we are exposed to can arise from a variety of sources, and thus our liquidity management strategy includes a variety of parameters, assessments and guidelines, including, but not limited to maintaining a diversified set of funding sources refer to funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off balance sheet liquidity sources available to meet obligations projecting cash inflows and outflows from a variety of sources and under a variety of scenarios, including contingent liquidity exposures such as collateral requirements for derivative transactions and trade offs between the risk of insufficient liquidity and our profitability are incorporated into the internal capital adequacy assessment process. 61 table of contents we maintain liquidity resources sufficient to meet our projected net cash flow needs during stressed environments over various time horizons, including 30 day and 12 month periods. our liquidity resources include highly liquid assets, as well as a variety of other contingent liquidity resources, such as access to undrawn amounts under our secured borrowing facilities and committed bank credit facilities. in addition, the company has access to secured borrowing at the federal reserve discount window. as of june 30, 2014, we had 12.1 billion in excess cash available to fund long term maturities, which includes 18.4 billion classified as cash and cash equivalents and 0.02 billion restricted cash to fund asset backed securitization maturities, less 6.3 billion of cash available to fund day to day operations. the 12.1 billion represents cash residing in the u.s. the upcoming approximate maturities of our long term unsecured debt issued in connection with asset backed securitizations and long term certificates of deposit are as follows

includes capitalized leases of 0.1 billion and certain adjustments which are not included in these balances. our financing needs for the next 12 months are expected to arise from these debt and deposit maturities as well as changes in business needs, including changes in outstanding card member loans and receivables and acquisition activities. we consider various factors in determining the amount of liquidity we maintain, such as economic and financial market conditions, seasonality in business operations, growth in our businesses, potential acquisitions or dispositions, the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources, and regulatory and credit rating agency considerations. the yield we receive on our cash and readily marketable securities is, generally, less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances. thus, we incur substantial net interest costs on these amounts. the level of net interest costs will be dependent on the size of our cash and readily marketable securities holdings, as well as the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields. securitized borrowing capacity as of june 30, 2014, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of july 15, 2016, that gives us the right to sell up to 3.0 billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust . we also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of september 15, 2015, that gives us the right to sell up to 2.0 billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the american express credit account master trust the lending trust . on july 30, 2014, we extended the lending trust s 2.0 billion facility by two years to mature on september 15, 2017. both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund seasonal working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. as of june 30, 2014, no amounts were drawn on the charge trust facility or the lending trust facility. 62 table of contents federal reserve discount window as insured depository institutions, the banks may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that they may pledge. the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral, remain at the discretion of the federal reserve. we had approximately 50.1 billion as of june 30, 2014 in u.s. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our existing securitization trusts, or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. committed bank credit facilities in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described earlier in this section, we maintained committed syndicated bank credit facilities as of june 30, 2014 of 7.2 billion through facilities in the u.s. and australia. on july 29, 2014, we extended our australian dollar credit facility scheduled to mature on august 3, 2015 by two years to mature on august 3, 2017. giving effect to this extension, our total committed bank credit facilities expire as follows table 23 expiration of committed syndicated bank credit facilities billions 2016 2.3 2017 4.9 total 7.2 cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash

primarily include net income adjusted for i non cash items included in net income and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of various payments. 63 table of contents for the six months ended june 30, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was 4.9 billion as a result of net income of 3.0 billion adjusted by non cash items such as certain changes in accounts payable, provisions for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and stock based compensation. in addition, the pretax gain of 626 million related to the business travel joint venture transaction has been deducted from net income. for the six months ended june 30, 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was 10.2 billion as a result of net income of 3.0 billion adjusted by non cash items such as provision for losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and stock based compensation. additionally, the timing of the quarter end cutoff and higher discount business volumes, created an increase in accounts payable and corresponding inflow of cash. cash flows from investing activities our investing activities primarily include funding card member loans and receivables and our available for sale investment portfolio. for the six months ended june 30, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was 1.6 billion consisting of an increase in card member loans and receivables primarily driven by increases in card member spend, as well as purchases of premises and equipment, net of sales. for the six months ended june 30, 2013, net cash used in investing activities was 1.9 billion consisting of an increase in card member receivables driven by higher card member spend partially offset by a decrease in card member loans resulting from higher pay downs, as well as lower purchases of premises and equipment, net of sales. cash flows from financing activities our financing activities primarily include issuing and repaying debt, taking customer deposits, issuing and repurchasing our common shares, and paying dividends. for the six months ended june 30, 2014, net cash used in financing activities was 4.4 billion driven by a 2.4 billion reduction in total short and long term debt as well as 2.1 billion in repurchases of american express common shares. for the six months ended june 30, 2013, net cash used in financing activities was 7.3 billion driven by a 5.5 billion reduction in total short and long term debt as well as 2.1 billion in repurchases of american express common shares. certain other off balance sheet arrangements as of june 30, 2014, we had approximately 275 billion of unused credit available to card members as part of established lending product agreements. total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. our charge card products generally have no pre set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members. 64 table of contents other reporting matters certain legislative, regulatory and other developments as a participant in the financial services industry, and as a bank holding company, we are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the federal reserve and to a range of laws and regulations that impact our business and operations. in light of legislative initiatives over the last several years and continuing regulatory reform implementation, compliance requirements and expenditures have risen for financial services firms, including us, and we expect compliance requirements and expenditures will continue to rise in the future. dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank contains a wide array of provisions intended to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. among other matters, the law created an independent consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb , which has broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws. moreover, the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority with respect to certain federal consumer financial laws for providers of consumer financial products and services, including american express company and certain of our subsidiaries. the cfpb is directed to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. the review of products and practices to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the cfpb and banking regulators more broadly, as well as our own internal reviews. internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our practices, products and procedures. such reviews are also likely to continue to result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, and additional restitution to our card members and may result in additional regulatory actions, including civil money penalties. in december 2013, we announced that certain of our subsidiaries reached settlements with several banking regulators, including the cfpb, to resolve regulatory reviews of marketing and billing practices related to several credit card add on products. for a description of these settlements, see legal proceedings in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2013. in october 2012, we announced that american express company and certain of our subsidiaries reached settlements with several bank regulators, including the cfpb, relating to certain aspects of our u.s. consumer card practices, which requires us to undertake certain actions that have continued in 2014. for a description of these settlements, see legal proceedings in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2012. dodd frank prohibits payment card networks from restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to customers to pay with particular forms of payment, such as cash, check, credit or debit card, or restricting merchants from setting certain minimum, and for certain merchants maximum, transaction amounts for credit cards, as long as any such discounts or incentives or any minimum or maximum transaction amounts do not discriminate on the basis of the issuer or network and comply with applicable federal or state disclosure requirements. 65 table of contents under dodd frank, the federal reserve is also authorized to regulate interchange fees paid to financial institutions on debit card and certain general use prepaid card transactions to ensure that they are reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing individual transactions, and to prohibit payment card networks and issuers from requiring transactions to be processed on a single payment network or fewer than two unaffiliated networks. the federal reserve s rule provides that the regulations on interchange and routing do not apply to a three party network like american express when it acts as both the issuer and the network for prepaid cards, and we are therefore not a payment card network as that term is defined and used for the specific purposes of the rule. dodd frank also authorizes the federal reserve to establish enhanced prudential regulatory requirements, including capital, leverage and liquidity standards, risk management requirements, concentration limits on credit exposures, mandatory resolution plans so called living wills and stress tests for, among others, large bank holding companies, such as american express company, that have greater than 50 billion in assets. we are also required to develop and maintain a capital plan, and to submit the capital plan to the federal reserve for our quantitative and qualitative review under the federal reserve s ccar process. in addition, certain derivative transactions are now required to be centrally cleared, which have increased our collateral posting requirements. many provisions of dodd frank require the adoption of additional rules or regulatory guidance for complete implementation. in addition, dodd frank mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. accordingly, the ultimate consequences of dodd frank and its implementing regulations on our business, results of operations and financial condition continue to be uncertain at this time. department of justice litigation the u.s. department of justice doj and certain states attorneys general have brought an action against us alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against our card products at the point of sale violate the u.s. antitrust laws. see part ii, item 1. legal proceedings for descriptions of the doj action and related cases. visa and mastercard, which were also defendants in the doj and state action, entered into a settlement agreement and have been dismissed as parties pursuant to that agreement. the settlement enjoins visa and mastercard, with certain exceptions, from adopting or enforcing rules or entering into contracts that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to steer cardholders to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale. if similar conditions were imposed on american express, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. other legislative and regulatory initiatives various countries in which we operate have been considering and in some cases adopting legislation and rules that would or do impose changes on certain practices of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks including antitrust actions, legislation to regulate particular practices or prices and the establishment of broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems. regulators and legislators outside the u.s. have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards, including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in four party payment networks, like visa and mastercard , as well as terms of merchant acceptance rules and contracts. although, unlike the visa and mastercard networks, the american express three party payment network does not have interchange fees or collectively set any fees or rules, antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could affect all networks directly or indirectly. broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include, in some cases, requirements for international card networks to be locally licensed and or to localize aspects of their operations. the development and enforcement of regulatory regimes may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global network. 66 table of contents in january 2012, the european commission the commission published a green paper a document to begin a process of consultation toward potential regulation covering a range of issues affecting the payments industry. the commission completed the consultation process and on july 24, 2013, issued its recommendations, which included draft legislation now under consideration within the council of the european union and the european parliament. the commission s recommendations included a number of proposals that would likely have significant impact across the industry and would apply either in whole or in part to american express. the proposed changes include price caps the commission proposed capping interchange fees at 20 basis points for debit and prepaid cards and 30 basis points for credit and charge cards. although american express does not have interchange fees, as four party networks such as visa and mastercard have, the caps would be deemed to apply to elements of the financial arrangements agreed between american express and each gns partner in the european union the eu . the discount rates american express agrees with merchants would not be capped, but the interchange caps could exert downward pressures on merchant fees across the industry, including american express discount rates. the commission proposed to exclude commercial card transactions generally from the scope of these caps. network rules on card acceptance the commission proposed to prohibit honor all cards and anti steering rules across all card networks. in addition, the draft proposals sought harmonization of surcharging rules so that, across the eu, transactions that are subject to the interchange caps may not be surcharged, but transactions falling outside the scope of the caps could be surcharged up to cost. network licensing the commission proposed to require all networks, including three party payment networks that operate with licensing arrangements, which would include our gns business, to establish objective, proportionate and non discriminatory criteria under which a financial institution could qualify to be licensed to operate on the network. in addition, the scope of network licenses would be required to cover the entire eu. these requirements are inconsistent with the flexibility and discretion that american express has had to date in deciding when, where and with whom to grant a license in the gns business. separation of network processing the commission proposed to require card networks to separate their network processing functions in which transactions between different issuers and acquirers are processed for authorization, clearing and settlement . this proposal does not apply to three party payment networks, such as american express, but may be deemed applicable in situations where a different gns issuer and acquirer is involved in a transaction, which represent a very small percentage of transactions on the american express network. further clarification of the applicability of this requirement is needed where, as with gns, licensing arrangements do not give rise to inter bank transactions or relationships. these proposals are currently subject to debate and amendment by the european parliament and council of the european union in a complex legislative process that will also involve the commission. the parliament held a preliminary vote in april 2014 broadly in favor of the commission s proposals with some amendments, including the application of price caps to transactions on three party networks above an unspecified share threshold and three party network cards issued with co brand partners or via agents the inclusion of commercial cards within the scope of price caps and the ability of member states to ban surcharging altogether. the council has yet to establish its position on the proposals and the parliament will need to finalize its position in another vote, before the commission, parliament and council ultimately agree on a compromise text. it is therefore too early to assess the exact scope and impact of any final legislation. in certain countries, such as australia, and in certain member states in the eu, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. while surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions, the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it, and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants. surcharging, particularly where it disproportionately impacts american express card members, which is known as 67 table of contents differential surcharging, could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread. the reserve bank of australia changed the australian surcharging standards beginning march 18, 2013 to allow us and other networks to limit a merchant s right to surcharge to the reasonable cost of card acceptance. in the eu, the consumer rights directive prohibits merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the merchants cost of acceptance in those member states that permit surcharging. although neither a legislative nor regulatory initiative, the settlement by mastercard and visa in a u.s. merchant class litigation required, among other things, mastercard and visa to permit u.s. merchants, subject to certain conditions, to surcharge credit cards, while allowing them to continue to prohibit surcharges on debit and prepaid card transactions. in december 2013, we announced the proposed settlement of a number of u.s. merchant class action lawsuits, which, if approved, would change certain surcharging provisions in our u.s. card acceptance agreements. for a further description of the proposed settlement, see item 1. legal proceedings in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2013. refer to consolidated capital resources and liquidity for

card member loans portfolio excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our card member loans portfolio. asset securitizations asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of receivables or loans to a special purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. the trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset backed securities, that are secured by the transferred receivables or loans. the trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the underlying receivables or loans. the receivables and loans of our charge trust and lending trust being securitized are reported as assets on our consolidated balance sheets. average discount rate this calculation is designed to reflect pricing at merchants accepting general purpose american express cards. it represents the percentage of billed business both proprietary and gns retained by us from merchants we acquire, prior to payments to third parties unrelated to merchant acceptance. basel iii supplementary leverage ratio refer to the capital strategy section under consolidated capital resources and liquidity for

card acceptance agreement for processing card member transactions. the discount fee generally is deducted from our payment reimbursing the merchant for card member purchases. discount revenue is reduced by other payments made to merchants, third party card issuing partners, cash back reward costs, corporate incentive payments and other contra revenue items. four party network a payment network, such as visa or mastercard, in which the card issuer and merchant acquirer are different entities and the network does not have direct relationships with merchants or cardholders. 69 table of contents interest expense interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund card member loans, charge card product receivables, general corporate purposes, and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. interest expense is divided principally into two categories i deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions and ii

principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relates to our performing fixed income securities. interest income is accrued as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so that the related investment security recognizes a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance throughout its term. these amounts are recognized until these securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. interest income on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near term funding requirements in interest bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest bearing demand and call accounts. liquidity coverage ratio

periods of financial and economic stress. merchant acquisition represents the signing of merchants to accept american express branded cards. net card fees represents the card membership fees earned during the period. these fees are recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period typically one year , net of provision for projected refunds for cancellation of card membership. net interest yield on card member loans net interest yield on card member loans is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by adjusted average loans, computed on an annualized basis. the calculation of net interest yield on card member loans includes interest that is deemed uncollectible. for all presentations of net interest yield on card member loans, reserves and net write offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provisions for losses card member loans therefore, such reserves and net write offs are not included in the net interest yield calculation. net

risk market risk is the risk to earnings or value resulting from movements in market prices. our market risk exposure is primarily generated by interest rate risk in our card, insurance and travelers cheque businesses, as well as our investment portfolios, and foreign exchange risk in our operations outside the united states. as described in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2013 refer to item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately 227 million and the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the u.s. dollar related to anticipated overseas operating results for the next 12 months would be approximately 192 million. these sensitivities are based on the 2013 year end positions, and assume that all relevant maturities and types of interest rates and foreign exchange rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously and simultaneously and to the same degree. there were no material changes in these market risks since december 31, 2013. item 4. controls and procedures our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a 15 e and 15d 15 e under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this report. based on such evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a 15 f and 15d 15 f under the exchange act during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. cautionary note regarding forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. the forward looking statements, which address our expected business and financial performance, among other matters, contain words such as believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, may, should, could, would, likely, and similar expressions. readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements. factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following the ability to hold annual operating expense growth to less than 3 percent during 2014, which will depend in part on unanticipated increases in significant categories of operating expenses, such as consulting or professional fees, compliance or regulatory related costs and technology costs, the payment of monetary damages and penalties, disgorgement and restitution, our decision to increase or decrease discretionary operating expenses depending on overall business performance, our ability to achieve the expected benefits of our reengineering plans, which will be impacted by, among other things, the factors identified in the fourth bullet, our ability to balance expense control and investments in the business, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs and results, the impact of accounting changes and reclassifications, and the level of acquisition activity and expenses 72 table of contents the actual amount to be spent by us on investments in the business during 2014, which will be based in part on management s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and make such investments, which could be impacted by business, regulatory or legal complexities, and our performance, the ability to develop and implement technology and other resources to realize efficiencies and the ability to control operating, infrastructure and rewards expenses as business expands or changes, including the changing behavior of card members changes affecting our ability or desire to repurchase up to 2.3 billion of our common shares for the remainder of 2014 and up to 1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2015, such as acquisitions, results of operations, capital needs and the amount of shares issued by us to employees upon the exercise of options, among other factors, which will significantly impact the potential decrease in our capital ratios the possibility of not achieving the expected timing and financial impact of our reengineering plans, which could be caused by factors such as our inability to mitigate the operational and other risks posed by planned staff reductions, our inability to develop and implement technology resources to realize cost savings, underestimating hiring needs related to some of the job positions being eliminated and other employee needs not currently anticipated, lower than expected attrition rates and higher than expected redeployment rates our ability to meet our on average and over time growth targets for revenues net of interest expense, earnings per share and return on average equity, which will depend on factors such as our success in implementing our strategies and business initiatives including growing our share of overall spending, increasing merchant coverage, enhancing our prepaid offerings, expanding the gns business and controlling expenses, and on factors outside management s control including the willingness of card members to sustain spending, the effectiveness of marketing and loyalty programs, regulatory and market pressures on pricing, credit trends, currency and interest rate fluctuations, and changes in general economic conditions, such as gdp growth, consumer confidence, unemployment and the housing market our ability to meet our on average and over time objective to return 50 percent of capital generated to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which will depend on factors such as approval of our capital plans by our regulators, the amount we spend on acquisitions, our results of operations and capital needs in any given period, and the amount of shares issued by us to employees upon the exercise of options uncertainty relating to the outcomes and costs associated with merchant class actions, including the success or failure of the settlement agreement, such as objections to the settlement agreement by plaintiffs and other parties and uncertainty and timing related to the approval of the settlement agreement by the court, which can be impacted by appeals changes in global economic and business conditions, including consumer and business spending, the availability and cost of credit, unemployment and political conditions, all of which may significantly affect spending on american express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and other aspects of our business and results of operations 73 table of contents changes in capital and credit market conditions, including sovereign creditworthiness, which may significantly affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs, expectations regarding capital and liquidity ratios, access to capital and cost of capital, including changes in interest rates changes in market conditions affecting the valuation of our assets or any reduction in our credit ratings or those of our subsidiaries, which could materially increase the cost and other terms of our funding, restrict our access to the capital markets or result in contingent payments under contracts litigation, such as class actions or proceedings brought by governmental and regulatory agencies including the lawsuit filed against us by the u.s. department of justice and certain state attorneys general , that could result in i the imposition of behavioral remedies against us or us voluntarily making certain changes to our business practices, the effects of which in either case could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance ii the imposition of substantial monetary damages and penalties, disgorgement and restitution and or iii damage to our global reputation and brand legal and regulatory developments wherever we do business, including legislative and regulatory reforms in the u.s., such as the establishment of the cfpb and dodd frank s stricter regulation of large, interconnected financial institutions, which could make fundamental changes to many of our business practices or materially affect our capital or liquidity requirements, results of operations, or ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock actions and potential future actions by the fdic and credit rating agencies applicable to securitization trusts, which could impact our abs program or potential changes to the taxation of our businesses, the allowance of deductions for significant expenses, or the incidence of consumption taxes on our transactions, products and services changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry, including competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards, competition for co brand relationships and the success of marketing, promotion or rewards programs changes in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our business partners, such as bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, involving merchants that represent a significant portion of our business, such as the airline industry, or our partners in gns or financial institutions that we rely on for routine funding and liquidity, which could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations the impact of final laws and regulations, if any, arising from the european commission s legislative proposals covering a range of issues affecting the payments industry, which will depend on various factors, including, but not limited to, the issues presented and decisions made in the european legislative and regulatory processes addressing the proposed regulation of interchange fees and other practices related to card based payment transactions, the amount of time these processes take to reach completion, and the actual pricing and other requirements ultimately adopted in the final laws and regulations in the european union and its member states our ability to maintain and expand our presence in the digital payments space, including online and mobile channels, which will depend on our success in evolving our business models and processes for the digital environment, building partnerships and executing programs with companies, and utilizing digital capabilities that can be leveraged for future growth factors beyond our control such as fire, power loss, disruptions in telecommunications, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorism, cyber attacks or fraud, which could significantly affect spending on american express cards, delinquency rates, loan balances and travel related spending or disrupt our global network systems and ability to process transactions and 74 table of contents the potential failure of the u.s. congress to renew legislation regarding the active financing exception to subpart f of the internal revenue code, which could increase our effective tax rate and have an adverse impact on net income. a further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2013 and our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission. part ii. other information item 1. legal proceedings we and our subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings, including class actions, arising out of the conduct of our respective business activities. we believe we have meritorious defenses to each of these actions and intend to defend them vigorously. in the course of our business, we and our subsidiaries are also subject to governmental examinations, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and investigations. we believe we are not a party to, nor are any of our properties the subject of, any pending legal, arbitration, regulatory or investigative proceedings that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity. however, it is possible that the outcome of any such proceeding could have a material impact on results of operations in any particular reporting period as the proceedings are resolved. certain legal proceedings involving us or our subsidiaries are further described in this section and others, for which there have been no subsequent material developments since the filing of our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2013, are described in such report. for those legal proceedings and governmental examinations described in this section and in our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2013, where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to 360 million in excess of the accrued liability if any related to those matters. this aggregate range represents management s estimate of possible loss with respect to these matters and is based on currently available information. this estimated range of possible loss does not represent our maximum loss exposure. the legal proceedings and governmental examinations underlying the estimated range will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from current estimates. for additional information, refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. corporate matters during the last few years as regulatory interest in credit card network pricing to merchants or terms of merchant rules and contracts has increased, we have responded to many inquiries from banking and competition authorities throughout the world. in 2010, the doj, along with attorneys general from arizona, connecticut, hawaii hawaii has since withdrawn its claim , idaho, illinois, iowa, maryland, michigan, missouri, montana, nebraska, new hampshire, ohio, rhode island, tennessee, texas, utah and vermont filed a complaint in the u.s. district court for the eastern district of new york against us, mastercard international incorporated and visa, inc., alleging a violation of section 1 of the sherman antitrust act. the complaint alleges that the defendants policies prohibiting merchants from steering a customer to use another network s card, another type of card or another method of payment anti steering and non discrimination rules and contractual provisions violate the antitrust laws. the complaint seeks a judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from enforcing their anti steering and non discrimination rules and contractual provisions. the complaint does not seek monetary damages. 75 table of contents the doj matter was coordinated pre trial with individual and putative class actions pending in the eastern district of new york against american express brought by merchants alleging that our anti steering provisions in its merchant acceptance agreements with the plaintiffs violate federal antitrust laws. as alleged by the plaintiffs, these provisions prevent merchants from offering consumers incentives to use alternative forms of payment when consumers wish to use an american express branded card. plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief. in july 2004, we were named as a defendant in a putative class action captioned the marcus corporation v. american express company, et al., in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between certain of our charge cards and credit cards in violation of various state and federal laws. the plaintiffs in these actions seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages. in december 2013, we announced a proposed settlement of the marcus case and the putative class actions challenging our anti steering or non discrimination provisions. the settlement, which provides for certain injunctive relief for the proposed classes, received preliminary approval in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york. the final approval hearing is scheduled for september 17, 2014. trial of the doj matter commenced on july 7, 2014. a trial date for the individual merchant actions has not been set. defendants motion for summary judgment in the doj case was denied on may 7, 2014. defendants motion for summary judgment in the individual merchant actions is pending. we are a defendant in a class action captioned kaufman v. american express travel related services, which was filed on february 14, 2007, and is pending in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois. plaintiffs principal allegation is that our gift cards violate consumer protection statutes because consumers allegedly have difficulty in spending small residual amounts on the gift cards prior to the imposition of monthly service fees. the court preliminarily certified a settlement class consisting of with some exceptions all purchasers, recipients and holders of all gift cards issued by american express from january 1, 2002 through the date of preliminary approval of the settlement. we are also a defendant in goodman v. american express travel related services, a putative class action pending in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york, that involves allegations similar to those made in kaufman. plaintiffs in goodman have intervened in the kaufman proceedings and will be subject to any final settlement in kaufman that may be approved over their objections. a final settlement approval hearing was held on june 11, 2014 and we are awaiting decision. u.s. card services and global merchant services matters in july 2004, a purported class action complaint, ross, et al. v. american express company, american express travel related services and american express centurion bank, was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging that we conspired with visa, mastercard and diners club in the setting of foreign currency conversion rates and in the inclusion of arbitration clauses in certain of their cardholder agreements. the suit seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages. the class is defined as all visa, mastercard and diners club general purpose cardholders who used cards issued by any of the mdl defendant banks. american express card members are not part of the class. the settlement of the claims asserted on behalf of the damage class concerning foreign currency conversion rates was approved in 2012. on april 10, 2014, following a trial of the claims asserted by the injunction class concerning cardholder arbitration clauses, the court dismissed plaintiffs claims and granted judgment in favor of us. plaintiffs have appealed. in september 2010, a putative class action, captioned meeks v. american express centurion bank, was filed in fulton county superior court, georgia and later moved to federal court. plaintiffs sought to certify a nationwide class of all american express card members who received unilateral interest rate increases despite their accounts being in good standing. in 2013, two putative class actions, captioned seldes v. american express centurion bank and manhattan steamboat llc v. american express bank, fsb, were filed by plaintiffs making allegations similar to those in meeks and seeking to certify nationwide classes. the parties have reached settlements in these three actions and have advised the relevant courts of their intentions to file stipulations of dismissal with prejudice. 76 table of contents item 1a. risk factors this section supplements and updates certain of the information found under part i, item 1a. risk factors of our annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31, 2013 the 2013 form 10 k and should be read in conjunction with the discussion of risk factors set forth in such section. based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the matter discussed below, together with the risk factors set forth in the 2013 form 10 k, identify the most significant risk factors affecting our company. however, the risks and uncertainties that we face are not limited to those described below and those set forth in the 2013 form 10 k. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities. we have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries, including the airline industry, that represent a significant portion of our business. we are exposed to risks associated with these industries, including bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations and alliances of our partners, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners. we also face substantial and increasingly intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. in the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. for example, we have partnered with costco and delta air lines to offer co branded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our membership rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, including the airline industry, to offer benefits to card member participants. competition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships. we face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources, time and expense in acquiring and developing the relationships, which could result in card member attrition or additional costs to retain card members. we also face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us as competition for such relationships increases. the loss of business partners or the renegotiation of existing relationships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as co brand partners and merchants upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as i our filing for bankruptcy, ii our economic condition deteriorating such that our senior unsecured debt rating is downgraded significantly below investment grade by s p and moody s, iii our ceasing to have a public debt rating, or iv a shortfall in certain performance levels. if we are not able to effectively manage the triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. similarly, we have credit risk to certain co brand partners relating to our prepayments for loyalty program points that may not be fully redeemed. we are also exposed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and services and billed business generally and our financial condition and results of operations. for example, we could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected to reimburse card members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards. the airline industry represents a significant portion of our billed business and in recent years has undergone bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events. the airline industry accounted for approximately 10 percent of our worldwide billed business for the six months ended june 30, 2014. 77 table of contents there continues to be significant consolidation in the airline industry, particularly in the united states e.g., american us airways , through mergers and or grants of antitrust immunity to airline alliances and joint ventures, and this trend could continue. in particular, the united states department of transportation has granted antitrust immunity to members of the skyteam, star and oneworld alliances, enabling the covered airlines to closely coordinate their cross regional operations and to launch highly integrated joint ventures in transatlantic and other markets, including jointly pricing and managing capacity on covered routes, sharing revenues and costs, and coordinating sales and corporate contracts, all outside the scope of the u.s. antitrust laws. the ec has similarly approved the star and oneworld alliances, and its review of the skyteam alliance and cooperation between its members is continuing. increasing consolidation and expanded antitrust immunity could create challenges for our relationships with the airlines, including reducing our profitability on our airline business. airlines are also some of the most important and valuable partners in our membership rewards program. if a participating airline merged with an airline that did not participate in membership rewards, the combined airline would have to determine whether or not to continue participation. similarly, if one of our co brand airline partners merged with an airline that had a competing co brand card, the combined airline would have to determine which co brand cards it would offer. our largest airline co brand loan portfolio, american express delta skymiles credit card, accounted for less than 15 percent of worldwide card member loans as of june 30, 2014. if an airline determined to withdraw from membership rewards, change the terms under which it participates in the program or to cease offering an american express co brand card, whether as the result of a merger or otherwise, such as the withdrawal of continental airlines in 2011 from our airport club access program for centurion and platinum card members and our membership rewards points transfer program or the withdrawal of american airlines in 2014 from our airport club access program for centurion and platinum card members, our business could be adversely affected. for additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry, see risk management exposure to the airline industry on page 44 of our 2013 annual report to
