item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the three months ended june 30, 2002 and 2001 summary amr corporation's amr or the company net loss during the second quarter of 2002 was 495 million, or 3.19 per share, as compared to a net loss of 507 million, or 3.29 per share for the same period in 2001. amr's operating loss of 601 million decreased by 159 million compared to the same period in 2001. the company's 2002 results continue to be adversely impacted by the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting effect on the economy and the air transportation industry. on april 9, 2001, trans world airlines llc twa llc, a wholly owned subsidiary of amr purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of trans world airlines, inc. twa . accordingly, the operating results of twa llc are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the three month period ended june 30, 2002 whereas for 2001 the results of twa llc were included only for the period april 10, 2001 through june 30, 2001. all references to american airlines, inc. include the operations of twa llc since april 10, 2001 collectively, american . amr's second quarter 2001 results include i a 685 million charge 430 million after tax, or 2.79 per share related to the writedown of the carrying value of its fokker 100, saab 340 and atr 42 aircraft and related rotables in accordance with sfas 121, accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of see footnote 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements , and ii a 45 million gain 29 million after tax, or 0.19 per share from the settlement of a legal matter related to the company's 1999 labor disruption. although traffic has continued to increase on significantly reduced capacity since the events of september 11, 2001, the company's second quarter 2002 revenues were down significantly quarter over quarter. in addition to the residual effects of september 11, the company's revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown, seen largely in business travel declines, the geographic distribution of the company's network and reduced fares. in total, the company's revenues decreased 1,104 million, or 19.8 percent, in the second quarter of 2002 as compared to the same period last year. american's passenger revenues decreased by 19.3 percent, or 898 million in the second quarter of 2002 from the same period in 2001. american's domestic revenue per available seat mile rasm decreased 11.9 percent, to 8.47 cents, on a capacity decrease of 8 percent, to 32 billion available seat miles asms . international rasm decreased to 8.67 cents, or 5 percent, on a capacity decrease of 16.2 percent. the decrease in international rasm was due to an 8.6 percent and 3.1 percent decrease in latin american and european rasm, respectively, slightly offset by a 3.2 percent increase in pacific rasm. the decrease in international capacity was driven by a 33.9 percent, 16.2 percent and 12.3 percent reduction in pacific, european and latin american asms, respectively. amr eagle's passenger revenues decreased 15.9 percent, or 65 million. amr eagle's traffic increased 2.8 percent while capacity decreased 5 percent, to approximately 1.6 billion asms. as with american, the decrease in amr eagle's revenues was due primarily to the continued impact of the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the economic slowdown. cargo revenues decreased 48 million, or 25.3 percent, primarily due to the same reasons as noted above. other revenues decreased 27.4 percent, or 93 million, due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that american performs for other airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel service charges. 8 results of operations continued the company's operating expenses decreased 19.9 percent, or 1,263 million. american's cost per asm increased 0.5 percent to 10.78 cents, excluding the impact of the second quarter 2001 asset impairment charge. wages, salaries and benefits remained flat quarter over quarter, reflecting i a decrease in the average number of equivalent employees, somewhat offset by higher salaries, and ii increases in the company's pension and health insurance costs, the latter reflecting rapidly rising medical care and prescription drug costs. aircraft fuel expense decreased 22.1 percent, or 186 million, due primarily to an 11.6 percent decrease in the company's fuel consumption and a 9.4 percent decrease in the company's average price per gallon of fuel. food service decreased 17.4 percent, or 38 million, due primarily to the company's reduced operating schedule and change in level of food service. commissions to agents decreased 40.4 percent, or 105 million, due primarily to a 19.1 percent decrease in passenger revenues and commission structure changes implemented in march 2002. special charges of 685 million related to the writedown of the carrying value of the company's fokker 100, saab 340 and atr 42 aircraft and related rotables during the second quarter of 2001 see footnote 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements . other operating expenses decreased 19.3 percent, or 196 million, due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that american performs for other airlines, and decreases in travel and incidental costs, credit card and booking fees, advertising and promotion costs, and data processing expenses, which were partially offset by higher insurance and security costs. other income expense increased 86 million due to the following interest income decreased 25 percent, or 6 million, due primarily to decreases in interest rates. interest expense increased 32 million, or 24.2 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in the company's long term debt. interest capitalized decreased 16 million, or 42.1 percent, due primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits for flight equipment. miscellaneous net decreased 86.5 percent, or 32 million, due primarily to a 45 million gain recorded during the second quarter of 2001 from the settlement of a legal matter related to the company's 1999 labor disruption. the effective tax rate for the three months ended june 30, 2002 was impacted by a 30 million charge resulting from a provision in congress' economic stimulus package that changes the period for carrybacks of net operating losses nols . this change allows the company to carry back 2001 and 2002 nols for five years, rather than two years under the existing law, allowing the company to more quickly recover its nols. the extended nol carryback did however, result in the displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years. these credits are now expected to expire before being utilized by the company, resulting in this charge. 9 results of operations continued operating

operations continued for the six months ended june 30, 2002 and 2001 summary amr's loss before cumulative effect of accounting change for the six months ended june 30, 2002 was 1,070 million, or 6.90 per share, as compared to a net loss of 550 million, or 3.58 per share, for the same period in 2001. amr's operating loss for the six months ended june 30, 2002 was 1,330 million, compared to an operating loss of 764 million for the same period in 2001. the company's 2002 results continue to be adversely impacted by the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting effect on the economy and the air transportation industry. on april 9, 2001, twa llc purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of twa. accordingly, the operating results of twa llc are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the six month period ended june 30, 2002 whereas for 2001 the results of twa llc were included only for the period april 10, 2001 through june 30, 2001. in addition, the company recorded a one time, non cash charge of 988 million net of tax , reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change, to write off all of amr's goodwill. amr's 2001 results include i a 685 million charge 430 million after tax, or 2.79 per share related to the writedown of the carrying value of its fokker 100, saab 340 and atr 42 aircraft and related rotables, and ii a 45 million gain 29 million after tax, or 0.19 per share from the settlement of a legal matter related to the company's 1999 labor disruption. although traffic has continued to increase on significantly reduced capacity since the events of september 11, 2001, the company's 2002 revenues were down significantly year over year. in addition to the residual effects of september 11, the company's revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown, seen largely in business travel declines, the geographic distribution of the company's network and reduced fares. in total, the company's revenues decreased 1,728 million, or 16.7 percent, in 2002 versus the same period in 2001. american's passenger revenues decreased by 15.7 percent, or 1,349 million in 2002 as compared to the same period in 2001. american's domestic rasm decreased 13.4 percent, to 8.58 cents, on a capacity decrease of 0.4 percent, to 61.3 billion asms. international rasm decreased to 8.67 cents, or 7.7 percent, on a capacity decrease of 14 percent. the decrease in international rasm was due to a 10.2 percent and 7.9 percent decrease in latin american and european rasm, respectively, slightly offset by a 5.6 percent increase in pacific rasm. the decrease in international capacity was driven by a 36.4 percent, 15.2 percent and 8.2 percent reduction in pacific, european and latin american asms, respectively. amr eagle's passenger revenues decreased 14.9 percent, or 114 million. amr eagle's traffic increased 4.7 percent while capacity decreased 3.2 percent, to approximately 3.2 billion asms. as with american, the decrease in amr eagle's revenues was due primarily to the continued impact of the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the economic slowdown. cargo revenues decreased 90 million, or 24.6 percent, primarily due to the same reasons as noted above. other revenues decreased 27.6 percent, or 175 million, due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that american performs for other airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel service charges. 11 results of operations continued the company's operating expenses decreased 10.5 percent, or approximately 1,162 million. american's cost per asm increased by 0.5 percent to 11.03 cents, excluding the impact of the second quarter 2001 asset impairment charge. wages, salaries and benefits increased 8.6 percent, or 334 million, reflecting i a decrease in the average number of equivalent employees, somewhat offset by higher salaries, and ii increases in the company's pension and health insurance costs, the latter reflecting rapidly rising medical care and prescription drug costs. aircraft fuel expense decreased 23.6 percent, or 366 million, due primarily to a 16.1 percent decrease in the company's average price per gallon of fuel and a 6.1 percent decrease in the company's fuel consumption. aircraft rentals increased 66 million, or 17.6 percent, due primarily the addition of twa aircraft. food service decreased 12.9 percent, or 52 million, due primarily to the company's reduced operating schedule and change in level of food service. commissions to agents decreased 34.7 percent, or 168 million, due primarily to a 15.7 percent decrease in passenger revenues and commission structure changes implemented in march 2002. special charges of 685 million related to the writedown of the carrying value of the company's fokker 100, saab 340 and atr 42 aircraft and related rotables during the second quarter of 2001. other operating expenses decreased 15.4 percent, or 296 million, due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that american performs for other airlines, and decreases in travel and incidental costs, credit card and booking fees, advertising and promotion costs, and data processing expenses, which were partially offset by higher insurance and security costs. other income expense increased 167 million due to the following interest income decreased 43.8 percent, or 28 million, due primarily to decreases in interest rates. interest expense increased 79 million, or 31.5 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in the company's long term debt. interest capitalized decreased 35 million, or 44.3 percent, due primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits for flight equipment. miscellaneous net decreased 25 million due primarily to a 45 million gain recorded during the second quarter of 2001 from the settlement of a legal matter related to the company's 1999 labor disruption and the write down of certain investments held by the company during the first quarter of 2001. the effective tax rate for the six months ended june 30, 2002 was impacted by a 57 million charge resulting from a provision in congress' economic stimulus package that changes the period for carrybacks of nols. this change allows the company to carry back 2001 and 2002 nols for five years, rather than two years under the existing law, allowing the company to more quickly recover its nols. the extended nol carryback did however, result in the displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years. these credits are now expected to expire before being utilized by the company, resulting in this charge. 12 results of operations continued operating statistics six

and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities in the six month period ended june 30, 2002 was 86 million, a decrease of 799 million over the same period in 2001, due primarily to an increase in the company's net loss. included in net cash provided by operating activities during the first six months of 2002 was approximately 658 million received by the company as a result of the utilization of its 2001 nol's. capital expenditures for the first six months of 2002 were 1,113 million, and included the acquisition of seven boeing 757 200s, three boeing 777 200ers, 15 embraer 140s and four bombardier crj 700 aircraft. these capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and debt agreements. proceeds from the sale of equipment and property of 162 million include the proceeds received upon delivery of three mcdonnell douglas md 11 aircraft to fedex. as of june 30, 2002, the company had commitments to acquire the following aircraft 47 boeing 737 800s, 11 boeing 777 200ers, nine boeing 767 300ers, 109 embraer regional jets and 20 bombardier crj 700s. deliveries of these aircraft are scheduled to continue through 2008. payments for these aircraft are expected to be approximately 505 million during the remainder of 2002, 1.5 billion in 2003, 1.1 billion in 2004 and an aggregate of approximately 2.1 billion in 2005 through 2008. in june 2002, standard poor's downgraded the credit ratings of amr and american, and the credit ratings of a number of other major airlines. the long term credit ratings of amr and american were removed from standard poor's credit watch with negative implications and were given a negative outlook. any additional reductions in amr's or american's credit ratings could result in increased borrowing costs to the company and might limit the availability of future financing needs. 13 in addition to the company's approximately 2.6 billion in cash and short term investments as of june 30, 2002, the company has available a variety of future financing sources, including, but not limited to i the receipt of the remainder of the u.s. government grant authorized by the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the act , which is estimated to be in excess of 40 million, ii additional secured aircraft debt, iii the availability of the company's 1 billion credit facility, iv sale leaseback transactions of owned property, including aircraft and real estate, v the recovery of past federal income taxes paid as a result of a provision in the recently passed economic stimulus package regarding nol carrybacks, vi tax exempt borrowings for airport facilities, vii securitization of future operating receipts, and viii unsecured borrowings. no assurance can be given that any of these financing sources will be available on terms acceptable to the company. however, the company believes it will meet its current financing needs. pursuant to the act, the government made available to air carriers, subject to certain conditions, up to 10 billion in federal government guarantees of certain loans. american did not seek such loan guarantees. other information as a result of the september 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers have significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events war risk coverage . at the same time, they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general. pursuant to authority granted in the act, the government has supplemented the commercial war risk insurance until august 17, 2002 with a third party liability policy to cover losses to persons other than employees or passengers for renewable 60 day periods. in the event the insurance carriers reduce further the amount of insurance coverage available or the government fails to renew war risk insurance, the company's operations and or financial position, results of operations or cash flows would be adversely impacted. as discussed in the company's 2001 form 10 k, a provision in the current allied pilots association apa contract freezes the number of asms and block hours flown on american's two letter marketing code by american's regional carrier partners when american pilots are on furlough the asm cap . as amr eagle continues to accept previously ordered regional jets, this asm cap would be reached sometime in 2002, necessitating actions to insure compliance with the asm cap. american is working with its regional partners to accomplish this. actions currently being taken and considered by amr eagle to reduce its capacity are discussed in the company's 2001 form 10 k. in addition, american is removing its code from flights of the americanconnection carriers, which are independent carriers that provide feed to american's st. louis hub. american believes that the combination of these actions will enable it to comply with this asm cap through 2002 and for sometime beyond. in addition, another provision in the current apa contract limits the total number of regional jets with more than 44 seats flown under the american code by american's regional carrier partners to 67 aircraft. similar to the above, as amr eagle continues to accept previously ordered bombardier crj aircraft, this cap would be reached in early 2003. in order to ensure american remains in compliance with this provision, amr eagle has reached an agreement in principle to dispose of 14 embraer 145 aircraft. ultimately, these airplanes will be acquired by trans states airlines, an americanconnection carrier. trans states airlines will operate these aircraft under its two letter airline code and expects to deploy these aircraft at its st. louis hub where it feeds american. the potential transaction still requires the consent of certain third parties, including the companies financing these aircraft, and is subject to the negotiation of final documentation. 14 outlook capacity for american is expected to be down approximately two percent in the third quarter of 2002 compared to last year's third quarter levels. amr eagle's third quarter capacity will be down about one percent from last year's levels. for the third quarter of 2002, the company expects traffic to be about flat as compared to last year's third quarter levels. pressure to reduce costs will continue, although the company will continue to see higher benefit and security costs, increased insurance premiums, and greater interest expense. however, the company expects to see a slight decrease in fuel prices as compared to the third quarter of 2001 and the continued decline in commission expense due to the commission changes implemented earlier in 2002. in total, american's unit costs, excluding special charges, for the third quarter of 2002 are expected to be down approximately 3.5 percent from last year's third quarter level. notwithstanding the expected decrease in unit costs however, given the revenue pressures seen in the first half of the year and expected to continue into the third quarter, the company expects to incur a sizable loss in the third quarter and a significant loss for 2002. in response to these financial challenges, the company has undertaken a comprehensive review of its business to better align its cost structure with the current revenue environment, aimed at improving productivity, simplifying operations and reducing costs. the company has begun to implement certain of these changes, including a fleet simplification program, adjustments to its operating schedule and increased airport automation, and will continue to refine its business throughout the coming months. forward looking information statements in this report contain various forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the
