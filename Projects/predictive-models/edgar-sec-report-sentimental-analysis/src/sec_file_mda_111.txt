item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the three months ended march 31, 2002 and 2001 summary amr corporation's amr or the company loss before cumulative effect of accounting change during the first quarter of 2002 was 575 million, or 3.71 per share, as compared to a net loss of 43 million, or 0.28 per share for the same period in 2001. amr's operating loss of 729 million increased 725 million compared to the same period in 2001. the company's 2002 results continue to be adversely impacted by the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. in addition, on april 9, 2001, american airlines, inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of amr purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of trans world airlines, inc. twa . accordingly, the operating results of twa are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the three month period ended march 31, 2002 but not for the three month period ended march 31, 2001. all references to american airlines, inc. include twa collectively, american . in addition, effective january 1, 2002, the company recorded a one time, non cash charge of 988 million net of tax , reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change, to write off all of amr's goodwill. although traffic has continued to increase on significantly reduced capacity since the events of september 11, 2001, the company's first quarter 2002 revenues were down significantly year over year. in addition to the residual effects of september 11, the company's revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown seen largely in business travel declines and an increase in fare sale activity. in total, the company's revenues decreased 624 million, or 13.1 percent, in the first quarter of 2002 from the same period last year. american's passenger revenues decreased by 11.5 percent, or 451 million in the first three months of 2002 from the same period in 2001. american's domestic revenue per available seat mile rasm decreased 15.4 percent, to 8.7 cents, on a capacity increase of 9.4 percent, to 29.3 billion available seat miles asms . international rasm decreased to 8.66 cents, or 10.6 percent, on a capacity decrease of 11.4 percent. the decrease in international rasm was due to a 14.1 percent decrease and 11.9 percent decrease in european and latin american rasm, respectively, slightly offset by a 9 percent increase in pacific rasm. the decrease in international capacity was driven by a 39.5 percent, 13.9 percent and 4 percent reduction in pacific, european and latin american asms, respectively. amr eagle's passenger revenues decreased 13.8 percent, or 49 million. amr eagle's traffic increased 6.9 percent while capacity decreased 1.3 percent, to approximately 1.6 billion asms. as with american, the decrease in amr eagle's revenues was due primarily to the continued impact of the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the economic slowdown. cargo revenues decreased 42 million, or 23.9 percent, for the same reasons as noted above. other revenues decreased 27.8 percent, or 82 million, due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that american performs for other airlines, and decreases in codeshare revenue and employee travel service charges. the company's operating expenses increased 2.1 percent, or 101 million. american's cost per asm increased 0.4 percent to 11.30 cents. wages, salaries and benefits increased 19.1 percent, or 334 million, primarily due to contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the company's labor contracts. in addition, the company experienced increases in its pension and health insurance costs, the latter reflecting rapidly rising medical care and prescription drug costs. aircraft fuel expense decreased 25.5 percent, or 180 million, due primarily to a 23.3 percent decrease in the company's average price per gallon of fuel. other rentals and landing fees increased 12.5 percent, or 32 million, due to higher facilities rent and landing fees across american's system. aircraft rentals increased 78 million, or 52.7 percent, due primarily to the addition of twa aircraft. commissions to agents decreased 28.1 percent, or 63 million, due primarily to an 11.7 percent decrease in passenger revenues and a decrease in the percentage of commissionable transactions. other operating expenses decreased 11 percent, or 100 million, due primarily to decreases in contract maintenance work that american performs for other airlines, and decreases in travel and incidental costs, advertising and promotion costs, and credit card fees, which were partially offset by higher insurance and security costs. 8 other income expense , historically a net expense, increased 81 million due to the following interest income decreased 55 percent, or 22 million, due primarily to decreases in interest rates. interest expense increased 47 million, or 39.5 percent, resulting primarily from the increase in the company's long term debt. interest capitalized decreased 19 million, or 46.3 percent, due primarily to a decrease in purchase deposits for flight equipment. miscellaneous net decreased 46.7 percent, or 7 million, due to the write down of certain investments held by the company during the first quarter of 2001. the effective tax rate for the three months ended march 31, 2002 was impacted by a 27 million charge resulting from a provision in congress' economic stimulus package that changes the period for carrybacks of net operating losses nols . this change allows the company to carry back 2001 and 2002 nols for five years, rather than two years under the existing law, allowing the company to more quickly recover its nols. the extended nol carryback did, however, result in the displacement of foreign tax credits taken in prior years. these credits are now expected to expire before being utilized by the company, resulting in this charge. operating statistics three months ended march 31, 2002 2001 american airlines revenue passenger miles millions 27,817 26,452 available seat miles

the company as of march 31, 2002 19 owned boeing 727 200s, 15 operating leased mcdonnell douglas dc 9s, 19 operating leased boeing 717 200s, nine owned mcdonnell douglas dc 10 10s, four operating leased mcdonnell douglas md 80s, three owned mcdonnell douglas md 11s, two owned mcdonnell douglas dc 10 30s, and four owned, six capital leased and two operating leased saab 340bs. liquidity and capital resources net cash used for operating activities in the three month period ended march 31, 2002 was 406 million, an increase of 425 million over the same period in 2001, due primarily to an increase in the company's net loss. capital expenditures for the first three months of 2002 were 619 million, and included the acquisition of six boeing 757 200s, two boeing 777 200ers, seven embraer 140s and two bombardier crj 700 aircraft. these capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and debt agreements. as of march 31, 2002, the company had commitments to acquire the following aircraft 47 boeing 737 800s, 12 boeing 777 200ers, nine boeing 767 300ers, one boeing 757 200, 117 embraer regional jets and 22 bombardier crj 700s. deliveries of these aircraft are scheduled to continue through 2008. payments for these aircraft are expected to be approximately 825 million during the remainder of 2002, 1.7 billion in 2003, 1.2 billion in 2004 and an aggregate of approximately 1.9 billion in 2005 through 2008. other information in addition to the company's approximately 2.3 billion in cash and short term investments as of march 31, 2002, the company has available a variety of future financing sources, including, but not limited to i the receipt of the remainder of the u.s. government grant authorized by the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the act , which is estimated to be in excess of 100 million, ii additional secured aircraft debt, iii the availability of the company's 1 billion credit facility, iv sale leaseback transactions of owned property, including aircraft and real estate, v the recovery of past federal income taxes paid as a result of a provision in the recently passed economic stimulus package regarding nol carrybacks in april 2002, the company received approximately 393 million related to the utilization of its remaining 2001 nol , vi tax exempt borrowings for airport facilities, vii securitization of future operating receipts, viii unsecured borrowings, and ix borrowings backed by federal loan guarantees as provided under the act. no assurance can be given that any of these financing sources will be available on terms acceptable to the company. however, the company believes it will meet its current financing needs. 10 as a result of the september 11, 2001 events, aviation insurers have significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events war risk coverage . at the same time, they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general. pursuant to authority granted in the act, the government has supplemented the commercial war risk insurance until may 19, 2002 with a third party liability policy to cover losses to persons other than employees or passengers for renewable 60 day periods. in the event the insurance carriers reduce further the amount of insurance coverage available or the government fails to renew war risk insurance, the company's operations and or financial position, results of operations or cash flows would be adversely impacted. as discussed in the company's 2001 form 10 k, a provision in the current allied pilots association contract further limits the number of asms and block hours flown by american's regional carrier partners when american pilots are on furlough. as amr eagle continues to accept previously ordered regional jets, this will cause the asm cap to be reached sometime in the first half of 2002, necessitating actions to comply with that cap. american is working with its regional partners to ensure that it is in compliance with this provision. actions currently being taken and considered by amr eagle to reduce its capacity are discussed in the company's 2001 form 10 k. in addition, american is removing its code from flights of the american connection carriers, which are independent carriers that provide feed to american's st. louis hub. american believes that the combination of all these actions will enable it to comply with the asm cap through 2002 and for sometime beyond. outlook capacity for american is expected to be down approximately 11 percent in the second quarter of 2002 compared to last year's second quarter levels. amr eagle's second quarter capacity will be down about three percent from last year's levels. for the second quarter of 2002, the company expects traffic to be lower by approximately 11 percent as compared to last year's second quarter levels. pressure to reduce costs will continue, although the company will continue to see higher wages, salaries and benefit costs, higher security costs and insurance premiums, and greater interest expense. although the company expects to see an increase in fuel prices as compared to the first quarter of 2002, fuel prices are expected to remain lower in the second quarter of 2002 as compared to last year's second quarter prices. further, the company expects to see a benefit in commission expense due to the domestic base commission changes implemented in march 2002. in total however, american's unit costs for the second quarter of 2002 are expected to be two to three percent higher than last year's second quarter. given this higher unit cost, coupled with the revenue pressures seen in the first quarter and expected to continue into the second quarter, the company expects to incur a loss in the second quarter although the company does not expect this loss to be of the same magnitude as the company's first quarter loss , and will likely incur a loss for 2002. forward
