item 2. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the three months ended march 31, 2001 and 2000 summary amr's loss from continuing operations during the first quarter of 2001 was 43 million, or 0.28 loss per share, as compared to income from continuing operations of 89 million, or 0.57 per share diluted, for the same period in 2000. amr's operating income of 17 million decreased 195 million compared to the same period in 2000. the company's revenues increased 183 million, or 4.0 percent, in the first quarter of 2001 versus the same period last year. american's passenger revenues increased by 4.3 percent, or 161 million. american's yield the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile of 14.88 cents increased by 6.7 percent compared to the same period in 2000. domestic yields increased 6.6 percent from the first quarter of 2000. international yields increased 6.8 percent, primarily due to an increase of 7.9 percent and 7.1 percent in european and latin american yields, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of approximately 1.0 percent in pacific yields. yields were up year over year largely due to fare increases enacted over the course of 2000. american's traffic or revenue passenger miles rpms decreased 2.1 percent to 26.5 billion miles for the quarter ended march 31, 2001. american's capacity or available seat miles asms of 39.0 billion miles decreased 2.6 percent compared to the first quarter of 2000. american's domestic traffic decreased 3.7 percent on a capacity decrease of 2.7 percent and international traffic increased 1.4 percent on a capacity decrease of 2.4 percent. the decrease in domestic traffic was due to a slowing u.s. economy, softening the demand for air travel. the increase in international traffic was driven by a 6.9 percent increase in traffic to the pacific on a capacity decrease of 3.5 percent, a 0.7 percent increase in traffic to europe on a capacity increase of 0.1 percent and a 0.9 percent increase in traffic to latin america on a capacity decrease of 4.1 percent. the overall decrease in capacity was due primarily to the company's more room throughout coach program, partially offset by an increase in the number of aircraft. the company's operating expenses increased 8.7 percent, or 378 million. american's cost per asm increased 11.7 percent to 11.21 cents, partially driven by a reduction in asms due to the company's more room throughout coach program. adjusted for this program, american's cost per asm grew approximately 5.7 percent. wages, salaries and benefits increased 8.0 percent, or 129 million, primarily due to an increase in the average number of equivalent employees, contractual wage rate and seniority increases that are built into the company's labor contracts, partially offset by a decrease in provision for profit sharing of approximately 28 million. aircraft fuel expense increased 24.1 percent, or 133 million, due to a 21.5 percent increase in the company's average price per gallon and a 2.2 percent increase in the company's fuel consumption. the increase in fuel expense is net of gains of approximately 47 million recognized during the first quarter of 2001 related to the company's fuel hedging program. commissions to agents decreased 12.8 percent, or 33 million, despite an increase of approximately 4.3 percent in passenger revenues, due primarily to the continued benefit from commission structure changes implemented in 2000 and a decrease in the percentage of commissionable transactions. other operating expense increased 12.6 percent, or 101 million, due primarily to increases in external contract maintenance, outsourced services, data processing, and travel and incidental costs. other income expense , historically a net expense, increased 19 million, or 34.5 percent, due to an increase in interest income of 8 million, or 25.0 percent, relating primarily to the trans world airlines, inc. twa debtor in possession financing which partially offsets approximately 21 million of sfas 133 adjustments as a result of the company's ineffectiveness and time value adjustments associated with its fuel hedging program see footnote 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements and an increase of 9 million in miscellaneous net relating primarily to the write down of certain investments held by the company. the effective tax rates for the three months ended march 31, 2001 and 2000 were based upon the operating results for such periods. as such, the effective tax rates do not represent estimated annual effective tax rates. 10 13 operating statistics three months ended march 31, 2001 2000 american airlines revenue passenger miles millions 26,452

activities in the three month period ended march 31, 2001 was 19 million, a decrease of 502 million over the same period in 2000, due primarily to a decrease in the company's working capital and a decrease in income from continuing operations. capital expenditures for the first three months of 2001 were 847 million, and included the acquisition of seven boeing 737 800s, four boeing 777 200ers and seven embraer 135 aircraft. these capital expenditures were financed primarily through secured mortgage and debt agreements. as of march 31, 2001, the company had commitments to acquire the following aircraft 62 boeing 737 800s, 23 boeing 757 200s, 16 boeing 777 200ers, 145 embraer regional jets and 25 bombardier crj 700s. deliveries of all aircraft continue through 2006. payments for all aircraft will approximate 2.1 billion during the remainder of 2001, 1.7 billion in 2002, 950 million in 2003 and an aggregate of approximately 1.4 billion in 2004 through 2006. the company expects to fund its remaining 2001 capital expenditures from the company's existing cash and short term investments, internally generated cash or new financing depending upon market conditions and the company's evolving view of its long term needs. other information on january 10, 2001, the company announced three transactions that would substantially increase the scope of its existing network. the first of these transactions was consummated on april 9, 2001 when the company purchased substantially all of the assets of twa for approximately 625 million in cash subject to certain working capital adjustments , including the satisfaction of 312 million in debtor in possession financing, and assumed certain liabilities. the company funded the acquisition of twa's assets with its existing cash and short term investments. the company does not expect the acquisition of twa to have a significantly accretive or dilutive impact on the company's 2001 earnings. although twa has historically reported net losses and the acquisition of twa will result in the incurrence of integration costs, the company expects to realize certain synergies from the acquisition, including, among other things, improved passenger revenues and a reduction in rental expense from the renegotiated lease obligations. secondly, the company announced that it has agreed to acquire from united airlines, inc. united certain key strategic assets slots, gates and aircraft of us airways group, inc. us airways upon the consummation of the previously announced merger between united and us airways. in addition to the acquisition of these assets, american will lease a number of slots and gates from united so that american may operate half of the northeast shuttle new york washington dc boston . united will operate the other half of the shuttle. for these assets, american will pay approximately 1.2 billion in cash to united and assume approximately 300 million in aircraft operating leases. the consummation of these transactions is contingent upon the closing of the proposed united us airways merger, which is no longer expected to occur in the second quarter of 2001. also, the acquisition of aircraft is dependent upon certain rights of united to exclude aircraft from the transactions and also is generally dependent upon a certain number of us airways' boeing 757 cockpit crew members transferring to american's payroll. finally, american has agreed to acquire a 49 percent stake in, and to enter into an exclusive marketing agreement with, d.c. air, llc dc air . american has agreed to pay 82 million in cash for its ownership stake. american will have a right of first refusal on the acquisition of the remaining 51 percent stake in dc air. american will also lease to dc air a certain number of fokker 100 aircraft with necessary crews known in the industry as a wet lease . these wet leased aircraft will be used by dc air in its operations. dc air is the first significant new entrant at ronald reagan washington national airport dca in over a decade. dc air will acquire the assets needed to begin its dca operations from united us airways upon the consummation of the merger between the two carriers. american's investment in dc air and the other arrangements described above are contingent upon the consummation of the merger between united and us airways and upon execution of definitive documentation between dc air and united which has not yet occurred . 12 15 as a result of the above transactions, and for several other reasons, american and american eagle have initiated an impairment review of certain fleet types in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no. 121, accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of. this review, which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2001, could result in an impairment charge to be taken by the company. the size of any resulting 2001 charge is not presently known, but may be significant. forward looking information statements in this report contain various forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of
