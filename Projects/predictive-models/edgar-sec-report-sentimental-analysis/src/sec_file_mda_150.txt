segments, biospherix and infospherix. biospherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications. infospherix provides contact center information and reservation services for government and industry, with substantially all of infospherix revenue generated from government customers. biospherix engages in product development, notably tagatose. the company s current focus is on the non food use of tagatose, which we will market under the name naturlose . our principal efforts have been to explore whether naturlose is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes. in april 2007, the company commenced a phase 3 trial for this purpose. infospherix has developed a niche in providing campground and other reservation services via its reserveworld business line and is one of only two major suppliers of campground reservation services in the u.s. reservation contracts make up over 50 of the company s revenue. the reservation services contracts have revenue streams that are historically greater in the spring and summer months when vacation planning is more prevalent. these reservation contracts have certain fixed costs that continue throughout the year such as depreciation, telephone and computer related service and maintenance contracts, and minimum staffing requirements. these contracts also incur certain costs in advance of the peak seasons in order to staff up and train the work force that will be needed during the peak seasons. on january 23, 2007, the company concluded its long standing national park service contract. the national park service contract contributed approximately 4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended december 31, 2006 and 2005, and 174,000 and 794,000 in revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. in april 2007, the company committed to a plan to sell the infospherix subsidiary and on april 17, 2007 signed a non binding letter of intent to sell the infospherix. the sale will allow spherix to focus all of its efforts on the biospherix division s biotechnology products, with the principal focus on the commercialization of naturlose. the company is in negotiations regarding the terms of the sale and the sale is subject to several contingencies, including execution of a definitive agreement of sale, and approval of the transaction by the company s stockholders. the sale is expected to close by the end of the summer of 2007. the infospherix segment see note 7 comprises the majority of the company s operations. results of operations for the three months ended march 31, 2007 and 2006 revenue and direct contract and operating costs see infospherix below. selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march 31, 2007, were consistent with those of the same period of the prior year. the company s selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management salaries and fringes, sales and marketing costs, finance and accounting, and human resources, as well as costs related to being a public company. research and development see biospherix below. 9 interest interest income increased 101,000 between years as a direct result of the increased cash invested, principally generated by the 6 million settlement award with the department of agriculture in october 2006. three months ended march 31, 2007 2006 revenue 5,347,000 5,919,000 direct cost and operating expense 4,916,000 4,921,000 gross margin 431,000 998,000 infospherix revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2007, decreased 575,000 9.7 from the same period in 2006 due to the completion of the national park service contract, which concluded on january 23, 2007. reductions from the direct costs associated with the national park service contract were off set by increased costs under the new michigan contract and additional costs incurred under the contracts transferred from the former south dakota facility to the new facility in indiana. the national park service contract contributed approximately 4.0 million in revenue for each of the years ended december 31, 2006 and 2005, and 174,000 and 794,000 in revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. biospherix the primary focus of biospherix s research and development r d activities for the three months ended march 31, 2007, has been on the planning and preparation of a phase 3 clinical trial in the use of naturlose for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. the company has completed a dose range finding study, and the recruitment of patients for the trial, which will take place in australia and the united states, is on going. the first participants began the phase 3 clinical trial in april 2007. more than 400 subjects from the united states and abroad, representing the demographic mix in the u.s., will receive oral doses of naturlose to test its ability to treat type 2 diabetes. a phase 3 clinical trial, which gathers evidence regarding effectiveness and safety, is needed to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of new drugs proposed to the fda. the company believes its chances for a successful outcome are enhanced by the widely demonstrated safety of the product, lack of safety being the primary cause for failure of most drug candidates. in 2005, the company contracted with the university of maryland school of dentistry to conduct a human clinical trial on the oral anti plaque efficacy of naturlose. the study demonstrated tagatose to be much more resistant to oral bacteria, which form plaque, than is sorbitol, a sugar substitute that is widely used in oral care products. the study suggested ways of modifying the naturlose product to effect desired plaque reduction. such modifications have been made, and the company has arranged with the university of maryland school of dentistry to conduct a trial of naturlose toothpaste formulated by the company in an attempt to establish an anti plaque claim for the toothpaste. the clinical trial started in early 2007. in the first quarter of 2007, the company expended 1.4 million in furtherance of its biospherix r d activities, as compared to 105,000 in the first quarter of 2006. the increased level of expenditures is primarily attributable to the phase 3 trial. liquidity and capital resources, consolidated on march 31, 2006, the company entered into a new agreement with bank of america the bank to establish a line of credit new agreement for its subsidiary, infospherix incorporated, with the outstanding borrowings under the old line of credit transferred to the new agreement. the new agreement, which matures june 30, 2008, provides for borrowings up to 1.5 million, is collateralized by the subsidiary s accounts receivables and equipment, and contains covenants on tangible net worth and funded debt to ebitda ratios. such covenants could have a limiting effect on the amount of cash that the subsidiary can advance to spherix. the interest rate under the agreement is based on the libor daily floating rate plus 3 approximately 8.5 at march 31, 2007 . the company had no outstanding borrowings under the agreement at march 31, 2007, and the total amount available for future advances to the subsidiary was 1.5 million under the agreement. 10 working capital as of march 31, 2007, was 9.5 million, which represents a 1.4 million decrease from working capital of 10.9 million at december 31, 2006. the decrease in working capital was largely related to the company s phase 3 clinical trial costs. spherix expects to expend up to 5 million over the next year in costs related to the phase 3 clinical trial and other r d activity. the clinical trial is expected to take at least two years to complete. the company intends to finance the biospherix activities through spherix s cash reserves, proceeds from the issuance of common stock, and proceeds from the sale of the infospherix subsidiary. the company also intends to seek pharmaceutical partners to assist in completing development of the biospherix products. infospherix incorporated intends to finance its furniture and equipment needs through financing or leasing arrangements where practicable, including those related to the start up costs of new contracts the company may win. cash flow for the three months ended march 31, 2007, reflects a net cash outflow of 1.1 million, consisting of 1.5 million used in operating activities, 552,000 used in investing activities, and 1 million provided by financing activities. the increase in cash used by operating activities in 2007 from that of the prior year is primarily related to the cost of the phase 3 clinical trial. cash used in investing activities was consistent with that of the prior year. cash flows from financing activities in 2006 included proceeds from the issuance of warrants. trends and outlooks biospherix biospherix s primary emphasis is on a phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate that naturlose is a successful treatment for type 2 diabetes. the first participants have already been enrolled and the trial began in april 2007. costs of conducting the phase 3 trial have substantially increased as we have obtained further direction from the fda concerning the processes to be employed in the trial. the company expects to spend up to 5 million in r d costs over the next year. the company intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the infospherix subsidiary to fund the phase 3 trial. if the sale is not concluded, the company will need to reassess continuation of the tests in view of the increased costs of the tests and the expected follow on costs in pursuit of fda approval. infospherix the company concluded the national park service contract on january 23, 2007. the national park service contract contributed approximately 4 million in revenue for each of the years ended december 31, 2006 and 2005. the loss of the national park service contract will have an adverse effect on the company s financial results in comparison to the prior year. since 1998, infospherix has grown its government park reservation business from one contract to 17 government reservation contracts. infospherix s reservation business accounted for over 60 of the company s revenue in 2006 and 2005, and over 50 for the three months ended march 31, 2007. infospherix is now one of only two major suppliers of government campground reservation services in the u.s. on february 6, 2007, the company signed an agreement to lease 32,423 square feet of facility space in frostburg, maryland effective december 1, 2007, for use as a call center to replace the existing cumberland, maryland facility. in april 2007, the company signed a non binding letter of intent to sell the infospherix subsidiary. the sale will allow spherix to focus all of its efforts on the biospherix division s biotechnology products, with the principal focus on the commercialization of naturlose. 11
