NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





 
 
 




Note 1 -

 
The financial statements included in this report reflect all
normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the
Corporation’s consolidated financial position at June 30, 2005
and December 31, 2004, the consolidated results of operations
for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2005 and
2004 and the consolidated cash flows for the six-month periods
ended June 30, 2005 and 2004. The unaudited results of
operations for the interim periods reported are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected for the full year.


 
 
 


 

 
Certain notes and other information have been condensed or
omitted from these interim financial statements. These
statements, therefore, should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes included in
the Corporation’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2004.


 
 
 


 

 
In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47)
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which
clarifies the term “conditional asset retirement obligation”, as
used in FASB Statement 143. FIN 47 requires recognition of a
liability for legally required asset retirement obligations,
when the timing or method of settlement are conditional on a
future event, if the liability can be reasonably estimated. FIN
47 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005.
The Corporation is assessing the effect of FIN 47, but does not
expect it to have a material effect on the Corporation’s
financial position or results of operations.


 
 
 


 

 
FASB Staff Position No. FAS 19-1, Accounting for Suspended Well
Costs, was issued in April 2005 and will be effective in the
third quarter. This FASB Staff Position (FSP) addresses
circumstances that would permit the continued capitalization of
exploratory well costs beyond one year. The Corporation does
not expect that this FSP will have a material effect on its
financial position or results of operations.


 
 
 


 

 
During the first half of 2005, the Corporation expensed $108 million of capitalized
exploratory well costs ($55 million capitalized at year-end 2004) relating to two
deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells. Other than current period exploratory drilling costs,
there were no other material changes to capitalized exploratory well costs at June 30,
2005 compared with December 31, 2004.

During the first quarter of 2005, the Corporation permanently reduced LIFO inventories,
which are carried at lower costs than current inventory costs. The effect of the LIFO
inventory liquidation, before income taxes, was to decrease cost of products sold by
approximately $11 million.

Note 9 -

 
The Corporation records compensation expense for restricted common stock ratably over
the vesting period, which is generally three to five years. The Corporation uses the
intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options. Because the exercise
prices of employee stock options equal or exceed the market price of the stock on the
date of grant, the Corporation does not recognize compensation expense.


 
 
 


 

 
The Corporation uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of employee
stock options for pro forma disclosure. Using the fair value method, stock option
expense would be recognized over the one- to three-year vesting periods. The
following pro forma financial information presents the effect on net income and
earnings per share as if the Corporation used the fair value method (in millions,
except per share data):

In 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board reissued Statement No. 123, Share-Based
Payment (FAS 123R). This new standard requires that compensation expense for all
stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be
recognized in the income statement based on fair values. The Corporation must adopt
FAS 123R no later than January 1, 2006. The Corporation is evaluating the requirements
of FAS 123R and believes that if it adopted the standard in the periods shown above, the
impact would not have differed materially from the additional compensation expense
disclosed in the above table.

The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in other comprehensive
income (loss) to earnings at the time the hedged transactions are recognized. Hedging
decreased exploration and production results by $231 million ($363 million before income
taxes) in the second quarter of 2005 and $426 million ($671 million before income taxes)
in the first half of 2005. Hedging decreased exploration and production results by $124
million ($198 million before income taxes) in the second quarter of 2004 and $197 million
($316 million before income taxes) in the first half of 2004.


 
 
 


 

 
At June 30, 2005, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included after-tax
deferred losses of $1,702 million ($93 million of
realized losses and $1,609 million of unrealized losses) related to crude oil
contracts used as hedges of future exploration and production sales. Realized losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income represent losses on closed contracts that are
deferred until the underlying barrels are sold. After-tax realized losses will reduce
2005 income as follows: third quarter — $48 million and fourth quarter — $45 million.
The pre-tax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the
related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.


 
 
 


 

 
In its energy marketing business, the Corporation has entered into cash flow hedges to
fix the purchase prices of natural gas, heating oil, residual fuel oil and electricity
related to contracted future sales. At June 30, 2005, the net after-tax deferred gain in
accumulated other comprehensive income from these hedge contracts was $14 million.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition.



Overview

     The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two
segments, exploration and production (E&P) and refining and marketing (R&M). The E&P
segment explores for, produces and sells crude oil and natural gas. The R&M segment
manufactures, purchases, trades and markets refined petroleum products and other energy
products. Net income was $518 million for the first half of 2005, including $526
million from E&P activities and $161 million from R&M operations.

     Exploration and Production: Worldwide oil and gas production averaged 355,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second quarter of 2005, an increase of 1%
over the second quarter of 2004. Strong operating performance from existing assets and
new production from the JDA, Clair Field, and Russia all contributed to these results.
For 2005, our current production forecast is 350,000 to 360,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day, excluding any contribution from Libya. The Corporation continues to
believe that re-entry into the Oasis concessions will happen; however, the timing of our
return is difficult to predict.

     In March the Corporation announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in
Samara-Nafta, a company operating in the Volga-Urals region of Russia. Since then, the
Russian venture has acquired three additional licenses, increasing our investment to
approximately $200 million. Production from Russia averaged 7,000 barrels per day in
the second quarter.

     On July 19, the Corporation announced that an agreement was signed for the sale of
gas from the Phu Horm Field, located onshore Thailand. Amerada Hess is the operator with
a 35% interest. Gross production from the field is expected to average 80,000 to 100,000
mcf per day in 2007.

     Refining and Marketing: In the second quarter of 2005, the HOVENSA refinery
operated at full capacity and benefited from a strong margin environment. While the
retail marketing business posted higher same store gasoline volumes and convenience
store sales compared with last year, income was negatively impacted by lower retail
gasoline margins, resulting from the run up in wholesale prices during the quarter.

     The WilcoHess joint venture acquired 102 retail outlets in eastern North Carolina.
The acquisition, which was financed by the joint venture, with no capital contribution
by Amerada Hess, has solidified its competitive position in North Carolina, where it now
has 233 sites, and has increased the total number of Hess branded retail outlets to
1,355.

Overview (Continued)

     In
the second quarter, Hess LNG, a 50% joint venture, received approval from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to proceed with the Weaver’s Cove LNG
regasification terminal in Fall River, Massachusetts. While additional federal, state
and local permits are required, the receipt of the FERC certificate is an important
milestone.

     The Corporation’s current estimate of 2005 capital and exploratory expenditures is
$2.4 to $2.6 billion. This level of spending is up from the previous estimate of $2.1
billion and is opportunity driven. The Corporation’s investment in Russia accounts for
approximately $200 million of the increase, with the balance coming from additional
opportunities in its portfolio.

Results of Operations

     Net income for the second quarter of 2005 amounted to $299 million compared with
$288 million in the second quarter of 2004. Net income for the first half of 2005 was
$518 million compared with $569 million in the first half of 2004. See the following
page for a table of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods. The
after-tax results by major operating activity for the three- and six-month periods ended
June 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows (in millions, except per share data):

     In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are
disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax
basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings.
Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining
variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than
only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate
income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts.

     Earnings in the second quarter of 2005 include income tax benefits of $11 million,
reflecting the effect on deferred income taxes of a reduction in the income tax rate in
Denmark and a tax settlement in the United Kingdom. Second quarter 2005 results also
include a charge of $7 million ($10 million before income taxes) for premiums on bond
repurchases.

     The first half of 2005 includes a net gain of $11 million ($18 million before
income taxes) on the disposition of a mature North Sea asset. In addition, a net gain
of $11 million ($19 million before income taxes) was recorded on a legal settlement
reflecting the favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset sale. The
Corporation also recorded an income tax charge of $41 million related to the
repatriation of $1.3 billion of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004. Income in the first half of 2004 includes gains from asset sales of $34 million
and an income tax benefit of $13 million resulting from the completion of a prior year
United States income tax audit.

     After considering the items affecting exploration and production results described
above, the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily
attributable to changes in selling prices, sales volumes and operating costs and
exploration expenses, as discussed below.

     Selling prices: Higher average selling prices of crude oil and natural gas
increased exploration and production revenues by $192 million in the second quarter and
$355 million in the first half of 2005 compared with the corresponding periods of 2004.
The Corporation’s average selling prices were as follows:

     Crude oil hedges reduced exploration and production earnings by $231 million and
$426 million in the second quarter and first half of 2005 ($363 million and $671 million
before income taxes). Hedging decreased exploration and production results by $124
million ($198 million before income taxes) in the second quarter of 2004 and $197
million ($316 million before income taxes) in the first half of 2004.

     The Corporation has after-tax, deferred hedge losses of $1,702 million recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at June 30, 2005 related to crude oil
hedges. Of this amount, $1,609 million is unrealized and relates to open hedge
positions and the remaining $93 million is realized and relates to closed hedge
positions. The deferred realized loss will be recognized in earnings as the underlying
barrels are sold. In addition to the gains or losses on open hedge positions, the
deferred realized loss on closed hedge positions will reduce earnings during the
remainder of 2005 as follows: third quarter — $48 million and fourth quarter — $45
million. See Market Risk Disclosure for a summary of the Corporation’s open hedge
positions.

     Sales and production volumes: The Corporation’s oil and gas production, on a
barrel of oil equivalent basis was 355,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2005
compared with 351,000 barrels per day in the same period of 2004. Production in the
first half of 2005 was 356,000 barrels per day compared with 349,000 barrels per day in
the first half of 2004. The Corporation anticipates that its average production for the
full year of 2005 will be approximately 350,000 to 360,000 barrels per day. The

Reflects natural gas production converted based on relative energy content (six
Mcf equals one barrel).


     Increased production in the second quarter of 2005 includes new crude oil
production from the Corporation’s interest in a Russian joint venture. In addition,
there was increased crude oil production from the Llano Field in the Gulf of Mexico and
the Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea. New natural gas production began in the first
half of 2005 from Block A-18 in the joint development area of Malaysia and Thailand.
Crude oil production also commenced from the Clair Field in the United Kingdom and the
Central Azeri Field in Azerbaijan in the first half of 2005. Crude oil and natural gas
production in Europe was lower in the second quarter and first half of 2005 primarily
reflecting natural decline and maintenance. Higher sales volumes resulted in increased
revenues of approximately $20 million in the second quarter and first half of 2005,
compared with the corresponding periods of 2004.

Results of Operations (Continued)

     Operating costs and exploration expenses: Production expenses were higher in the
second quarter and first half of 2005 compared with 2004 reflecting increased production
volumes and higher maintenance and production taxes. Exploration expenses increased in
the second quarter and first half of 2005, principally reflecting increased drilling
activity compared with 2004. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were also
higher in 2005 due to increased production and higher depreciation rates. General and
administrative expenses were lower in the second quarter and first half of 2005, due to
the inclusion of costs for vacated office space in London in 2004.

     Other: After-tax foreign currency gains amounted to $8 million in the second
quarter and $15 million in the first half of 2005 compared with gains of $11 million and
$8 million in the corresponding periods of 2004. The pre-tax amounts were losses of $9
million and $5 million in the second quarter and first half of 2005 compared with a gain
of $15 million in the second quarter and $2 million in the first half of 2004. Pre-tax
amounts are recorded in non-operating income (expense).

     The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in the
first half of 2005 was 41% compared with 46% in the first half of 2004.

     The Corporation’s future exploration and production earnings may be impacted by
volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production
changes, exploration expenses and changes in tax rates.

Refining and Marketing

     Earnings from refining and marketing activities amounted to $98 million in the
second quarter of 2005 compared with $160 million in the corresponding period of 2004.
For the first half of 2005, refining and marketing operations earned $161 million
compared with $272 million in 2004. The Corporation’s downstream operations include
HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) accounted for on the equity method. Additional
refining and marketing activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port
Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy marketing and trading
operations.

     Refining: Refining earnings, which consist of the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s
results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on the note receivable from PDVSA and
other miscellaneous items, were $77 million in the second quarter and $119 million in
the first half of 2005 compared with $123 million in the second quarter and $198 million
in the first half of 2004.

     The Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income before income taxes was $108 million
($66 million after income taxes) in the second quarter of 2005 compared with income of
$97 million ($86 million after income taxes) in the second quarter of 2004. For the
first half of 2005, the Corporation’s share of HOVENSA’s income was $158 million ($97
million after income taxes) compared with $148 million ($137 million after income taxes)
in the first half of 2004. In 2005, the Corporation provided deferred income taxes at
the Virgin Islands statutory rate of 38.5% on HOVENSA’s income and

the interest income on the PDVSA note. In the first half of 2004, income taxes on
HOVENSA’s earnings were largely offset by available loss carryforwards. The fluid
catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for 30 days of planned maintenance in
the first quarter of 2005.

     Pre-tax interest on the PDVSA note amounted to $6 million in the second quarter and
$11 million in the first half of 2005 compared with $6 million and $13 million in the
corresponding periods of 2004.

     Port Reading earnings were $7 million in the second quarter and $14 million in the
first half of 2005 compared with $31 million and $45 million in the corresponding
periods of 2004. Port Reading’s refined product margins were lower in 2005 than in
2004. In addition, the Port Reading facility was shutdown for 36 days of planned
maintenance in the first quarter of 2005.

     Marketing: Marketing earnings, which consist principally of retail gasoline and
energy marketing activities, were $14 million in the second quarter and $27 million in
the first half of 2005 compared with $19 million and $42 million in the same periods of
2004. Retail gasoline operations were slightly profitable in the second quarter of 2005,
but generated a loss in the first half of 2005, reflecting weak margins. Retail
operations were profitable in the corresponding periods of 2004. Marketing expenses
were higher in the first half of 2005 compared with 2004 primarily reflecting additional
retail sites. Earnings from energy marketing activities were higher in the second
quarter and first half of 2005 compared with the corresponding periods of 2004,
reflecting improved margins. Total refined product sales volumes were 448,000 barrels
per day in the first half of 2005 and 444,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2004.

     The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy
commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own
account. The Corporation’s after-tax results from trading activities, including its share of the
earnings of the trading partnership, amounted to income of $7 million ($12 million before income
taxes) in the second quarter and $15 million

($28 million before income taxes) in the first half of 2005. Trading activities
resulted in income of $18 million ($32 million before income taxes) in the second
quarter and $32 million ($56 million before income taxes) in the first half of 2004.

     Refining and marketing earnings will likely continue to be volatile reflecting
competitive industry conditions and supply and demand factors, including the effects of
weather.

Corporate

     After-tax corporate expenses amounted to $28 million in the second quarter and $97
million in the first half of 2005 compared with $24 million and $26 million in same
periods of 2004. Results for the second quarter of 2005 include net expenses of $7
million
($10 million before income taxes) for premiums on bond repurchases. The first half of
2005 includes an income tax provision of $41 million for the repatriation of foreign
earnings to the United States under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The results
for the first half of 2004 include a non-cash income tax benefit of $13 million
resulting from the completion of a prior year United States income tax audit. Excluding
these items, the increase in Corporate expenses is primarily due to severance and other
benefit costs.

     After-tax interest expense for the full year of 2005 is anticipated to be lower
than the 2004 amount, primarily due to increased capitalized interest.

Sales and Other Operating Revenues

     Sales and other operating revenues increased by 31% in the second quarter and 20%
in the first half of 2005 compared with the corresponding periods of 2004. This
increase principally reflects increased selling prices of crude oil, natural gas and
refined products. The increase in cost of goods sold also reflects the increased costs
of refined products purchased.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Overview: Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2005 totaled $916 million, an
increase of $39 million from year-end. At June 30, 2005, the Corporation’s debt to
capitalization ratio was 41.8% compared to 40.7% at December 31, 2004. Total debt was
$3,786 million at June 30, 2005 and $3,835 million at December 31, 2004.  

     Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities
including changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $1,067 million in the
first half of 2005 compared with $832 million in the same period of 2004. In the first
half of 2005, the Corporation received a cash distribution of $112 million from HOVENSA.

     Cash Flows from Financing Activities: The Corporation reduced debt by $49 million
during the first half of 2005. Debt reduction in the first half of 2004 was $52
million. Dividends paid were approximately $107 million in the first half of 2005 and
$106 million in the first half of 2004. During both the first half of 2005 and 2004,
the Corporation received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $52 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)

     Future Capital Requirements and Resources: Capital and exploratory expenditures
for 2005 are currently estimated to be approximately $2.4 to 2.6 billion. The
Corporation anticipates that available cash and cash flow from operations will fund
these expenditures; however, revolving credit facilities are available, if necessary.

     With higher crude oil prices, the Corporation’s collateral requirements under
certain contracts with hedging and trading counterparties have increased. Outstanding
letters of credit were $2,892 million at June 30, 2005, including $336 million drawn
against the Corporation’s revolving credit facility, $1,425 million under committed
short-term letter of credit facilities entered into in the first half of 2005, and the
remainder under uncommitted lines. Outstanding letters of credit were $1,487 million at
December 31, 2004. At June 30, 2005, the Corporation has $2,060 million available under
its $2.5 billion syndicated revolving credit agreement and has additional unused lines
of credit of $95 million, primarily for letters of credit, under uncommitted
arrangements with banks. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it
may issue $825 million of additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or
preferred stock.

     Loan agreement covenants allow the Corporation to borrow an additional $5 billion
for the construction or acquisition of assets at June 30, 2005. The maximum amount of
dividends that can be paid from borrowings under the loan agreements is $1.9 billion at
June 30, 2005.

     Libya: Prior to June 30, 1986, the Corporation had extensive exploration and
production operations in Libya; however, U.S. Government sanctions required suspension
of participation in these operations. The Corporation wrote off the book value of its
Libyan assets in connection with the cessation of operations. During 2004, the
Corporation received U.S. Government authorization to negotiate and execute an agreement
with the government of Libya that would define the terms for resuming active
participation in the Libyan properties. The U.S. Government has lifted most of the
sanctions imposed on Libya and has rescinded the Libya portions of the Iran-Libya
Sanction Act of 1976. As a result, the Corporation and its partners will be able to
resume operations in Libya if they are able to reach a successful conclusion to
commercial negotiations. If these negotiations are successful, management anticipates
capital expenditures will increase over the current plan.

     Repatriation Provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004: The American
Jobs Creation Act (the Act) provides for a one-time reduction in the income tax rate to
5.25% on eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a U.S. parent. In March 2005,
the Corporation’s Board of Directors approved a plan to repatriate $1.3 billion of
unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, the Corporation recorded a tax provision of
$41 million in the first quarter of 2005. In August 2005, the Corporation’s Board of
Directors approved an additional repatriation plan in the amount of $600 million, which
will result in an income tax provision of $32 million in the third quarter.

     Credit Ratings: Two credit rating agencies have rated the Corporation’s debt as
investment grade; one agency’s rating is below investment grade. If another rating
agency were to reduce its credit rating below investment grade, the Corporation would
have to comply with a more stringent financial covenant contained in its revolving
credit facility. In addition, margin requirements with hedging and trading
counterparties at June 30, 2005 would increase by an immaterial amount.

     Other: In connection with the sale of six vessels in 2002, the Corporation agreed
to support the buyer’s charter rate on these vessels for up to five years. The support
agreement requires that if the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is
less than the stipulated support rate in the agreement, the Corporation will pay to the
buyer the difference between the contracted rate and the stipulated rate. The balance in
the charter support reserve at January 1 and June 30, 2005 was approximately $10
million.

     At January 1, 2005, the Corporation had an accrual of $39 million for vacated
office costs in London. During the first six months of 2005, $2 million of payments
were made reducing the accrual to $37 million at June 30, 2005. Additional accruals
totaling $21 million, before income taxes, are anticipated in the first half of 2006 for
office space to be vacated.

     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Corporation has leveraged leases not included
in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation
operates. The net present value of these leases is $474 million at June 30, 2005. The
Corporation’s June 30, 2005 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 41.8% to
44.7% if the leases were included as debt.

     The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSA’s crude oil
purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA. At June 30, 2005, the guarantee amounted to
$162 million. This amount fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and
related crude oil prices. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up
to a maximum of $40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior
debt obligations.

Market Risk Disclosure

     In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks
related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and
electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In
the disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as non-trading activities.
The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest
in a trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks
primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products.

Market Risk Disclosure (Continued)

     Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign
exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity linked
securities in its non-trading and trading activities. These contracts are widely traded
instruments mainly with standardized terms. In some cases, physical purchase and sale
contracts are used as trading instruments and are included in the trading results.

     Quantitative Measures: The Corporation uses value-at-risk to monitor and control
commodity risk within its trading activities. The value-at-risk model uses historical
simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a
95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for
options. The potential change in fair value based on commodity price risk is presented
in the non-trading and trading sections below.

     Non-Trading: The Corporation’s exploration and production segment uses futures and
swaps to fix the selling prices of a portion of its future production and the related
gains or losses are an integral part of its selling prices. As of June 30, the
Corporation has not hedged any of its future natural gas production. Following is a
summary of the crude oil hedges as of June 30, 2005:

     Because the selling price of crude oil has increased significantly since the hedges
were acquired, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at June 30, 2005 includes
after-tax deferred losses of $1,702 million related to crude oil contracts used as
hedges of exploration and production sales. As market conditions change, the
Corporation may adjust its hedge percentages.

     The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum
products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses futures and swaps to fix
the purchase prices of commodities to be sold under fixed-price sales contracts.

     The Corporation estimates that at June 30, 2005, the value-at-risk for commodity
related derivatives that are settled in cash and used in non-trading activities was $127
million ($108 million at December 31, 2004). The results may vary from time to time as
hedge levels change.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings





 
 
 




 

 
As disclosed in Registrant’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004
(the Form 10-K), purported class actions consolidated under a complaint captioned: In re Amerada Hess Securities Litigation were pending in United States District Court
for the District of New Jersey against Registrant and certain executive officers and
former executive officers of the Registrant alleging that these individuals sold
shares of the Registrant’s common stock in advance of the Registrant’s acquisition
of Triton Energy Limited (“Triton”) in 2001 in violation of federal securities laws.
In April 2003, the Registrant and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss for
failure to state a claim and failure to plead fraud with particularity. On March 31,
2004, the court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint. The
plaintiffs were granted leave to file an amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed an
amended complaint in June 2004. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.
In June 2005, this motion was denied. Defendants believe this action is without
merit and will continue to defend this action vigorously.


 
 
 


 

 
As reported in Registrant’s Form 10-K, the Registrant, along with other companies
engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits and claims
related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of
substantially identical lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental
entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the United States against producers of
MTBE and petroleum refiners who produce gasoline containing MTBE, including
Registrant. These cases have been consolidated in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York. The principal allegation is that gasoline
containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in
proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damages to groundwater resources
and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effect on the
environment of releases of MTBE. In some cases, punitive damages are also sought.
Additional property damage of personal injury lawsuits and claims related to the use
of MTBE are expected. Prior class action product liability based litigation involving
MTBE in gasoline has been resolved without a material effect on the Registrant. While
the damages claimed in these actions are substantial, these actions are in their
preliminary phases of discovery and only limited information is available to evaluate
the factual merits of those claims. In April 2005, the District Court denied the
primary legal aspects of defendants’ motion to dismiss these actions. Registrant
believes that significant legal uncertainty remains regarding the validity of causes
of action asserted by plaintiffs. Accordingly, there is insufficient information on
which to evaluate the Registrant’s exposure in these cases.


 
 
 


 

 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has notified the Registrant that on
July 21, 2005, it commenced a private investigation into payments made to the
government of Equatorial Guinea or to officials and persons affiliated with officials
of the government of Equatorial Guinea. The staff of the SEC has requested documents
and information from the Registrant and other oil and gas companies that have
operations or interests in Equatorial Guinea. The staff of the SEC had previously
been conducting an informal inquiry into such matters. The Registrant has been
cooperating and continues to cooperate with the SEC investigation.
