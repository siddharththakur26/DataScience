NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Allis-Chalmers”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a
multi-faceted oilfield service company that provides services and equipment to oil and natural gas
exploration and production companies, throughout the United States including Texas, Louisiana, New
Mexico, Colorado, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Wyoming, Arkansas, West Virginia, offshore in the Gulf of
Mexico, and internationally, primarily in Argentina and Mexico. We operate in six sectors of the
oil and natural gas service industry: Rental Services; International Drilling; Directional
Drilling; Tubular Services; Underbalanced Drilling; and Production Services.

We derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and
equipment required to provide a service and rates per day for equipment and tools that we rent to
our customers. The price we charge for our services depends upon several factors, including the
level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular
geographic regions in which we operate. Contracts are awarded based on price, quality of service
and equipment and general reputation and experience of our personnel. The principal operating
costs are direct and indirect labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment,
insurance, equipment rentals, fuel, depreciation and general and administrative expenses.

On October 25, 2006 our Board of Directors approved the transfer of the listing of our common stock
from the American Stock Exchange (“AMEX”) to the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Our common
stock continued to trade on the AMEX under the symbol “ALY” until the transfer was completed on
March 22, 2007, at which time we began trading on the NYSE under the symbol “ALY”.

Basis of Presentation

Our unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.
Accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. We
believe that the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate to make the information not
misleading. The unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the interim
periods. These unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2006. The results of operations for the interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year.

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year’s consolidated condensed financial
statements to conform with the current period presentation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty.
Accordingly, our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. While management believes
that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements
are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but are
not limited to, determining the following: allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of
long-lived assets and intangibles, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes
and valuation allowances. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional
information is obtained and as our operating environment changes.

NOTE 1 — NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance
with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. It prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1,
2007 and such adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Our policy is that we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as
a component of income tax expense. As of the date of adoption of FIN 48, we did not have any
accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits. For United States
federal tax purposes, our tax returns for the tax years 2001 through 2006 remain open for
examination by the tax authorities. Our foreign tax returns remain open for examination for the
tax years 2001 through 2006. Generally, for state tax purposes, our 2002 through 2006 tax years
remain open for examination by the tax authorities under a four year statute of limitations,
however, certain states may keep their statute open for six to ten years.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”), which is
intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements by defining fair
value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 157
and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities (“SFAS 159”), which permits entities to elect to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value.  Upon adoption of SFAS 159, an entity may elect
the fair value option for eligible items that exist at the adoption date. Subsequent to the initial
adoption, the election of the fair value option should only be made at the initial recognition of
the asset or liability or upon a re-measurement event that gives rise to the new-basis of
accounting. All subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument are reported in earnings. 
SFAS No. 159 does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and
liabilities to be recorded at fair value nor does it eliminate disclosure requirements included in
other accounting standards.  SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity’s
first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007.  We are currently evaluating the provisions
of SFAS 159 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.

NOTE 2
— ACQUISITIONS

In June 2007, we acquired Coker Directional, Inc., or Coker, for a purchase price of approximately
$3.5 million in cash and a promissory note for $350,000. Coker operated in the Gulf Coast and
Central Texas regions and will be included in our Directional Drilling segment.

In July 2007, we acquired Diggar Tools, LLC, or Diggar, for a purchase price of approximately $9.6
million in cash and a promissory note for $750,000. Diggar operated in the Rocky Mountains and
owned 115 downhole motors and will be included in our Directional Drilling segment.

NOTE 3
— SALE OF CAPILLARY ASSETS

On June 29, 2007, we sold our capillary tubing units and related equipment for approximately $16.3
million. We reported a gain of approximately $8.9 million. The assets sold represented a small
portion of our Production Services segment. Our Production Services segment will continue to
provide a variety of production-related rental tools, equipment and services.

NOTE 4
— STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

We adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. Compensation cost for awards
granted prior to, but not vested, as of January 1, 2006 would be based on the grant date attributes
originally used to value those awards for pro forma purposes under SFAS No. 123. We adopted
SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option
pricing model for the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options. Under the
modified prospective method, we record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of
December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the
remaining vesting periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings. We
estimated forfeiture rates for the first nine months of 2007 and 2006 based on our historical
experience

The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free rate
of interest is the related U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods within the expected term of the
option at the time of grant. The dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero as we
have historically not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future. The
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock.

Our net income for the three months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 includes approximately $1.0
million and $860,000, respectively of compensation costs related to share-based payments. Our net
income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 includes approximately $2.1 million
and $2.6 million, respectively of compensation costs related to share-based payments. As of
September 30, 2007 there is $2.8 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested
stock option grants. We expect to recognize approximately $364,000 over the remainder of 2007,
approximately $939,000, $918,000 and $532,000 to be recognized during the years ended 2008, 2009
and 2010, respectively.

would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on
September 30, 2007. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2007 was $362,000 and $6.5 million, respectively. The total cash

NOTE 4
— STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued)

For options granted since June 2007, we decreased the expected option life to 5 years from 7 years
to reflect recent option exercise experience.

We determine the fair value of RSAs based on the market price of our common stock on the date of
grant. Compensation cost for RSAs is primarily recognized on a straight-line basis over the
vesting or service period and is net of forfeitures. The total fair value of shares vested during
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $485,000. As of September 30, 2007, there
was approximately $13.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSAs.
We expect approximately $2.1 million to be recognized over the remainder of 2007, approximately
$5.6 million, $4.5 million and $1.2 million to be recognized during the years ended 2008, 2009 and
2010, respectively.

NOTE 5
— INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

We compute income per common share in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per
Share. SFAS No. 128 requires companies with complex capital structures to present basic and
diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share are computed on the basis of the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share
is similar to basic earnings per share, but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of
potential common shares (e.g., convertible preferred stock, stock options, etc.) as if they had
been converted. Potential dilutive common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (e.g., those
that increase income per share) are excluded from diluted earnings per share.

The components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows (in thousands, except per
share amounts):

NOTE 6
— GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets are not permitted to be amortized. Goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets remain on the balance sheet and are tested for impairment on an
annual basis, or when there is reason to suspect that their values may have been diminished or
impaired. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets listed on the balance sheet totaled
$130.3 million and $125.8 million at September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.  Based
on impairment testing performed during 2006 pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 142, these
assets were not impaired.

Intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. 
Definite-lived intangible assets that continue to be amortized under SFAS No. 142 relate to our
purchase of customer-related and marketing-related intangibles. These intangibles have useful
lives ranging from five to ten years. Amortization of intangible assets for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2007 were $989,000 and $3.0 million, respectively, compared to $399,000
and $1.2 million, respectively for the same periods in the prior year.  At September 30, 2007,
intangible assets totaled $30.9 million, net of $5.3 million of accumulated amortization.

NOTE 8
— DEBT (continued)

Senior notes, bank loans and line of credit agreements

On January 18, 2006 and August 14, 2006, we closed on private offerings, to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, of $160.0 and $95.0 million
aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, respectively. The senior notes are due January 15,
2014 and bear interest at 9.0%. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisitions of Specialty
Rental Tools, Inc., or Specialty, and DLS Drilling, Logistics & Services Corporation, or DLS, to
repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes.

On January 18, 2006, we also executed an amended and restated credit agreement which provided for a
$25.0 million revolving line of credit with a maturity of January 2010. Our January 2006 amended
and restated credit agreement contained customary events of default and financial covenants and
limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay dividends or
make other distributions, create liens and sell assets. Our obligations under the January 2006
amended and restated credit agreement were secured by substantially all of our assets located in
the United States.

On December 18, 2006, we closed on a $300.0 million senior unsecured bridge loan. The bridge loan
was due 18 months after closing and bore a weighted average interest rate of 10.6%. The bridge
loan, which was repaid on January 29, 2007, was used to fund the acquisition of substantially all
of the assets of Oil & Gas Rental Services, Inc., or OGR.

In January 2007, we closed on a private offering, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, of $250.0 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due
2017. The proceeds of the senior notes offering, together with a portion of the proceeds of our
concurrent common stock offering, were used to repay the debt outstanding under our $300.0 million
bridge loan facility which we incurred to finance our acquisition of substantially all the assets
of OGR.

On April 26, 2007, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which increased
our revolving line of credit to $62.0 million, and has a final maturity date of April 26, 2012.
The amended and restated credit agreement contains customary events of default and financial
covenants and limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay
dividends or make other distributions, create liens and sell assets. Our obligations under the
amended and restated credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets located in the
United States.

As part of our acquisition of DLS, we assumed various bank loans with floating interest rates based
on LIBOR plus a margin and terms ranging from 2 to 5 years. The weighted average interest rates
were 6.72% and 7.0% at September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The bank loans are
denominated in U.S. dollars and the outstanding amounts due as of September 30, 2007 and December
31, 2006 were $5.5 million and $7.3 million, respectively.

Notes payable

As part of the acquisition of Mountain Compressed Air Inc., or Mountain Air, in 2001, we issued a
note to the sellers of Mountain Air in the original amount of $2.2 million accruing interest at a
rate of 5.75% per annum. The note was reduced to $1.5 million as a result of the settlement of a
legal action against the sellers in 2003. At September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 the
outstanding amounts due were $0 and $150,000, respectively.

In connection with the acquisition of Rogers Oil Tool Services, Inc., or Rogers, we issued to the
seller a note in the amount of $750,000. The note bears interest at 5.0% and is due April 3, 2009.
In connection with the acquisition of Coker we issued to the seller a note in the amount of
$350,000. The note bears interest at 8.25% and is due June 29, 2008. In connection with the
acquisition of Diggar we issued to the seller a note in the amount of $750,000. The note bears
interest at 6.0% and is due July 26, 2008.

In connection with the purchase of Safco-Oil Field Products, Inc., or Safco, we also agreed to pay
a total of $150,000 to the sellers in exchange for a non-compete agreement. We are required to
make annual payments of $50,000 through September 30, 2007. In connection with the purchase of
Capcoil Tubing Services, Inc., or Capcoil, we agreed to pay a total of $500,000 to two management
employees in exchange for non-compete agreements. We are required to make annual payments of
$110,000 through May 2008. Total amounts due under these non-compete agreements at September 30,
2007 and December 31, 2006 were $160,000 and $270,000, respectively.

In 2000 we compensated directors, including current directors Nederlander and Toboroff, who served
on the board of directors from 1989 to March 31, 1999 without compensation, by issuing promissory
notes totaling $325,000. The notes bore interest at the rate of 5.0%. At September 30, 2007 and
December 31, 2006, the principal and accrued interest on these notes totaled approximately $32,000.

Other debt

We have various equipment and vehicle financing loans with interest rates ranging from 7.85% to
8.7% and terms of 2 to 3 years. As of September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the outstanding
balances for equipment and vehicle financing loans were $942,000 and $3.5 million, respectively.
In April 2006 and August 2006, we obtained insurance premium financings in the amount of $1.9
million and $896,000 with fixed interest rates of 5.6% and 6.0%, respectively. Under terms of the
agreements, amounts outstanding are paid over 10 month and 11 month repayment schedules. In April
2007, we renewed the insurance premium financing in an amount of $3.2 million with a fixed interest
rate of 5.9% and a repayment schedule of 11 months. The outstanding balance of these notes was
approximately $2.9 million and $1.0 million as of September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006,
respectively. We also have various capital leases with terms that expire in 2008. As of September
30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, amounts outstanding under capital leases were $42,000 and $414,000,
respectively.

NOTE 9 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

In January 2007 we closed on a public offering of 6.0 million shares of our common stock at a
public offering price of $17.65 per share. Net proceeds from the public offering, together with
the proceeds of our concurrent senior notes offering, were used to repay the debt outstanding under
our $300.0 million bridge loan facility, which we incurred to finance the OGR acquisition and for
general corporate purposes.

We also had options and warrants exercised in the first nine months of 2007, which resulted in
579,255 shares of our common stock being issued for approximately $3.2 million. We recognized
approximately $2.1 million of compensation expense related to share based payments in the first
nine months of 2007 that was recorded as capital in excess of par value (see Note 4). We also
recorded approximately $1.6 million of tax benefit related to our stock compensation plans.

NOTE

NOTE 13 — LEGAL MATTERS

We are named from time to time in legal proceedings related to our activities prior to our
bankruptcy in 1988. However, we believe that we were discharged from liability for all such claims
in the bankruptcy and believe the likelihood of a material loss relating to any such legal
proceeding is remote.

We are also involved in various other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The
legal proceedings are at different stages; however, we believe that the likelihood of material loss
relating to any such legal proceeding is remote.

NOTE 14 — SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On October 23, 2007, we purchased all of the issued and outstanding stock of Rebel Rentals, Inc.,
or Rebel Rentals, for an aggregate purchase price of $6.75 million. The acquisition of Rebel
Rentals adds additional equipment and support to our casing and tubing operations in our Tubular
Services segment.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATION

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This report contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ
materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause
such differences include, but are not limited to, the general condition of the oil and natural gas
drilling industry, demand for our oil and natural gas service and rental products, and competition.
For more information on forward-looking statements please refer to the section
entitled“Forward-Looking Statements” on page 30.

Overview of Our Business

We are a multi-faceted oilfield services company that provides services and equipment to oil and
natural gas exploration and production companies, throughout domestically primarily in Texas,
Louisiana, New Mexico, Colorado, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Wyoming, Arkansas, West Virginia, offshore
in the Gulf of Mexico and internationally primarily in Argentina and Mexico. We currently operate
in six sectors of the oil and natural gas service industry: Rental Services; International
Drilling; Directional Drilling; Tubular Services; Underbalanced Drilling; and Production Services.

We derive operating revenues from rates per day and rates per job that we charge for the labor and
equipment required to provide a service and rates per day for equipment and tools that we rent to
our customers. The price we charge for our services depends upon several factors, including the
level of oil and natural gas drilling activity and the competitive environment in the particular
geographic regions in which we operate. Contracts are awarded based on price, quality of service
and equipment, and the general reputation and experience of our personnel. The demand for drilling
services has historically been volatile and is affected by the capital expenditures of oil and
natural gas exploration and development companies, which can fluctuate based upon the prices of oil
and natural gas, or the expectation for the prices of oil and natural gas.

The number of working drilling rigs, typically referred to as the “rig count,” is an important
indicator of activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry. The rig count in the United
States increased from 862 as of December 31, 2002 to 1,760 on October 26, 2007 according to the
Baker Hughes rig count. Furthermore, directional and horizontal rig counts increased from 283 as
of December 31, 2002 to 767 on October 26, 2007, which accounted for 32.8% and 43.6% of the total
U.S. rig count, respectively. However, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico rig count has decreased to 51 as of
October 26, 2007 from 87 one year ago.

Our cost of revenues represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and
maintenance of our equipment. The principal elements of these costs are direct and indirect labor
and benefits, repairs and maintenance of our equipment, insurance, equipment rentals, fuel and
depreciation. Operating expenses do not fluctuate in direct proportion to changes in revenues
because, among other factors, we have a fixed base of inventory of equipment and facilities to
support our operations, and in periods of low drilling activity we may also seek to preserve labor
continuity to market our services and maintain our equipment.

Cyclical Nature of Equipment Rental and Services Industry

 
The oilfield services industry is highly cyclical. The most critical factor in assessing the
outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and
demand for natural gas. The peaks and valleys of demand are further apart than those of many other
cyclical industries. This is primarily a result of the industry being driven by commodity demand
and corresponding price increases. As demand increases, producers raise their prices. The price
escalation enables producers to increase their capital expenditures. The increased capital
expenditures ultimately result in greater revenues and profits for services and equipment
companies. The increased capital expenditures also ultimately result in greater production which
historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices.
 

Demand for our services has been strong for approximately the past three years beginning in 2004,
due to high oil and natural gas prices and increased demand and declining production costs for
natural gas as compared to other energy sources. Management believes the current market
fundamentals are indicative of a favorable long-term trend of activity in our markets. However,
these factors could be more than offset by other developments affecting the worldwide supply and
demand for oil and natural gas products. The price for natural gas in the U.S. can have a
significant impact on the capital expenditures of our customers operating in the U.S. domestic
market. Natural gas prices can be affected by such factors as the U.S. economy, new production or
pipeline capacity and weather.

Results of Operations

In April 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Rogers Oil Tool Services, Inc., or
Rogers. We report the operations of Rogers in our Tubular Services segment. In August 2006, we
acquired all of the outstanding stock of DLS Drilling, Logistics & Services Corporation, or DLS,
and in December 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Tanus Argentina S.A., or Tanus.
We report the operations of DLS and Tanus in our International Drilling segment. In October 2006,
we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Petro-Rentals, Incorporated, or Petro Rentals. We
report the operations of Petro Rentals in our Production Services segment. In December 2006, we
acquired substantially all of the assets of Oil & Gas Rental Services, Inc., or OGR. We report the
operations of OGR in our Rental Services segment. In June of 2007, we acquired all of the
outstanding stock of Coker Directional, Inc., or Coker. In July of 2007, we acquired all of the
outstanding stock of Diggar Tools, LLC, or Diggar. We report the operations of Coker and Diggar in
our Directional Drilling segment. We consolidated the results of these acquisitions from the day
they were acquired.

The foregoing acquisitions affect the comparability from period to period of our historical
results, and our historical results may not be indicative of our future results.

Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2007 and 2006

Our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2007 were $147.9 million, an increase of
70.4% compared to $86.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006. Revenues increased
in all of our business segments, except for Tubular Services, due to acquisitions completed in
2006, the investment in new capital equipment, improved pricing and the opening of new operating
locations. The most significant increase in revenues was due to the acquisition of DLS on August
14, 2006 which expanded our operations to a sixth operating segment, International Drilling.
Revenues also increased significantly at our Rental Services segment due to the OGR asset
acquisition on December 18, 2006. Our Directional Drilling segment revenues increased in the 2007
period compared to the 2006 period due to improved pricing for directional drilling, the purchase
of additional downhole motors and measurement-while-drilling, or MWD, tools and the addition of
directional drilling personnel. Revenues for our Production Services segment increased due to the
acquisition of Petro Rentals on October 17, 2006 and the addition of two coil tubing units in the
fourth quarter of 2006 and one additional unit in the first quarter of 2007. Revenues increased at
our Underbalanced Drilling segment due to the purchase of additional equipment, principally new
compressor packages.

Our gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 increased 58.3% to $45.6 million, or
30.8% of revenues, compared to $28.8 million, or 33.2%, of revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2006. The increase in gross margin is due to the increase in revenues in five of our
business segments. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to the acquisition of the OGR
assets on December 18, 2006 and the acquisition of DLS on August 14, 2006. Also, contributing to
our gross margin was the purchase of additional MWD tools and downhole motors, the addition of
directional drilling personnel, the acquisition of Petro Rentals, and the addition of two coil
tubing units in the fourth quarter of 2006 and one additional unit in the first quarter of 2007.
The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the lower gross margin
percentage that DLS achieves in the International Drilling segment partly offset by the acquisition
of the OGR assets in the high margin rental services business. Also contributing to the decrease
in our gross margin percentage was the increase in downhole motor rental and repairs and increased
personnel expenses in our Directional Drilling segment, a more competitive pricing environment in
our domestic Tubular Services segment and decreased sales of power tongs. The increase in gross
margin was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of 141.7% to $13.2 million for
the third quarter of 2007 compared to $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2006. The increase is
due to additional depreciable assets resulting from the acquisitions and capital expenditures. Our
cost of revenues consists principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals,
maintenance and repairs of our equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. Because many of our
costs are fixed, our gross profit as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of
revenues.

General and administrative expense was $13.5 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $9.1
million for the third quarter of 2006. General and administrative expense increased due to the
additional expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the hiring of additional sales and
administrative personnel. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses were
9.1% in the third quarter of 2007 compared to 10.4% in the third quarter of 2006.

We adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. We adopted SFAS No. 123R using
the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model for
the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options and restricted stock. Therefore,
we recorded an expense of $1.0 million and $860,000 related to stock options and restricted stock
for the three months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The amount of option and
restricted stock expense recorded in general and administrative expense was $1.0 million for the
third quarter of 2007 and $727,000 for the third quarter of 2006 with the balance being recorded as
a direct cost.

Amortization expense was $989,000 in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $399,000 in the third
quarter of 2006. The increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of intangible
assets obtained in connection with our acquisitions.

Income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2007 totaled $31.1 million, a 61.1%
increase over income from operations of $19.3 million for the three months ended September 30,
2006, reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross margin, offset in part by increased general
and administrative expenses and amortization. Our income from operations as a percentage of
revenues decreased to 21.1% for the third quarter of 2007 from 22.3% for the third quarter of 2006,
due principally to the decrease in our gross margin as a percentage of revenues.

Our interest expense was $11.8 million in the third quarter of 2007, compared to $5.3 million for
the third quarter of 2006. Interest expense increased in the third quarter of 2007 due to our
increased debt. In August 2006 we issued an additional $95.0 million of senior notes bearing
interest at 9.0% to fund a portion of the acquisition of DLS. In January 2007 we issued $250.0
million of senior notes bearing interest at 8.5% to pay off, in part, the bridge loan utilized to
complete the OGR acquisition and for working capital. Interest expense includes amortization
expense of deferred financing costs of $506,000 and $282,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively.

Our provision for income taxes for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 was $7.2 million, or 35.8%
of our net income before income taxes, compared to $3.1 million, or 21.7% of our net income before
income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2006. The increase in income taxes is
attributable to our higher operating income and a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax
rate in the 2006 period was favorably impacted by the reversal of the valuation allowance on our
deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was reversed due to operating results that allowed
for the realization of our deferred tax assets. As of January 1, 2007, no valuation allowance
remained and had no impact on the 2007 effective tax rate.

We had net income of $13.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007, an increase of
15.4%, compared to net income of $11.3 million for the third quarter of 2006.

The following table compares revenues and income from operations for each of our business segments
and loss of income for general corporate purposes. Income (loss) from operations consists of
revenues less cost of revenues, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and
amortization:

Rental Services Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 for the Rental Services segment were $28.9
million, an increase from $13.2 million in revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2006.
Income from operations increased to $12.5 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $6.6
million in the third quarter of 2006. Our Rental Services segment revenues and operating income
for the third quarter of 2007 increased compared to the prior year due primarily to the OGR
acquisition on December 18, 2006. Income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to
43.3% for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 compared to 49.8% for the quarter ended September
30, 2006 as a result of higher depreciation expense associated with OGR acquisition and capital
expenditures. The increase in revenues and operating income which resulted from the OGR
acquisition was partially offset by the impact of decreased U.S. Gulf of Mexico drilling activity
in the third quarter of 2007 compared to the previous year, including the impact of hurricanes
during the quarter.

International Drilling Segment

On August 14, 2006, we acquired DLS which established our International Drilling segment. Revenues
for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 for the International Drilling segment were $58.5 million,
an increase from $23.9 million in revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. Income from
operations increased to $10.3 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $4.1 million in the
third quarter of 2006.

Directional Drilling Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 for our Directional Drilling segment were $27.6
million, an increase of 37.8% from the $20.0 million in revenues for the quarter ended September
30, 2006. Income from operations increased 16.4% to $6.0 million for the third quarter of 2007
from $5.1 million for the comparable 2006 period. The increase in revenues and operating income is
due to the purchase of additional MWD tools and downhole motors and the addition of directional
drillers. Operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 21.6% for the third quarter of
2007 compared to 25.6% for the prior year period due to increased expenses for downhole motor
rentals and repairs along with increased personnel costs.

Tubular Services Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 for the Tubular Services segment were $12.6
million, a decrease of 8.6% from the $13.8 million in revenues for the quarter ended September 30,
2006. Revenues from domestic operations decreased to $10.4 million in the third quarter of 2007
from $12.3 million in the third quarter of 2006. Revenues from operations in Mexico were $2.2
million for the third quarter of 2007 compared to $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2006.
Income from operations decreased 38.1% to $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2007 from $3.7
million in the third quarter of 2006. The decrease in this segment’s revenues and operating income
was due to an increased competitive pricing environment domestically for casing and tubing
services, and decreased sales of power tongs in the third quarter of 2007 compared to the third
quarter of 2006.

Underbalanced Drilling Segment

Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 for the Underbalanced Drilling segment were $12.9
million, an increase of 7.7% compared to $12.0 million in revenues for the quarter ended September
30, 2006. Income from operations decreased to $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared
to income from operations of $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2006. Revenues and operating
income in our Underbalanced Drilling segment were affected by a decrease in drilling activity in
certain geographic areas by some of our customers, partially offset by an increased market presence
and growth in drilling activity in other geographic areas and the benefits of our investment in
additional equipment.

Production Services Segment

Revenues were $7.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 for the Production Services
segment, an increase of 86.1% compared to $4.0 million in revenues for the quarter ended September
30, 2006. Income from operations increased to $402,000 in the third quarter of 2007 compared to
$119,000 in the third quarter of 2006. Our Production Services segment revenues and operating
income for the third quarter of 2007 increased compared to the third quarter of 2006 due primarily
to our acquisition of Petro Rentals on October 17, 2006, the addition of two coil tubing units in
the fourth quarter of 2006 and one additional unit in the first quarter of 2007, offset in part by
the sale of our capillary tubing assets in June 2007, and an increase in personnel and training
expenses for the crews in anticipation of the delivery and activation of new coil tubing units
which were delayed in being delivered.

General Corporate

General corporate expenses decreased $117,000 to $3.4 million for the quarter ended September 30,
2007 compared to $3.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. The decrease was due to
reduced consulting fees in connection with our Sarbanes Oxley compliance efforts and reduced
expenses for stock options.

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2007 and 2006

Our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 were $427.1 million, an increase of
117.9% compared to $196.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. Revenues increased
in all of our business segments due to acquisitions completed in 2006, the investment in new
capital equipment, improved pricing and the opening of new operating locations. The most
significant increase in revenues was due to the acquisition of DLS on August 14, 2006, which
expanded our operations to a sixth operating segment, International Drilling. Revenues also
increased significantly at our Rental Services segment due to the OGR asset acquisition on
December 18, 2006. Revenues for our Production Services segment increased due to the acquisition
of Petro Rentals on October 17, 2006 and the addition of two coil tubing units in the fourth
quarter of 2006 and one in the first quarter of 2007. Our Directional Drilling segment revenues
increased in the 2007 period compared to the 2006 period due to improved pricing for directional
drilling and the purchase of additional downhole motors and MWD tools which increased our capacity
and market presence. Our Tubular Services segment also had an increase in revenue, primarily due
to the acquisition of Rogers as of April 3, 2006 and the purchase of additional equipment.
Revenues increased at our Underbalanced Drilling segment due to the purchase of additional
equipment, principally new compressor packages.

Our gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 increased 99.9% to $140.0 million, or
32.8% of revenues, compared to $70.1 million, or 35.7% of revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2006. The increase in gross margin is due to the increase in revenues in all of our
business segments, but primarily due to the acquisition of the OGR assets on December 18, 2006 and
the acquisition of DLS on August 14, 2006. Also, contributing to our gross margin was the purchase
of additional MWD tools and downhole motors, the acquisition of Rogers and Petro Rentals, and the
addition of two coil tubing units in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease in gross margin as a
percentage of revenues is primarily due to the lower gross margin percentage that DLS achieves in
the International Drilling segment partly offset by the acquisition of the OGR assets in the high
margin rental services business and the improved pricing for our services generally. Also
contributing to the decrease in our gross margin percentage was the increase in downhole motor
rental and repairs and increased personnel expenses in our Directional Drilling segment, a more
competitive pricing environment in our domestic Tubular Services segment and decreased sales of
power tongs. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by an increase in depreciation
expense of 195.4% to $37.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared to $12.6
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The increase is due to additional
depreciable assets resulting from the acquisitions and capital expenditures. Our cost of revenues
consists principally of our labor costs and benefits, equipment rentals, maintenance and repairs of
our equipment, depreciation, insurance and fuel. Because many of our costs are fixed, our gross
margin as a percentage of revenues is generally affected by our level of revenues.

General and administrative expense was $41.7 million in the first nine months of 2007 compared to
$24.5 million for the first nine months of 2006. General and administrative expense increased due
to the additional expenses associated with the acquisitions, and the hiring of additional sales and
administrative personnel. General and administrative expense also increased because of increased
corporate accounting and administrative staff. As a percentage of revenues, general and
administrative expenses were 9.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared to 12.5% in
the same period of 2006.

We adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006. This statement requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. We adopted SFAS No. 123R using
the modified prospective transition method, utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model for
the calculation of the fair value of our employee stock options and restricted stock. Therefore,
we recorded an expense of $2.1 million and $2.6 million related to stock options and restricted
stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The amount of option
and restricted stock expense recorded in general and administrative expense was $2.0 million for
the first nine months of 2007 and $2.3 million for the first nine months of 2006 with the balance
being recorded as a direct cost.

On June 29, 2007, we sold our capillary tubing assets that were part of our Production Services
segment. The total sale agreement was $16.3 million in cash. We recognized a gain of $8.9 million
related to the sale of these assets.

Amortization expense was $3.0 million in the first nine months of 2007 compared to $1.2 million in
the first nine months of 2006. The increase in amortization expense is due to the amortization of
intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions.

Table of Contents

Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 totaled $104.1 million, a
135.0% increase over income from operations of $44.3 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2006, reflecting the increase in our revenues and gross margin, the gain from the sale of
assets, offset in part by increased general and administrative expenses and amortization. Our
income from operations as a percentage of revenues increased to 24.4% for the first nine months of
2007 from 22.6% for the first nine months of 2006, due principally to the decrease in general,
administrative and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenue and the gain from the sale of
assets.

Our interest expense was $37.7 million in the first nine months of 2007, compared to $13.3 million
for the first nine months of 2006. Interest expense increased in the first nine months of 2007,
compared to the first nine months of 2006, due to our increased debt. In August 2006 we issued an
additional $95.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at 9.0% to fund a portion of the
acquisition of DLS. In January 2007 we issued $250.0 million of senior notes bearing interest at
8.5% to pay off, in part, the bridge loan utilized to complete the OGR acquisition and for working
capital. The bridge loan was outstanding until January 29, 2007 and had an average interest rate
of 10.6%. Interest expense for the first nine months of 2007 includes the write-off of deferred
financing fees of $1.2 million related to the repayment of the bridge loan. Interest expense
includes amortization expense of deferred financing costs of $1.5 million and $742,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively.

Our provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $24.8 million, or
35.7% of our net income before income taxes, compared to $6.2 million, or 19.7% of our net income
before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The increase in income taxes is
attributable to our higher operating income and a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax
rate in the 2006 period was favorably impacted by the reversal of the valuation allowance on our
deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was reversed due to operating results that allowed
for the realization of our deferred tax assets. As of January 1, 2007, no valuation allowance
remained and had no impact on the 2007 effective tax rate.

We had net income of $44.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, an increase of
76.7%, compared to net income of $25.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006.

The following table compares revenues and income from operations for each of our business segments
and loss of income for general corporate purposes. Income (loss) from operations consists of
revenues less cost of revenues, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and
amortization:

Rental Services Segment

Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 for the Rental Services segment were $92.9
million, an increase from $36.3 million in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2006.
Income from operations increased to $41.2 million in the first nine months of 2007 compared to
$18.9 million in the first nine months of 2006. Our Rental Services segment revenues and operating
income for the first nine months of 2007 increased compared to the prior year due primarily to the
OGR acquisition on December 18, 2006. Income from operations as a percentage of revenues decreased
to 44.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 compared to 52.0% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2006 as a result of higher depreciation expense associated with OGR acquisition and
capital expenditures. The increase in revenues and operating income which resulted from the OGR
acquisition was partially offset by the impact of decreased U.S. Gulf of Mexico drilling activity
in 2007 compared to the previous year, including the impact of hurricanes during the 2007 third
quarter.

Table of Contents

International Drilling Segment

On August 14, 2006, we acquired DLS which established our International Drilling segment. Revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 for the International Drilling segment were $160.3
million, an increase from $23.9 million in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2006.
Income from operations increased to $30.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007
compared to $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006.

Directional Drilling Segment

Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 for our Directional Drilling segment were
$69.4 million, an increase of 25.7% from the $55.2 million in revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2006. Income from operations increased 17.8% to $14.3 million for the first nine
months of 2007 from $12.1 million for the comparable 2006 period. The improved results for this
segment are due to improved pricing for directional and horizontal drilling and the purchase of
additional MWD tools and downhole motors, offset in part by increased expenses for the downhole
motor rentals and repairs and increased labor costs.

Tubular Services Segment

Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 for the Tubular Services segment were $41.0
million, an increase of 8.6% from the $37.8 million in revenues for the nine months ended September
30, 2006. Revenues from domestic operations increased to $34.8 million in the first nine months of
2007 from $33.1 million in the first nine months of 2006 as a result of the acquisition of Rogers.
Revenues from operations in Mexico were $6.2 million for the first nine months of 2007 and $4.7
million for the first nine months of 2006. Income from operations decreased 12.4% to $8.7 million
in the first nine months of 2007 from $9.9 million in the first nine months of 2006. The decrease
in this segment’s operating income was due to an increased competitive pricing environment
domestically and decreased sales of power tongs from the same period in the preceding year.

Underbalanced Drilling Segment

Our Underbalanced Drilling segment revenues were $36.4 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2007, an increase of 13.7% compared to $32.0 million in revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2006. Income from operations increased to $9.2 million in the first nine months of
2007 compared to income from operations of $8.6 million in the first nine months of 2006. Our
Underbalanced Drilling segment revenues and operating income for the first nine months of 2007
increased compared to the first nine months of 2006 primarily due to our investment in additional
equipment.

Production Services Segment

Revenues were $27.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 for the Production
Services segment, an increase of 149.5% compared to $10.9 million in revenues for the nine months
ended September 30, 2006. Income from operations increased to $11.9 million in the first nine
months of 2007 compared to $737,000 in the first nine months of 2006. Our Production Services
segment revenues and operating income for the first nine months of 2007 increased compared to the
first nine months of 2006 due primarily to our acquisition of Petro Rentals on October 17, 2006,
the gain from the sale of capillary assets and the addition of two coil tubing units in the fourth
quarter of 2006 and one additional unit in the first quarter of 2007. Operating results for this
segment for the first nine months of 2007 were impacted by the sale of our capillary tubing assets
and an increase in personnel and training expenses for the crews in anticipation of the delivery
and activation of new coil tubing units which were delayed in their delivery.

General Corporate

General corporate expenses increased $1.2 million to $11.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2007 compared to $10.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The
increase was due to the increase in payroll costs and benefits for additional management,
accounting and administrative staff as a result of the acquisitions and to support our growing
organization and increased franchise taxes based on our increased authorized shares.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our on-going capital requirements arise primarily from our need to service our debt, to complete
acquisitions, to acquire and maintain equipment, and to fund our working capital requirements. Our
primary sources of liquidity are proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities and cash
flows from operations. We had cash and cash equivalents of $63.1 million at September 30, 2007
compared to $39.7 million at December 31, 2006.

Operating Activities

In the nine months ended September 30, 2007, our operating activities provided $60.8 million in
cash. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $44.7 million. Net non-cash
expenses totaled $38.7 million during the first nine months of 2007 consisting of $40.2 million of
depreciation and amortization, $3.1 million for deferred income taxes, $2.7 million for the
amortization and write-off of financing fees, $2.1 million from the expensing of stock options,
$441,000 from increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivables, less $10.0 million on
the gain from asset disposals.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2007, changes in operating assets and liabilities used
$22.5 million in cash, principally due to an increase of $36.8 million in accounts receivable, an
increase of $5.0 million in inventory, and a decrease of $5.1 million in accrued interest, offset
in part by a decrease in other current assets of $10.6 million, an increase of $1.3 million in
accounts payable, an increase of $10.0 million in accrued expenses and an increase in accrued
salaries, benefits and payroll taxes of $2.4 million. Accounts receivable increased primarily due
to the increase in our revenues in the first nine months of 2007. Other inventory increased
primarily due to the build-up of inventory to meet the demands of increased activity levels in our
International Drilling segment. The decrease in accrued interest is due to the semi-annual payment
of interest on our 9.0% senior notes. The decrease in other current assets is principally due to
the collection of the working capital adjustment from the OGR acquisition for approximately $7.1
million in the first quarter of 2007. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and
accrued salaries, benefits and payroll taxes is attributed to additional expenses related to higher
activity levels.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2006, our operating activities provided $33.3 million in
cash. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $25.3 million. Non-cash
expenses totaled $17.7 million during the first nine months of 2006 consisting of $13.8 million of
depreciation and amortization, $494,000 for deferred income taxes, $2.6 million from the expensing
of stock options, $742,000 of amortization of financing fees, $355,000 of imputed interest related
to the effective date of the Specialty acquisition, $353,000 related to increases to the allowance
for doubtful accounts receivables, less $728,000 on the gain from asset retirements.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2006, changes in operating assets and liabilities used
$9.6 million in cash, principally due to an increase of $17.2 million in accounts receivable, an
increase of $2.2 million in inventory, a decrease of $1.6 million in accounts payable, offset in
part by an increase of $4.7 million in accrued interest and an increase of $2.5 million in accrued
expenses. Accounts receivable increased due to the increase in our revenues in the first nine
months of 2006. Other inventory increased primarily due to increased activity levels. The
increase in accrued interest relates to our 9.0% senior notes issued in 2006 which is only payable
in January and July. The increase in accrued expenses can be attributed to additional income tax
liability due to profitability and additional expenses related to higher activity levels.

Investing Activities

During the nine months ended September 30, 2007, we used $77.2 million in investing activities,
consisting of $86.1 million for capital expenditures, $12.9 million for business acquisitions and
$498,000 for oil and gas investments, offset by $22.2 million of proceeds from asset sales.
Included in the $86.1 million for capital expenditures was $31.1 million for drill pipe and other
equipment used in our Rental Services segment, $16.9 million for additional equipment in our
International Drilling segment, $15.3 million for additional equipment in our Underbalanced
Drilling segment, $8.6 million for additional equipment in our Production Services segment, $6.9
million for additional equipment in our Tubular Services segment and $6.7 million primarily for
additional MWD equipment used in the Directional Drilling segment,. We received proceeds of $16.3
million from the sale of our capillary assets and $6.0 million from the proceeds from asset sales
in connection with items “lost in hole” by our customers or other asset sales.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2006, we used $225.5 million in investing activities,
consisting of $95.8 million for the acquisition of Specialty, net of cash received, $10.7 million
for the acquisition of Rogers, net of cash received, $96.6 million for the acquisition of DLS, net
of cash received and $25.8 million for capital expenditures, offset by $3.5 million of proceeds
from equipment sales. Included in the $25.8 million for capital expenditures was $ 7.8 million for
equipment used in our casing and tubing segment, $3.0 million for the expansion of our MWD
equipment used in the directional drilling segment, $6.3 million for additional equipment in our
compressed air drilling services segment and $3.1 million for our international drilling segment.
A majority of our equipment sales relate to items “lost in hole” by our customers.

Financing Activities

During the nine months ended September 30, 2007, financing activities provided $39.7 million in
cash. We received $250.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt, repaid $307.5 million in
borrowings under long-term debt facilities, including the repayment of the bridge loan, and paid
$7.6 million in debt issuance costs. We also received $100.1 million from the issuance of our
common stock in a public offering, net of expenses along with $3.3 million in proceeds from the
exercise of options and warrants. We recognized a tax benefit of $1.6 million related to our stock
compensation plans.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2006, financing activities provided $240.5 million in
cash. We received $257.8 million in proceeds from long-term debt, repaid $51.7 million in
borrowings under long-term debt facilities, repaid $3.0 million in related party debt, repaid $6.4
million net under our line of credit and paid $8.0 million in debt issuance costs. We also
received $46.5 million from the issuance of our common stock in a public offering, net of expenses
along with $5.4 million in proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants..

At September 30, 2007, we had $516.5 million in outstanding indebtedness, of which $508.9 million
was long term debt and $7.6 million is due within one year.

On January 18, 2006 and August 14, 2006, we closed on private offerings, to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, of $160.0 and $95.0 million
aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, respectively. The senior notes are due January 15,
2014 and bear interest at 9.0%. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisitions of Specialty and
DLS to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes.

On January 18, 2006, we also executed an amended and restated credit agreement which provided for a
$25.0 million revolving line of credit with a maturity of January 2010. Our January 2006 amended
and restated credit agreement contained customary events of default and financial covenants and
limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay dividends or
make other distributions, create liens and sell assets. Our obligations under the January 2006
amended and restated credit agreement were secured by substantially all of our assets located in
the United States.

On December 18, 2006, we closed on a $300.0 million senior unsecured bridge loan. The bridge loan
was due 18 months after closing and bore a weighted average interest rate of 10.6%. The bridge
loan, which was repaid on January 29, 2007, was used to fund the acquisition of substantially all
of the assets of OGR.

In January 2007, we closed on a private offering, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, of $250.0 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due
2017. The proceeds of the senior notes offering, together with a portion of the proceeds of our
concurrent common stock offering, were used to repay the debt outstanding under our $300.0 million
bridge loan facility which we incurred to finance our acquisition of substantially all the assets
of OGR.

On April 26, 2007, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which increased
our revolving line of credit to $62.0 million, and has a final maturity date of April 26, 2012.
The amended and restated credit agreement contains customary events of default and financial
covenants and limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, pay
dividends or make other distributions, create liens and sell assets. Our obligations under the
amended and restated credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets located in the
United States.

As part of our acquisition of DLS, we assumed various bank loans with floating interest rates based
on LIBOR plus a margin and terms ranging from 2 to 5 years. The weighted average interest rates
were 6.72% and 7.0% at September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The bank loans are
denominated in U.S. dollars and the outstanding amounts due as of September 30, 2007 and December
31, 2006 were $5.5 million and $7.3 million, respectively.

As part of the acquisition of Mountain Compressed Air Inc., or Mountain Air, in 2001, we issued a
note to the sellers of Mountain Air in the original amount of $2.2 million accruing interest at a
rate of 5.75% per annum. The note was reduced to $1.5 million as a result of the settlement of a
legal action against the sellers in 2003. At September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 the
outstanding amounts due were $0 and $150,000, respectively.

In connection with the acquisition of Rogers Oil Tool Services, Inc., or Rogers, we issued to the
seller a note in the amount of $750,000. The note bears interest at 5.0% and is due April 3, 2009.
In connection with the acquisition of Coker Directional Inc., we issued to the seller a note in
the amount of $350,000. The note bears interest at 8.25% and is due June 29, 2008. In connection
with the acquisition of Diggar we issued to the seller a note in the amount of $750,000. The note
bears interest at 6.0% and is due July 26, 2008.

In connection with the purchase of Safco-Oil Field Products, Inc., or Safco, we also agreed to pay
a total of $150,000 to the sellers in exchange for a non-compete agreement. We are required to
make annual payments of $50,000 through September 30, 2007. In connection with the purchase of
Capcoil Tubing Services, Inc., or Capcoil, we agreed to pay a total of $500,000 to two management
employees in exchange for non-compete agreements. We are required to make annual payments of
$110,000 through May 2008. Total amounts due under these non-compete agreements at September 30,
2007 and December 31, 2006 were $160,000 and $270,000, respectively.

In 2000 we compensated directors, including current directors Nederlander and Toboroff, who served
on the board of directors from 1989 to March 31, 1999 without compensation, by issuing promissory
notes totaling $325,000. The notes bore interest at the rate of 5.0%. At September 30 2007 and
December 31, 2006, the principal and accrued interest on these notes totaled approximately $32,000.
We have various equipment and vehicle financing loans with interest rates ranging from 7.85% to
8.7% and terms of 2 to 3 years. As of September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the outstanding
balances for equipment and vehicle financing loans were $942,000 and $3.5 million, respectively.
In April 2006 and August 2006, we obtained insurance premium financings in the amount of $1.9
million and $896,000 with fixed interest rates of 5.6% and 6.0%, respectively. Under terms of the
agreements, amounts outstanding are paid over 10 month and 11 month repayment schedules. In April
2007, we renewed the insurance premium financing in an amount of $3.2 million with a fixed interest
rate of 5.9% and a repayment schedule of 11 months. The outstanding balance of these notes was
approximately $2.9 million and $1.0 million as of September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006,
respectively. We also have various capital leases with terms that expire in 2008. As of September
30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, amounts outstanding under capital leases were $42,000 and $414,000,
respectively.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off balance sheet arrangements, other than normal operating leases and employee
contracts, that have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources. We do not guarantee obligations of any unconsolidated
entities. At September 30, 2007, we had a $62.0 million revolving line of credit with a maturity
of April 2012.  At September 30, 2007, no amounts were borrowed on the facility but availability is
reduced by outstanding letters of credit of $8.8 million. 

Capital Requirements

We have identified capital expenditure projects that will require approximately $38.0 million for
the remainder of 2007, exclusive of any acquisitions. We believe that our current cash generated
from operations, cash available under our credit facilities and cash on hand will provide
sufficient funds for our identified projects.

We intend to implement a growth strategy of increasing the scope of services through both internal
growth and acquisitions. We are regularly involved in discussions with a number of potential
acquisition candidates. The acquisition of assets could require additional financing. We also
expect to make capital expenditures to acquire and to maintain our existing equipment. Our
performance and cash flow from operations will be determined by the demand for our services which
in turn are affected by our customers’ expenditures for oil and gas exploration and development,
and industry perceptions and expectations of future oil and natural gas prices in the areas where
we operate. We will need to refinance our existing debt facilities as they become due and provide
funds for capital expenditures and acquisitions. To effect our expansion plans, we may require
additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in
raising the additional debt or equity capital or that we can do so on terms that will be acceptable
to us.

Recent Developments

On October 23, 2007, we purchased all of the issued and outstanding stock of Rebel Rentals, Inc.,
or Rebel Rentals, for an aggregate purchase price of $6.75 million. The acquisition of Rebel
Rentals adds additional equipment and support to our casing and tubing operations in our Tubular
Services segment.

On November 1, 2007, we purchased substantially all the assets of Diamondback Oilfield Services,
Inc., or Diamondback, for a purchase price of $22.0 million. This acquisition expands the operations of Allis-Chalmers’
Directional Drilling segment further into the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma. The acquisition of
Diamondback adds additional personnel and equipment, including approximately 18 directional
drillers, 30 downhole motors, five measurement-while-drilling tools, and eight wireline steering
vehicles

Critical Accounting Policies

Please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 for a description of
other policies that are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of
operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business
operations is discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. No
material changes to such information have occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2007.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance
with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. It prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1,
2007 and such adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Our policy is that we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as
a component of income tax expense. As of the date of adoption of FIN 48, we did not have any
accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits. For United States
federal tax purposes, our tax returns for the tax years 2001 through 2006 remain open for
examination by the tax authorities. Our foreign tax returns remain open for examination for the
tax years 2001 through 2006. Generally, for state tax purposes, our 2002 through 2006 tax years
remain open for examination by the tax authorities under a four year statute of limitations,
however, certain states may keep their statute open for six to ten years.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”), which is
intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements by defining fair
value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 157
and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities (“SFAS 159”), which permits entities to elect to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value.  Upon adoption of SFAS 159, an entity may elect
the fair value option for eligible items that exist at the adoption date. Subsequent to the initial
adoption, the election of the fair value option should only be made at the initial recognition of
the asset or liability or upon a re-measurement event that gives rise to the new-basis of
accounting. All subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument are reported in earnings.
SFAS No. 159 does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and
liabilities to be recorded at fair value nor does it eliminate disclosure requirements included in
other accounting standards. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity’s
first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the provisions
of SFAS 159 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our financial statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, regarding our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends,
plans, believes, seeks, estimates and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. However, these are not the exclusive means of identifying
forward-looking statements. Although such forward-looking statements reflect our good faith
judgment, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known to us.
Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and
actual outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the
forward-looking statements. Further information about the risks and uncertainties that may impact
us are described under “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2006. You should read those sections carefully. You should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this quarterly report. We
undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any
event or circumstance occurring after the date of this quarterly report or currently unknown facts
or conditions or the occurrence of unanticipated events.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency
exchange risks.

Interest Rate Risk.

Fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable
rate debt obligations expose us to market risk. We are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in
interest rates affecting our adjustable rate debt, and any future refinancing of our fixed rate
debt and our future debt.

As part of our acquisition of DLS, we assumed various bank loans carrying variable interest rates
with an outstanding balance of $5.5 million as of September 30, 2007.

We have also been subject to interest rate market risk for short-term invested cash and cash
equivalents. The principal of such invested funds would not be subject to fluctuating value
because of their highly liquid short-term nature. As of September 30, 2007, we had $63.7 million
invested in short-term investments.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.

We have designated the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for our operations in international
locations as we contract with customers, purchase equipment and finance capital using the U.S.
dollar. Local currency transaction gains and losses, arising from remeasurement of certain assets
and liabilities denominated in local currency, are included in our consolidated statements of
income. We conduct business in Mexico through our Mexican partner, Matyep. This business exposes
us to foreign exchange risk. To control this risk, we provide for payment in U.S. dollars.
However, we have historically provided our partner a discount upon payment equal to 50% of any loss
suffered by our partner as a result of devaluation of the Mexican peso between the date of
invoicing and the date of payment. To date, such payments have not been material in amount.




ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.


As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we have evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e)
and 15d – 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the “Exchange Act”. This
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based on this evaluation, these
officers have concluded that, as of September 30, 2007, our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed
by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules and
forms.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures.

(b) Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September
30, 2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

consistent with Executive’s employment prior to the date hereof. Company shall use its best efforts
(including by nominating Executive to be a director at each meeting of the stockholders of the
company at which directors are elected, and including in any proxy statement relating to such a
meeting information comparable to that included with respect to other nominees) to cause Executive
to be maintained as a director of the Company and while a director Executive shall serve as

investor as well as participate in activities of charitable organizations of his choice so long as
they do not materially interfere with his duties for Company. Company acknowledges and agrees that

practices pursuant to Section 6 hereof.

     Section 4. Term. The term of employment of Executive hereunder shall commence on the Effective
Date and terminate three years thereafter, provided that if Executive at the end of such three year
period remains liable for any guarantees of obligations of the Company, then the term

4



 

hereof shall
extend for such period as Executive remains liable for such guarantees.

     Section 5. Compensation and Benefits. In consideration for the services of Executive

hereof):

     (a) Salary. Company shall pay Executive, semi-monthly in arrears with its normal
payroll procedures, a salary which is equivalent to an annual rate of $500,000 (the
“Salary”). The Salary shall increase annually, effective as of each anniversary of the
Effective Date by the same percentage as the percentage of increase, if any, shown by the
All Items Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers published by the
U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim
area for the month of March immediately preceding the previous anniversary of the Effective
Date,, as compared with the most recently published Index at the applicable date. If the
Bureau of Labor Statistics ceases to use the 1967 average of 100 as the basis for
calculation for the Consumer Price Index or if a substantial change is made in the items or
number of items contained in the Consumer Price Index, then the Consumer Price Index shall
be adjusted to that figure that would have been arrived at if the change in the manner of
computing the Consumer Price Index in effect at the applicable date had not been altered. If
the Consumer Price Index described above is no longer published at the time of such fee
calculation, the Company shall select and use a similar reliable governmental or other
non-partisan publication evaluating the kind of information theretofore used in determining
such Consumer Price Index. Any additional increase in the Salary shall be in the sole
discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.

     (b) Management Incentive Bonus; Stock Options; Performance Awards.

     (i) Executive shall be eligible to receive an annual bonus equal to 100% of
Executive’s salary if the Company’s Compensation Committee determines that the
Company has met the performance goals established by the Compensation Committee.
Such performance goals shall be established no later than ninety days after the
first day of the performance year (provided that the outcome is substantially
uncertain at the time the criteria are established). The annual bonus (other than a
bonus for the final year of the term of this Agreement) shall be subject to
Executive’s continued employment on the date of payment (other than by reason of
death or Disability), and shall be paid as soon as practicable after the
Compensation Committee determines that the performance goals were satisfied but in
no event later than two-and-one-half months following the applicable performance
year. Such bonus shall be paid in cash or, at the option of Executive, made by
written election filed by Executive with the Company Secretary by the last day of
the performance year in shares of the Company’s Common Stock (for such purpose the
shares shall be valued at “Fair Market Value” (as defined in the Incentive Plan) at
the payment date).

     (ii) In addition, Executive shall be entitled to receive such other incentive
bonuses as may be provided in management incentive bonus plans adopted from time to
time by Company.

     (iii) In addition, Executive shall receive an option to acquire 200,000 shares
of Common Stock of the Company pursuant to the Incentive Plan, which option was
granted on August 3, 2007 at the then current market value of the Common Stock;
provided that such option shall vest no less rapidly than twenty percent (20%) one
year after the date of grant; an additional twenty percent (20%) two years after the
date of grant; and the remaining sixty percent (60%) three years after the date of
grant or, if sooner, one hundred percent (100%) upon the earlier of (A) a Change In
Control, as defined in the Incentive Plan, or if not so defined therein, as defined
in Section 1(c), or (B) termination of Executive’s employment without Cause, as
defined in Section 7(a)(iii). Such option shall be a nonqualified stock option

shares of Common Stock in the form of restricted stock (the “Restricted Shares”),

taken at times which are reasonably and mutually convenient to both Company and Executive.

     (d) Insurance Benefits. Company shall provide accident, health, dental, disability and
life insurance for Executive under the group accident, health, dental, disability and life

Company or its successor to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable or
distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (a
“Payment”), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code

upon the Payment. The applicable Gross-Up Payment shall be made to Executive as soon as
practicable after written request for payment is submitted by Executive to Company or its
successor, but in no event later than the end of the calendar year next following the year
in which Executive remits the applicable Excise Tax.. All determinations made under this

Excise Tax or income or other tax (including interest, penalties, additions to tax, or
additional amounts with respect thereto) imposed on Executive as a result of such payment of
fees and expenses. In addition, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Executive, on
an after-tax basis, for any fees or costs incurred in connection with any contest of

on Executive as a result of such payments of fees and expenses.

guaranteed debt outstanding during the prior quarter.

term life insurance policy on the life of Executive owned by Company.

law, Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Executive, Executive’s spouse

attorneys, accountants, consultants and experts), damages, obligations to third parties,
expenditures, proceedings, taxes, judgments, awards or demands, whether or not arising from
claims of third parties (collectively, “Losses”), which any of them may suffer, incur or

executive or his spouse with respect to obligations of Company or its subsidiaries.

defined in Section 409A and determined as described below in this Section 13(b), any

409A that are payable as a result of Executive’s termination (other than death) shall not be
payable before the earliest of (i) the date that is six months after Executive’s
termination, (ii) the date of Executive’s death, or (iii) the earliest date that otherwise
complies with the requirements of Section 409A. This Section 13(b) shall be applied by

Executive’s termination and paying such accumulated amounts at the earliest date which
complies with or is exempt from the application of the requirements of Section 409A.
Executive shall be a “specified employee” for the twelve-month period beginning on April 1

Upon resolution by the Committee that the Participant has achieved the Performance Objectives, and
subject to the other terms and conditions of this Performance Award Agreement, the Company will

transfer, pledge, exchange, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in
the Performance Award prior to vesting in accordance with this Performance Award Agreement. Upon

certificate(s), subject to compliance with (i) the terms and conditions of the Plan and this
Performance Award Agreement, (ii) applicable federal or state securities laws or other applicable
law, (iii) applicable rules of any exchange on which the Company’s securities are traded or listed,

Plan), all restrictions and conditions of the Performance Award shall automatically be
waived without any required action by the Company, Committee or the Board with the result
that the Performance Award shall be fully vested and the restrictions thereon shall have
lapsed.

     (b) Right of Cash-Out. If approved by the Board prior to or within thirty (30) days
after such time as a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred, the Board shall
have the right for a forty-five (45) day period immediately following the date that the
Change in Control is deemed to have occurred to require Participant to transfer and deliver
to Company all unvested shares of the Performance Award hereunder with respect to which the
restrictions have not lapsed in exchange for an amount equal to the “cash value” (defined
below) of such shares of the Performance Award. Such right shall be exercised by written
notice to Participant. The cash value of such shares of the Performance Award shall equal
the “market value” (defined below) per share, multiplied by the number of unvested shares of
the Performance Award hereunder with respect to

value” per share shall mean the higher of (i) the average of the Fair Market Value per share

Control is deemed to have occurred or (ii) the highest price, if any, offered in connection
with the Change in Control. The amount payable to Participant by Company pursuant to this
Section 8(b) shall be paid in cash or by certified check and shall be reduced by any taxes
required to be withheld.

not affect in any way the right or power of the Company or its stockholders to make or authorize
any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in the Company’s
capital structure or its business, or any merger or consolidation of the Company or any issue of
bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Performance Award
or the rights thereof, or the dissolution or liquidation of Company, or any sale or transfer of all
or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a
similar character or otherwise.

     10. Adjustment of Shares. In the event of stock dividends, spin-offs of assets or other
extraordinary dividends, stock splits, combinations of shares, recapitalizations, mergers,
consolidations, reorganizations, liquidations, issuances of rights or warrants and similar
transactions or events involving Company, the Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem
equitable, make adjustments to the terms and provisions of this Performance Award Agreement.

     11. Certain Restrictions. By executing this Performance Award Agreement, Participant agrees
that if at the time of delivery of certificates representing the Performance Award is not covered
by an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Act”), the
certificates so delivered may contain such legends as the Company shall require and the Participant
will acquire the shares of the Performance Award for Participant’s own account and without a view
to resale or distribution in violation of the Act or any other securities law, and upon any such
acquisition Participant will enter into such written representations, warranties and agreements as
Company may reasonably request in order to comply with the Act or any other securities law or with
this Performance Award Agreement. Participant agrees that the Company shall not be obligated to
take any affirmative action in order to cause the issuance or transfer of shares of the Performance
Award hereunder to comply with any law, rule or regulation that applies to the shares of Common
Stock subject to this Performance Award Agreement.

     12. Amendment and Termination. The Performance Award Agreement may not be terminated by the
Board or the Committee at any time without the written consent of Participant. This Performance
Award Agreement may be amended in writing by the Company and Participant, provided the Company may
amend this Performance Award Agreement unilaterally (i) if the amendment does not adversely affect
the Participant’s rights hereunder in any material respect, (ii) if the Company determines that an
amendment is necessary to comply with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act or other applicable law, or
(iii) if the Company determines that an amendment is necessary to meet the requirements of the Code
or to prevent adverse tax consequences to the Participant. No amendment or termination of the Plan
will adversely affect the rights and privileges of Participant under this Performance Award
Agreement or to the Common Stock granted hereunder without the written consent of Participant.

- 3 -



 

     13. No Guarantee of Employment. Neither this Performance Award Agreement nor the Performance
Award evidenced hereby shall confer upon Participant any right with respect to continuance of
employment or other service with the Company or any Affiliate, nor shall it interfere in any way
with any right Company or any Affiliate would otherwise have to terminate such Participant’s
employment or other service at any time.

     14. Tax Matters.

     (a) Company shall have the right to (i) make deductions from the number of shares of
Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon vesting of the Performance Award and satisfaction of
the conditions precedent under this Performance Award Agreement in an amount sufficient to
satisfy withholding of any federal, state or local taxes required by law, or (ii) take such
other action as may be necessary or appropriate to satisfy any such tax withholding
obligations.

     (b) Under Section 83 of the Code, the difference between the purchase price paid, if
any, for the shares of Performance ``Award and their fair market value on the date of
vesting when any forfeiture restrictions applicable to such shares lapse will be reportable
as ordinary income at that time. Participant may elect to be taxed at the effective time of
this award when the shares are acquired rather than when such shares vest and cease to be
subject to such forfeiture restrictions by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the
Code with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days after the date hereof. If
such an election is made, Participant will have to make a tax payment to the extent the
purchase price, if any, is less than the fair market value of the shares on the date hereof.
No tax payment will have to be made to the extent the purchase price, if any, is at least
equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date hereof. Failure to make this
filing within the thirty (30) day period will result in the recognition of ordinary income
by you as the shares of Restricted Stock vest and the forfeiture restrictions lapse.

     PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS PARTICIPANT’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT THE
COMPANY’S, TO FILE A TIMELY ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b) IF PARTICIPANT ELECTS TO DO SO,
EVEN IF PARTICIPANT REQUESTS THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THIS FILING ON
PARTICIPANT’S BEHALF. PARTICIPANT MUST AND IS RELYING SOLELY ON PARTICIPANT’S OWN ADVISORS
WITH RESPECT TO THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO FILE ANY SECTION 83(b) ELECTION.

     (c) Neither Company nor the Board or Committee makes any commitment or guarantee that
any federal or state tax treatment will apply or be available to any person eligible for the
benefits under this Performance Award Agreement.

     15. Community Interest of Spouse. The community interest, if any, of any spouse of
Participant in any Performance Award shall be subject to all of the terms, conditions and
restrictions of this Performance Award Agreement and the Plan.

     16. Consent to Electronic Delivery; Electronic Signature. In lieu of receiving documents in
paper format, Participant agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to accept electronic
delivery of any documents that the Company may be required to deliver (including,
but not limited to, prospectuses, prospectus supplements, grant or award notifications and
agreements, account statements, annual and quarterly reports, and all other forms of

- 4 -



 

communications) in connection with this and any other award made or offered by the Company.
Electronic delivery may be via a Company electronic mail system or by reference to a location on a
Company intranet to which Participant has access. Participant hereby consents to any and all
procedures the Company has established or may establish for an electronic signature system for
delivery and acceptance of any such documents that the Company may be required to deliver, and
agrees that his or her electronic signature is the same as, and shall have the same force and
effect as, his or her manual signature.

     17. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Performance Award Agreement shall
be held illegal, invalid, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be fully severable,
but shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Performance Award Agreement, and this
Performance Award Agreement shall be construed and enforced as of the illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision had never been included herein.

     18. Governing Law. This Performance Award Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware to the extent federal law does not supersede and preempt Delaware
law.
