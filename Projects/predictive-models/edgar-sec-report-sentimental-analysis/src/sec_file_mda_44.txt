marketing a new single premium whole life policy in 1998 this product accounted for 2.4 million of new premiums. as expected, premiums decreased due to fewer annuitizations, the termination of non essential nai lines and the sale of north american fire casualty insurance company at the end of 1998 to republic. these changes accounted for a 6.6 million decrease in premiums through the first six months of 1999. net investment income before intercompany eliminations was 10.1 million for the six months ended june 30, 1999 and 9.4 million for 1998. this increase is due to the increase in the

six months ended june 30, 1999 and 1998. cash flows provided by financing activities were approximately 0.3 million and 7.1 million for the six months ended june 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. cash flows from deferred annuity sales increase investment contract deposits, which are a component of financing activities, as well as the purchase of fixed maturities, which are a component of investing activities. the decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities for the first six months of 1999 compared to the first six months of 1998 is due to lower ratio of annuity deposits to withdrawals. in addition to cash flows from operating and financing activities, a substantial amount of liquid funds is available through oxford's short term portfolio. at june 30, 1999 and 1998, short term investments were 75.6 million and 22.0 million, respectively. management believes that the overall sources of liquidity will continue to meet foreseeable cash needs. stockholder's equity of oxford increased to 90.7 million in 1999 from 90.1 million in 1998. oxford did not pay dividends to its parent in 1999 or 1998. applicable laws and regulations of the state of arizona require amerco's insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum capital and surplus determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. with respect to oxford, the amount is 450,000. in addition, the amount of dividends that can be paid to shareholders by insurance companies domiciled in the state of arizona is limited. any dividend in excess of the limit requires prior regulatory approval. statutory surplus which can be distributed as dividends without regulatory approval is 0.7 million at june 30, 1999. these restrictions are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of amerco to meet its cash obligation. consolidated group during each of the fiscal years ended march 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, u haul estimates gross capital expenditures will average approximately 325 million primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation. this level of capital expenditures, combined with an average of approximately 30 115 million in annual long term debt maturities during this same period, are expected to create annual average funding needs of approximately 355 440 million. management estimates that u haul will fund 100 of these requirements with internally generated funds, including proceeds from the disposition of older trucks and other asset sales. credit agreements amerco's operations are funded by various credit and financing arrangements, including unsecured long term borrowings, unsecured medium term notes, and revolving lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks. principally to finance its fleet of trucks and trailers, amerco routinely enters into sale and leaseback transactions. as of september 30, 1999, amerco had 1,087.4 million in total notes and loans payable outstanding and unutilized lines of credit of approximately 225.0 million. certain of amerco's credit agreements contain restrictive financial and other covenants, including, among others, covenants with respect to incurring additional indebtedness, maintaining certain financial ratios, and placing certain additional liens on its properties and assets. at september 30, 1999, amerco was in compliance with these covenants. amerco is further restricted in the issuance of certain types of preferred stock. amerco is prohibited from issuing shares of preferred stock that provide for any mandatory redemption, sinking fund payment, or mandatory prepayment, or that allow the holders thereof to require amerco or any subsidiary of amerco to repurchase such preferred stock at the option of such holders or upon the occurrence of any event or events without the consent of its lenders. 31 year 2000 disclosure amerco is and has been working since 1997 to identify and complete the changes necessary to its existing computerized business systems to make these systems compliant for year 2000 processing. the year 2000 processing problem is caused by currently installed computer systems and software products, including several used by amerco, being coded to accept only the last two digit entries in the date code field instead of four digits to indicate the year. such programs may interpret the year 2000 to mean 1900 instead, producing erroneous information or date related computer failures. amerco's date reliance functions related to the year 2000 and beyond, such as rental transaction processing and financial systems, may be adversely affected unless these computer systems are or become year 2000 compliant on a timely basis. replacing, upgrading or modifying key financial systems has been on going in the normal course of business. amerco is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify, correct, reprogram and test its systems for year 2000 compliance. in particular, amerco has an outside consulting firm on site currently making the year 2000 compliance related modifications to existing systems. amerco's internal information technology conversion phase is underway, with the testing phase going on at the same time. amerco has communicated with its major business partners to determine the efforts being made on their part for compliance. electronic data interchange with critical vendors has been tested. testing has been completed with major banking partners and credit card processors. approximately 90 of major business partners have given amerco written assurances that they will be year 2000 compliant. however, there can be no assurance amerco will not be adversely affected by the failure of others to become year 2000 compliant. for example, amerco may be affected by, among other things, the failure of inventory suppliers, credit card processors, security companies or other vendors and service providers to become year 2000 compliant. amerco expects all of its critical systems to be year 2000 compliant by calendar year end. amerco started with an initial budget of 2.0 million as the conversion process continued, this amount was increased to 2.8 million. through september 30, 1999, 2.5 million has been incurred for year 2000 related work. amerco has not deferred any major computer programming or update projects due to year 2000 efforts. although amerco believes it will achieve compliance on a timely basis, no assurance can be given that amerco's computer systems will be year 2000 compliant in a timely manner or that amerco will not incur significant additional costs pursuing year 2000 compliance. if the appropriate modifications are not made, or are not timely, the year 2000 problem may have a material adverse effect on amerco. amerco considers its most likely worst case scenario to be if a business partner is not year 2000 compliant and direct processing of electronic data is inhibited. amerco's contingency plan, to be used if a business partner is not year 2000 compliant, will include manual processing of rental transactions manual preparation of payments to employees, vendors and claimants manual licensing of equipment manual preparation of financial statements and the movement of funds. amerco expects that the cost of conducting business manually would not have a material impact on its financial position. while amerco feels testing has been adequate and successful, the contingency plans have been formulated, with refinement continuing until the year 2000. despite amerco's efforts to date, there can be no assurance that the year 2000 problem will not have a material adverse effect on amerco in the future. 32
